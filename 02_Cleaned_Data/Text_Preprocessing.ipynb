EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG), a Delaware corporation organized in 1985, together with Investor contact\\nits subsidiaries, explores for, develops, produces, and markets natural gas and crude oil primarily in major P. W. Hammond (713 651 7000)\\nproducing basins in the U.S., Canada, offshore Trinidad, the U.K. North Sea, China, and other select regions.\\nProved oil and gas reserves rose 6.1% in 2023 to 4,498 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE; 67% liquids, Office\\n52% developed), helped by drilling and extensions along with an improvement in natural gas prices. About 1111 Bagby Street, Sky Lobby 2, Houston, Texas, 77002\\n99% of EOG\\u2019s 2023 proved reserves were in the U.S., and 1% were in Trinidad.\\nTelephone\\nAverage daily production of 984,700 boe/d in 2023 was up 8.4% versus 2022, with liquids production up 713 651 7000\\n6.2% and natural gas production up 14%. For the 2023 fiscal year, EOG\\u2019s crude oil production achieved an\\naverage realized price of $79.17 per barrel, down 19% from $79.21 per barrel in 2022. On its natural gas Fax\\nliquids (NGL) production, EOG\\u2019s average realized price of $23.07 per barrel was down 37% versus 2022, 713 651 6995\\nwhich we attribute to weaker demand from Asia. NGLs are often used in the manufacturing of plastics and\\nWebsite\\nconsumer packaging, which were very strong in 2021 due to the pandemic (such as from higher demand for\\nwww.eogresources.com\\nhand sanitizer bottles made using NGLs). EOG\\u2019s realized price on natural gas production ($2.79 per\\nthousand cubic feet) was down 60% from the $6.93/MMBtu in 2022.

EOG\\u2019s business strategy is to maximize the rate of return on investment of capital over the\\nJ. R. Leitzell\\nlong term by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries. This strategy is\\nintended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-\\neffective basis. In early 2016, EOG refined its liquids strategy and now focuses on a \\u201cpremium drilling\\u201d Board Members\\nstrategy. The company defines a premium well as one which can generate a direct after-tax rate of return C. C. Gaut J. J. Robertson\\n(ATROR) of at least 30% at $40 crude oil. The premium drilling strategy accounted for 50% of total wells in\\nC. R. Crisp L. A. Dugle\\n2016 (owing, we believe, to already in-progress non-premium drilling before the premium strategy was\\nD. F. Textor M. T. Kerr\\ndelineated). For 2024, EOG is persisting with its \\u2018double premium\\u2019 strategy, whereby it seeks out well\\nlocations that it thinks can achieve +60% ATRORs at the same WTI price assumption of $40 per barrel. E. Y. Yacob R. P. Daniels\\nIn February 2024, EOG guided to a capital spending range in 2023 of $6.0 billion-$6.4 billion, which is down J. F.

We estimate that EOG can still generate a solid free cash\\nflow surplus even at this level, should that occur, and we see production rising in the high-single digits in\\nDomicile Auditor\\n2024.\\nDelaware Deloitte & Touche LLP\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. We believe that the original shift to the premium drilling strategy was\\npredicated on the goal of driving production costs down to globally competitive levels and not merely to beat Founded\\nthe U.S. unconventional shale cost curve. At that time, EOG estimated it had 3,200 premium locations to 1985\\ndrill, with the potential of 2 billion boe reserve. In November 2017, EOG updated that analysis, noting 8,000\\nEmployees\\nsuch locations with approximately 7.3 billion boe reserve potential. As of early 2023, EOG believes it has\\n3,050\\nmore than 11,000 undrilled premium locations.

It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic.\\nThe reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival Exxon Mobil Corp., which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.\\nBy some measures, the pandemic hit the energy industry harder than any other major segment of the U.S. economy in 2020. Oil-and-gas companies collectively lost more market value, on a percentage basis, from the beginning of the year than any other major sector. Dozens of companies sought chapter 11 protection from creditors, while tens of thousands of oil workers have lost their jobs.\\nThe sizable spending cuts by Exxon and Chevron this week mean that there will be even less work for the oil-field services companies that employ many of the industry's ground-level workers, and that oil regions in many parts of the world will see reduced economic activity.\\n\\\"Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,\\\" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.\\nIn October, Chevron told investors it would spend around $14 billion in 2021 and indicated its long-term budget could be reduced as well. Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet.\\nThe company's share price is down about 5% over the past six months and closed at $89.78, up 0.1%, Thursday.\\nPierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said the company's spending plans represent an expectation of lower commodity prices over the next five years.\\n\\\"It also reflects that we are an industry performing poorly relative to other investment opportunities,\\\" Mr. Breber said. \\\"Everything [Chevron is] looking at is through the lens of capital discipline and generating higher returns.\\\"\\nCovid-19 has gutted demand for oil and gas as automobile and plane travel declined sharply amid global lockdowns and other measures to contain the virus. Chevron has let its production slide due to the weakened demand, choosing to give priority to directing its cash flow to dividend payments. It reiterated Thursday its commitment to its dividend.\\nEven before the pandemic, the fossil-fuel industry was contending with an oversupply of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers, increased competition from renewable-energy sources and electric vehicles, while also contending with the prospect of increased climate-change regulation.\\nSince the end of last year, Chevron has been implementing a year-long restructuring in response to an anticipated period of prolonged low commodity prices. It is in the process of cutting up to 15% of its 45,000-person staff.\\nIn July, Chevron agreed to acquire Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, one of the larger energy deals this year. Chevron didn't say Thursday how much of its capital spending would be directed to Noble's assets. It previously said it expects about $300 million in annual cost savings from integrating Noble.\\nPaul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research, said Chevron's capital cuts are significant, especially because Noble wasn't factored into the prior spending guidance. Still, Mr. Sankey said Chevron is in a better position than many of its peers. \\\"Chevron came into 2020 best prepared in terms of capex and balance sheet, and leaves 2020 in best shape,\\\" he said.\\nChevron said it would increase investments in its stronger assets, including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. shale, including in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. It also said it would invest $300 million in projects related to a transition to a lower-carbon-energy economy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chevron-slash-capital-spending/docview/2466698861/se-2?accountid=7064\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic.\\nThe reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival Exxon Mobil Corp., which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.\\nBy some measures, the pandemic hit the energy industry harder than any other major segment of the U.S. economy in 2020. Oil-and-gas companies collectively lost more market value, on a percentage basis, from the beginning of the year than any other major sector. Dozens of companies sought chapter 11 protection from creditors, while tens of thousands of oil workers have lost their jobs.\\nThe sizable spending cuts by Exxon and Chevron this week mean that there will be even less work for the oil-field services companies that employ many of the industry's ground-level workers, and that oil regions in many parts of the world will see reduced economic activity.\\n\\\"Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,\\\" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.\\nIn October, Chevron told investors it would spend around $14 billion in 2021 and indicated its long-term budget could be reduced as well. Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet.\\nThe company's share price is down about 5% over the past six months and closed at $89.78, up 0.1%, Thursday.\\nPierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said the company's spending plans represent an expectation of lower commodity prices over the next five years.\\n\\\"It also reflects that we are an industry performing poorly relative to other investment opportunities,\\\" Mr. Breber said. \\\"Everything [Chevron is] looking at is through the lens of capital discipline and generating higher returns.\\\"\\nCovid-19 has gutted demand for oil and gas as automobile and plane travel declined sharply amid global lockdowns and other measures to contain the virus. Chevron has let its production slide due to the weakened demand, choosing to give priority to directing its cash flow to dividend payments. It reiterated Thursday its commitment to its dividend.\\nEven before the pandemic, the fossil-fuel industry was contending with an oversupply of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers, increased competition from renewable-energy sources and electric vehicles, while also contending with the prospect of increased climate-change regulation.\\nSince the end of last year, Chevron has been implementing a year-long restructuring in response to an anticipated period of prolonged low commodity prices. It is in the process of cutting up to 15% of its 45,000-person staff.\\nIn July, Chevron agreed to acquire Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, one of the larger energy deals this year. Chevron didn't say Thursday how much of its capital spending would be directed to Noble's assets. It previously said it expects about $300 million in annual cost savings from integrating Noble.\\nPaul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research, said Chevron's capital cuts are significant, especially because Noble wasn't factored into the prior spending guidance. Still, Mr. Sankey said Chevron is in a better position than many of its peers. \\\"Chevron came into 2020 best prepared in terms of capex and balance sheet, and leaves 2020 in best shape,\\\" he said.\\nChevron said it would increase investments in its stronger assets, including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. shale, including in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. It also said it would invest $300 million in projects related to a transition to a lower-carbon-energy economy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chevron-slash-capital-spending/docview/2466698861/se-2?accountid=7064\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Chief Executive Mike Wirth said.\\nIn a meeting with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors last week, Mr. Wirth noted many countries continued to buy crude from Russia, one of the top oil producers along with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\\nBut he said that it would be difficult for Russia to overcome the loss of Western technology and capital, noting that other once-large oil producers have seen output fall after sanctions and the pullout of international oil companies.\\n\\\"If you look at Iran and Venezuela, two other examples of large producers that have come under sanctions and have been pretty well cut off from the same kinds of investments and technology, their productive capacity degrades over time,\\\" Mr. Wirth said.\\nAfter decades of carving out footholds in Russia's oil business, BP PLC, Shell PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. said they would exit their operations in the country after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February. A few weeks later, oil-field services giants Halliburton Co., Baker Hughes Co. and Schlumberger Ltd., which provide equipment and workers needed to extract oil, all said they would suspend new investments in Russia.\\nChevron didn't have any sizable operations in Russia and was the least affected major oil company.\\nThe European Union is planning to move forward with a partial embargo of Russian oil, and many Western refiners have stopped buying supplies from Russia. Even so, Mr. Wirth said Russian energy products are still finding willing buyers around the world at discounted prices, and so oil-market participants for now are responding to the prospect of reduced supply, rather than a large drop in oil production. Russian oil is still flowing as some shippers and refiners hide its origins.\\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers aligned with it last week agreed to an increase in production later this summer that was larger than anticipated, which could lead Saudi Arabia to boost output.\\nPresident Biden had earlier called for OPEC to increase production in response to rising energy prices, but the group had rebuffed his requests. The new commitments were seen as a move that could pave the way for Mr. Biden to visit Saudi Arabia later this month, as the U.S. and the kingdom seek to reset what has recently been a strained relationship.\\nMr. Wirth said if Mr. Biden wanted to see global oil supplies rise, Saudi Arabia was among the very few producers with spare capacity to bring more crude to market quickly.\\n\\\"This is the role Saudi has historically played,\\\" Mr. Wirth said. \\\"In the context of the broader relationship and whatever discussions may be ongoing, if that can lead to more supply into the market, that's a positive outcome for world energy markets.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/business-news-chevron-ceo-sees-russian-oil-output/docview/2673506122/se-2?accountid=7064\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Plans' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Plans' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Plans in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Report on Supplemental Schedules The supplemental schedules of assets (held at end of year) as of December 31, 2019 have been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audits of the Plans' financial statements. The supplemental schedules are the responsibility of the Plans' management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the supplemental schedules reconcile to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental schedules. In forming our opinion on the supplemental schedules, we evaluated whether the supplemental schedules, including their form and content, are presented in compliance with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In our opinion, such schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole./s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLPHouston, TexasJune 23, 2020We have served as the auditor of the Plans since 2018.1EIN 36-1812780BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSSTATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITSDECEMBER 31, 2019thousands of dollarsThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.2EIN 36-1812780BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSSTATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITSDECEMBER 31, 2018thousands of dollarsThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.3EIN 36-1812780BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITSYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019thousands of dollarsThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.4BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS1.\\u00a0DESCRIPTION OF THE PLANSThe accompanying financial statements comprise employee savings plans of BP Corporation North America Inc. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) that participate in the BP Master Trust for Employee Savings Plans (the \\u201cMaster Trust\\u201d). The Company is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP p.l.c. (\\u201cBP\\u201d).The following description of the BP Employee Savings Plan, the BP Partnership Savings Plan, the BP DirectSave Plan and the BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan (the \\u201cPlans\\u201d) provides only general information. Participants should refer to the applicable Plan document and Summary Plan Description for additional information. The Plans are subject to and comply with the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\\u201cERISA\\u201d).The purpose of the Plans is to encourage eligible employees to regularly save part of their earnings and to assist them in accumulating additional financial security for their retirement. The Plans provide that both participant contributions and Company matching contributions be held in a trust by an independent trustee for the benefit of participating employees. All plan assets are held in the Master Trust. The trustee of the Master Trust is State Street Bank and Trust Company (\\u201cState Street\\u201d).Fidelity Workplace Services, LLC (\\\"Fidelity\\\") is the recordkeeper for the Plans. The Company is the Plan sponsor and the Company\\u2019s Head of Pensions and Benefits, Americas is the Plan Administrator for the Plans.GeneralBP Employee Savings PlanThe BP Employee Savings Plan (\\u201cESP\\u201d) was established on July 1, 1955. Generally, an employee of the Company (or a participating affiliate) is eligible to participate in ESP immediately upon the date of hire. Employees who are represented by a labor organization that has bargained for and agreed to the provisions of ESP are also eligible.Under ESP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to Internal Revenue Service (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable plan year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. A specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 7 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into ESP representing distributions from other qualified plans.The Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 7 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65).Participants may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $2,017,731 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $199,254 and $68,955, respectively.BP Partnership Savings PlanThe BP Partnership Savings Plan (\\u201cPSP\\u201d) was established on April 1, 1988. Certain salaried employees of the Company who are associated with the Company\\u2019s retail operations and employees of Global Business Services Americas are eligible to participate in PSP immediately upon the date of hire.5BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUnder PSP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable plan year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. A specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 3 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into PSP representing distributions from other qualified plans. The Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 3 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65).Participants may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $21,700 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $1,625 and $132, respectively.BP DirectSave PlanThe BP DirectSave Plan (\\u201cDSP\\u201d) was established on April 1, 1988. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are employees at Company-operated retail locations are eligible to participate in the Plan after six months of service. Currently, there are no active employees contributing to the Plan.Under DSP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions to the participant\\u2019s account equal to $0.50 for each $1.00 of employee contributions up to 4 percent of eligible compensation, as defined under the Plan, each pay period. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into DSP representing distributions from other qualified plans.A participant may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs at 25 percent after two years of vesting service and 100 percent after three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $6,030 was used to pay eligible plan expenses. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $125,735 and $128,893, respectively.BPX Energy Employee Savings PlanThe BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan (\\u201cBPX\\u201d) was established on January 1, 2015. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are working in the BPX Energy unit are eligible to participate in the Plan. Participants were previously eligible to participate in ESP. Account balances may be moved from ESP to BPX at the participant\\u2019s direction. Effective November 1, 2018, the Company\\u2019s Lower 48 business unit changed its name to BPX Energy. Effective the same date, the Plan name was changed to BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan.6BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSUnder BPX, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. A specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 7 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into BPX representing distributions from other qualified plans.The Company will contribute as soon as reasonably possible to the Master Trust a nonelective employer contribution each pay period. The contribution will be allocated to the account of each participant who is an active participant during such pay period. The amount for investment is equal to 7 percent of such participant\\u2019s compensation during such pay period provided, however, that nonelective employer contributions made with respect to a calendar year on behalf of a participant may not exceed the IRS limitations.The Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 7 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65). A participant may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.The benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in the nonelective and Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the  2019 plan year, $388,122 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $38,790 and $2,131, respectively.Investment OptionsInvestment options offered under the Plans include target date funds, equity and fixed-income (bond) index funds, a short-term investment fund, a stable value investment option (\\\"Income Fund\\\") and BP American Depository Shares (\\u201cBP ADS\\u201d) (the BP Stock Fund). The Income Fund invests in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts (\\\"Synthetic Guaranteed Investment Contracts\\\") that simulate the performance of a Guaranteed Investment Contract, whereby participants execute plan transactions at contract value.Participants may change the percentage they contribute and the investment direction of their contributions daily. Company contributions are made in the form of cash contributions and are invested in funds selected by participants. Participants may elect to sell any portion of their investment fund(s) and reinvest the proceeds in one or more of the other available investment alternatives. Except where the fund provider, the recordkeeper, or the Plan has restrictions or takes discretionary action responsive to frequent trading or market timing concerns, there are no restrictions on the number of transactions a participant may authorize during the year.Administrative Expenses/Fund Management FeesFees related to the administration of participant loans and overnight delivery charges are deducted from the applicable participant\\u2019s account. All reasonable and necessary administrative expenses are paid out of the Master Trust or paid by the Company. Generally, fees and expenses related to investment management of each investment option are paid out of the respective funds. As a result, the returns on those investments are net of the investment management fees. The Plans offer a managed accounts service to participants, which is an investment management service provided by Fidelity. Advisory fees related to this service are paid by participants who elect to participate.7BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSPayment of BenefitsParticipants may elect to receive in-service withdrawals subject to various restrictions as described in the applicable Plan document. Upon termination of employment, a participant may elect to receive his or her vested account balance in a lump-sum payment or in installments. A participant may also elect to defer receipt of his or her vested account balance, partially or wholly, to a later date.Notes Receivable from ParticipantsExcept for DSP, participants are eligible to borrow from their account balances in the Plans. Loans are made in the form of cash and the amount may not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the market value of the total vested participant\\u2019s account or $50,000 less the participant\\u2019s highest loan balance outstanding during the preceding 12 months. Interest rates charged on unpaid balances are fixed for the duration of the loan. The interest rate charged is determined by the Plan Administrator based on the prevailing rates charged on similar commercial loans. Repayment of loan principal and interest is generally made by payroll deductions which are credited to the participant\\u2019s account.Plan TerminationAlthough it has not expressed any intention to do so, the Company has the right under the Plans to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the Plans subject to the provisions set forth in ERISA. In the event of a plan termination, participants would become 100 percent vested in their Company matching contribution accounts.2.\\u00a0SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of Accounting. The financial statements of the Plans are prepared under the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d).Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.Payment of Benefits. Benefits are recorded when paid.Transfers. Eligibility requirements differ from Plan to Plan. If a participant becomes eligible for a different plan within the Company\\u2019s control group, the participant is permitted to transfer balances from the old Plan to the new Plan at any time. Plan transfers are accounted for in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits.Excess Contributions Payable. The Plans are required to return contributions received during the Plan year in excess of the Internal Revenue Code (\\u201cIRC\\u201d) limits.New Accounting Pronouncement. In February\\u00a02017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-06, Plan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965): Employee Benefit Plan Master Trust Reporting (\\u201cASU 2017-06\\u201d). ASU 2017-06 clarifies the presentation requirements for a plan\\u2019s interest in a master trust and requires more detailed disclosures of a plan\\u2019s interest in a master trust. ASU 2017-06 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December\\u00a015, 2018, with retrospective application to all periods presented. Management has adopted this new guidance in the current year.In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (\\u201cASU 2018-13\\u201d). ASU 2018-13 eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December\\u00a015, 2019, with retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is permitted. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2018-13.8BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSInvestment Valuation and Income Recognition. All investment assets held by the Master Trust (except for the Income Fund) are stated at fair value. Further information regarding the techniques used to measure the fair value of investment assets held by the Master Trust is detailed in Note 6 (Fair Value Measurements).In connection with the Income Fund, the Master Trust invests in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts also known as Synthetic Guarantee Investment Contracts. See Note 5 (Master Trust). The Synthetic Guaranteed Investment Contracts are measured at contract value. Contract value is the relevant measurement attributable to fully benefit-responsive investment contracts, as contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the Plans.Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation (depreciation) includes the Plan\\u2019s gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held during the year.Notes Receivable from Participants. Notes receivable from participants represent participant loans that are recorded at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on notes receivable from participants is recorded when it is earned. Related fees are recorded as administrative expenses and are expensed when they are incurred. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. If a participant ceases to make loan repayments and the Plan Administrator deems the participant loan to be a distribution, the participant loan balance is reduced and a benefit payment is recorded. 3.\\u00a0FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUSThe Plans have received determination letters from the IRS (dated as shown below) stating that the Plans are qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC and, therefore, the related trust is exempt from taxation.Once qualified, the Plans are required to operate in conformity with the IRC in order to maintain their qualification. During the Plan year, the Plans experienced certain minor operational issues. To ensure the Plans remain qualified, the Plan Administrator is in the process of correcting these minor errors in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS). The Plan Administrator has indicated that it will take the necessary steps, if any, to bring the Plans\\u2019 operations into compliance with the IRC.U.S. GAAP requires plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the Plans. The financial statement effects of a tax position are recognized when the position is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, to be sustained upon examination by the IRS. Plan management has analyzed the tax positions taken by the Plans and has concluded that as of December\\u00a031, 2019, there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken. The Plans have recognized no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Plans are subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions. There are no audits for any tax periods in progress. The Plan Administrator believes the Plans are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2016.4.\\u00a0RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESInvestment securities held in the Master Trust are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market risks and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants\\u2019 account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits. 9BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe 2019 novel coronavirus (or \\u201cCOVID-19\\u201d) has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, the values of investment securities have declined significantly. These economic and market conditions and other effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may continue to adversely affect the Plans. The extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Plans\\u2019 participants\\u2019 account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits cannot be predicted at this time.Included in investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, are shares of BP ADS of $1,025 million and $1,068 million, respectively. This investment represents 12.28 percent and 14.66 percent of total investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A significant decline in the market value of the BP ADS would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.5.\\u00a0MASTER TRUSTThe purpose of the Master Trust is the collective investment of assets of the Plans. Each Plan\\u2019s interest in the Master Trust is based on account balances of the participants and their elected investment options. The Master Trust assets are allocated among the Plans by assigning to each Plan those transactions (primarily contributions, benefit payments and plan-specific expenses) that can be specifically identified and by allocating among all Plans, in proportion to the fair value of the assets assigned to each Plan, income and expenses resulting from the collective investment of the assets of the Master Trust.Investment income and administrative expenses related to the Master Trust are allocated to the individual Plans on a daily basis based on each participant\\u2019s account balance within each investment fund option.Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts. In connection with the Income Fund, the Master Trust enters into contracts that meet fully benefit-responsive investment contract criteria and therefore are reported at contract value. Contract value represents contributions made under each contract, plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and administrative expenses. The Master Trust\\u2019s interest in these contracts represents the maximum potential credit loss from concentrations of credit risk associated with its investment. The contracts provide for the payment of a stated interest crediting rate for a specified period of time. The underlying fixed income assets that support the interest crediting rate are owned by the Master Trust. Under the contracts, investment gains and losses on the underlying assets are not reflected immediately in the interest crediting rate. Rather, the gains and losses are amortized, usually over time to maturity or the duration of the underlying assets, through adjustments to future interest crediting rates. These adjustments generally result in contract value, over time, converging with the market value of the underlying fixed income assets. Factors affecting future interest crediting rates include the current yield, duration and the existing difference between market value of the underlying fixed income assets and contract value. Interest crediting rates, which cannot be less than zero percent, are generally reset monthly. The issuers of the contracts guarantee that all qualified participant withdrawals occur at contract value, subject to certain limitations described below.Contract termination occurs whenever the contract value or market value of the underlying assets reaches zero or upon certain events of default. If the contract terminates due to a contract issuer default or if the market value of the underlying portfolio reaches zero, the contract issuer will generally be required to pay any excess contract value at the date of termination. If the Plans default in their obligation under the agreements and the default is not cured within the time permitted, the Plans will receive the market value as of the date of termination. Contract termination also may occur by either party upon election and notice.10BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCertain events may limit the ability of the Plans to transact at contract value with an issuer. Such events include (i) amendments to Plan documents or the Plans\\u2019 administration (including complete or partial plan termination or merger with another plan); (ii) changes to the Plans\\u2019 prohibition on competing investment options or deletion of equity wash provisions; (iii) the failure of the Plans or the Master Trust to qualify for exemption from federal income taxes or any required prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA; (iv) bankruptcy of the Plan sponsor or other Plan sponsor event (for example, divestitures or spin-offs of a subsidiary) that cause a significant withdrawal from the Plans; and (v) the delivery of any communication to plan participants designed to influence a participant\\u2019s behavior in the investment option. At this time, management does not believe that the occurrence of any such event, which would limit the Plans\\u2019 ability to transact at contract value with participants, is probable.In addition, certain events allow the issuer to terminate the contracts with the Plans and settle at an amount different from contract value. Those events may be different under each contract. Such events may include (i) an uncured violation of the Plans\\u2019 investment guidelines; (ii) a breach of material obligation under the contract; (iii) a material misrepresentation; and (iv) a material amendment to the agreements without the consent of the issuer.Plans\\u2019 Interest in Master Trust. The Plans have a divided interest in the investments held in the Master Trust since each Plan\\u2019s interest is based on the account balances of the participants and their elected investment options. Each Plan\\u2019s beneficial interest in the underlying investment options does not vary significantly from each Plan\\u2019s beneficial interest in the total net assets of the Master Trust.The net assets of the Master Trust and the Plans' interest in the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2019, are as follows:11BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe net assets of the Master Trust and the Plans' interest in the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2018, are as follows:12BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe changes in net assets of the Master Trust for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2019, are as follows:6.\\u00a0FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below.Level 1 inputs are observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.Level 2 inputs are observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable at the reporting date.13BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data, and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management\\u2019s best estimate of fair value.In measuring fair value, the Plans and the Master Trust use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The valuation techniques used by the Plans and Master Trust are summarized as follows:BP Stock Fund. A unitized stock fund operates similarly to a mutual fund, in that they are composed of stock, and a small percentage of cash or another short-term interest-bearing vehicle. The inclusion of cash provides liquid assets to allow for the daily processing of transfers, loans, and withdrawals. The value of a unit in a unitized stock fund is based on the Net Asset Value (\\u201cNAV\\u201d), which is the value of the underlying BP ADS and the cash vehicle held by the fund, less any fees, divided by the number of units outstanding. Therefore, the NAV of the fund (the \\u201cunit price\\u201d) will be different from the closing price of the underlying stock on the applicable exchange. The individual assets of a stock fund are generally considered separately as individual investments for accounting and financial statement reporting purposes and have been reported in this manner as BP ADS and Short Term Investment Fund.Common/Collective Trust Funds. Common/collective trust funds are valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. Money Market Fund. The money market fund is valued at fair value using published market prices.The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Plans and Master Trust believe their valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.The following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of the investments held by the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2019 (in thousands):14BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of the investments held by the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2018 (in thousands):(a)Short-term investment funds invest in short-term fixed-income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high quality. Under normal circumstances, there are no redemption restrictions; redemptions can be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require 15 days prior written notice for the short-term investment fund.(b)Equity common/collective trust funds seek to maintain portfolio diversification and approximate the risk and return characterized by certain equity indices. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 3 to 15 days.(c)U.S. bond common/collective trust funds seek to maintain an overall diversified portfolio whose investment return matches the performance of certain bond indices. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.(d)Non-U.S. bond common/collective trust funds seek to provide investment returns of a diversified portfolio of international government bonds and match the performance of an index. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.(e)Target date common/collective trust funds are pre-mixed portfolios of diversified assets (stocks, bonds and other investments). They are designed for participants who expect to retire in or close to the target year stated in each option\\u2019s name. With the exception of the Target Date Retirement Fund, over time, the portfolio mix of each fund will gradually shift to more fixed income securities as the target year approaches. Upon reaching the target year, the fund will be blended into the Target Date Retirement Fund, which is designed to provide those participants who are withdrawing money from the Plan with an appropriate blend of growth, income and inflation protection. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 3 days.(f)Other common/collective trust funds seek to offer a diversified exposure to inflation-sensitive securities including U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (\\u201cTIPS\\u201d), commodities and global real estate to help hedge against inflation. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.15BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe above provides a general description of the investments. Participants should refer to the Investment Options Guide for information on the investment objectives and strategy of each investment option.Transfers between Levels. The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.The significance of transfers between levels is evaluated based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between levels.7.\\u00a0RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND EXEMPT PARTY-IN-INTEREST TRANSACTIONSCertain of the Master Trust investments are managed by the investment division of State Street and by Fidelity Management and Research Company, an affiliate of the Plans\\u2019 recordkeeper. The BP Stock Fund holds investments in BP ADS. Purchases and sales of BP ADS during 2019 amounted to $270 million and $310 million, respectively. These transactions qualify as exempt party-in-interest transactions under ERISA. The BP ADS held within the BP Stock Fund earned dividends of $67 million for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2019.The Plans also issue loans to participants, which are secured by the vested balances in the participants' accounts.8.\\u00a0RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO FORM 5500The following is a reconciliation of the Plans\\u2019 net assets available for benefits per the financial statements to the Form 5500 (in thousands):16BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following is a reconciliation of the Plans\\u2019 net increase in net assets per the financial statements to the net income per the Form 5500 (in thousands):The following is a reconciliation of benefits paid to participants per the financial statements to the Form 5500 (in thousands):9.\\u00a0SUBSEQUENT EVENTSSubsequent to December\\u00a031, 2019, COVID-19 has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the macro-economic environment and global economy. Due to the disruption of the virus on the global economy, the values of investment securities have declined significantly and may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, subsequent to the Plans\\u2019 year end, oil prices have declined significantly, which has also negatively impacted the BP ADS share price.While the COVID-19 outbreak and depressed oil prices have negatively impacted global financial markets, and specifically the BP ADS share price, the Company does not believe there is substantial doubt about the Plans\\u2019 ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes the Plan Administrator could continue to carry on the administrative functions of the Plans for at least the period of one year from the date of this report.On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress. The CARES Act provides immediate and temporary relief for retirement plan sponsors and their participants respective to employer contributions, distributions and participant loans. Utilization of the provisions included within the CARES Act are optional and may be effective and operationalized immediately, prior to amending the plan document. The Plans have implemented certain distribution and loan relief provisions and management intends to amend the Plans timely.17BP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANSSchedule H, Line 4i \\u2013 Schedule of Assets (Held at End of Year)December\\u00a031, 2019* Indicates party-in-interest.18SIGNATUREPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the trustees (or other persons who administer the respective employee benefit plans) have duly caused this annual report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.19EXHIBIT INDEX20\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000313807/000031380720000008/a2019form11-k.htm\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's\\nFirst Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is\\nbeing recorded.\\nI will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron\\nCorporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\\nJake Robert Spiering\\nDirector\\nThank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm\\nJake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO,\\nEimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are\\navailable on Chevron's website.\\nBefore we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other\\nforward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this\\npresentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.\\nNow I'll turn it over to Mike.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nThanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron continues to deliver strong\\noperational performance, maintain cost and capital discipline and consistently return cash to shareholders.\\nFirst quarter marked 9 consecutive quarters with adjusted earnings over $5 billion and adjusted ROCE\\nabove 12%.\\nDuring the quarter, we also returned $6 billion in cash to shareholders, the eighth straight quarter over\\n$5 billion. We also grew production more than 10% from the same quarter last year and announced final\\ninvestment decisions to grow our renewable fuels and hydrogen businesses.\\nEarlier this month, we announced our third Future Energy Fund focused on venture investments in lower-\\ncarbon technologies. The merger with Hess is advancing, and we intend to certify substantial compliance\\nwith the FTC second request in the coming weeks. We believe that a preemption right does not apply to\\nthis transaction and are confident this will be affirmed in arbitration. We expect the proxy for the Hess\\nshareholder vote to be mailed in April with a special meeting date in late May. This strategic combination\\ncreates a premier energy company with world-class capabilities and assets to deliver superior shareholder\\nvalue, and we look forward to bringing the 2 companies together.\\nAt TCO, we had achieved start-up of WPMP this month with the first inlet separator and pressure boost\\ncompressor in service and conversion of the first metering station to low pressure now complete. Later\\nthis quarter, we expect a second pressure boost compressor online and a third gas turbine generator to\\nprovide power to the Tengiz grid. Metering station conversions are planned through the remainder of the\\nyear as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned\\nSGI and KTL turnarounds.\\nWe continue to make significant progress on FGP and expect to have additional major equipment ready\\nfor operations in the third quarter. Costs and scheduled guidance remain unchanged with FGP expected to\\nstart up in the first half of 2025.\\nNow over to Eimear to discuss the financials.\\nEimear P. Bonner\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nVP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center\\nThanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong earnings, ROCE and cash returns to shareholders.\\nWe reported first quarter earnings of $5.5 billion or $2.97 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.4 billion\\nor $2.93 per share. Cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximate $300 million international\\nupstream ARO settlement payment and $200 million for the expansion of the retail marketing network. We\\nalso had a working capital build during the quarter consistent with historical trends.\\nChevron delivered on all of its financial priorities during the quarter, an 8% increase in dividend per share;\\norganic CapEx aligned with ratable budget inclusive of progress payments for new LNG ships; sustained\\nnet debt in the single digits while issuing commercial paper to manage timing of affiliate dividends and\\nworking capital; and share repurchases of $3 billion.\\nAdjusted earnings were lower by $1 billion versus last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings were down due\\nto lower realization and liquids liftings. Partly offsetting were favorable tax impacts. Adjusted downstream\\nearnings were lower mainly due to timing effects associated with the rising commodity price environment.\\nAll other decreased on higher employee costs and an unfavorable swing in tax items.\\nAdjusted first quarter earnings were down $1.3 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were\\ndown modestly. Higher liftings were more than offset by lower natural gas realizations. DD&A was higher\\ndue to the PDC acquisition and Permian growth. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to\\nlower refining margins and timing effects.\\nWorldwide oil equivalent production was the highest first quarter in our company's history. Production\\nwas up over 12% from last year, including an increase of 35% in the United States largely due to the PDC\\nEnergy acquisition and organic growth in the Permian Basin.\\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we have planned turnarounds at TCO and several Gulf of Mexico\\nassets. Following another strong quarter in the Permian, production is trending better than our previous\\nguidance, and we now expect first half production to be down less than 2% from the fourth quarter.\\nImpacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo and Richmond. We anticipate higher\\naffiliate dividends in the second quarter largely from TCO. With the start-up of WPMP, we expect TCO's\\nDD&A to increase by approximately $400 million over the remainder of the year.\\nShare repurchases are restricted under SEC regulations through the Hess shareholder vote, after which\\nwe intend to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate. We've published a new document with our\\nconsolidated guidance and sensitivities that will be updated quarterly and posted to our website the month\\nprior to our earnings call.\\nBack to you, Jake.\\nJake Robert Spiering\\nDirector\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]\\nWe will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the line.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

And specifically, the effects of the\\nWPMP start-up, if you don't mind going into some detail. I think the market understands that it's FGP\\nphase that really rerates kind of TCO's distribution capacity. But if there's any incremental benefits from\\nWPMP starting up, whether it's reliability or potential to produce over nameplate or even just the CapEx\\nrun rate and what it means for maybe an annualized TCO distribution at this stage, that would be very\\nhelpful.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Sam, let me talk a little bit to the project and operational dimensions of this, and then I'll let Eimear\\ncomment on the financial ramifications of that. So look, we're really pleased with the progress that's been\\nmaking and pleased that we've begun the initial start-up of WPMP with the first PBF compressor online and\\nprocessing crude through the plants after conversion of the first metering station.\\nIt's an important milestone. I'm proud of the team and the work they've been doing. They've done\\nthis safely. We're seeing initial operation that is well aligned with our expectations. In fact, we've been\\nencouraged by very strong production response from the wells that feed into this first metering station.\\nWe now have the second metering station planned for conversion as off-line, and that conversion is\\nunderway. And as we bring on more of the PBF compression capacity, we'll complete more metering\\nstations over the balance of the year.\\nWhat happens here is we get higher production because the wells are now flowing against lower back\\npressure. And as I said, Sam, we've seen really strong response on this first set of wells. What that does\\nis it gives us a high degree of confidence in keeping the plants full all year long with the fact being that\\nwe've got some turnarounds we have to do. We've got an SGI turnaround and a KTL turnaround, SGI this\\nquarter, KTL next quarter, to do some tie-ins and some other normal maintenance. But in the periods in\\nbetween those, it increases deliverability and the confidence of the plant will be full throughout that period\\nof time.\\nWe've got a lot of project scope operational is the other thing that I just would remind you of. We're\\nproducing from new wells. We've got upgraded to new utilities now, gathering system, a new control\\ncenter, power distribution system, 2 new, big-frame 9 gas turbine generators in service. So the reliability\\nof the infrastructure and all of the control networks and everything is significantly improved as we got\\nmore modern equipment in place. So all of this reads through to higher degree of reliability, strong\\nproduction performance.\\nAnd last year was the second strongest year in the past several. So it gives us high confidence in\\ndelivering what we've said we'll deliver there. And then as we get into the third quarter, we'll start\\ncommissioning some of the process equipment as part of FGP, which, as you say, first half start-up next\\nyear is when you see the incremental production come online.\\nSo good progress all the way around. I'll reiterate that schedule and cost guidance are unchanged. And\\nwe'll continue to provide details each quarter on milestones and progress as we proceed.\\nEimear, maybe you can just talk about what that means financially.\\nEimear P. Bonner\\nVP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nYes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Sam, well, after years of investing, as the project starts up over the next couple of\\nyears, we do expect the CapEx profile to continue to decline, and that will enable free cash flow over the\\nnext couple of years to grow.\\nWith WPMP, it will keep the plants full. So this will allow IBS business to generate significant cash, and\\nthat will be available for distribution. With the second phase of the project then next year in '25, TCOs\\nfree cash flow is going to grow even further because with that phase of the project, we get incremental\\nproduction.\\nSo what does this mean for Chevron? Well, we expect $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion in\\n2026. This is a $60 Brent. This will flow to us through a combination of dividends, so you'll see this come\\nthrough cash flow from operations and loan repayments, which will flow through cash for investing.\\nSo we do expect dividends this year. We have guidance -- affiliate guidance to dividends for 2024. But\\nwe've also included in the deck today the outlook for affiliate dividends for the second quarter, $1 billion to\\n$1.5 billion. And a significant portion of that is an assumption around TCO.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\\nNeil Singhvi Mehta\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nMy question is really on the exploration program. Specifically, you have an interesting position in West\\nAfrica and Namibia. So maybe you can just give us some historical context of how you got involved here.\\nIs this an asset that you see a lot of opportunity in, especially given some of the announcements from\\npeers over the last couple of weeks? And how do you think about prosecuting it going forward?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Thank you, Neil. We've got a nice portfolio of exploration opportunities around the world and including\\nnumerous prospects on Block 90 in the Orange Basin offshore Namibia, which lies just outshore --\\noutbound of where there was a recent discovery announced by another company. We're planning to spud\\nthe first exploration well in that block late this year or early next year based on rig availability. The rig will\\nbe completed in early '25.\\nWe farmed into another block, Block 82, which is further north in the Walvis space, and that was just\\nannounced earlier this week. And as you know, there have been a number of discoveries made by\\ncompanies in the Orange Basin. Our block is on trend with those discoveries. We're encouraged by the\\nsuccess we see from others. And this is certainly an area where the industry has had a high -- a good\\nbatting average, a high degree of success. And we're pleased that we've got 2 blocks now offshore\\nNamibia. And of course, we'll talk to you more as we get into the exploration program there.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\\nPaul Cheng\\nScotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division\\nYou guys did a small deal look like on the retail marketing asset, adding over 200 stations in the Gulf\\nCoast and West Coast. I actually don't remember. I think since you've become the head of downstream,\\nsay, call it, 20 years ago, you guys have been selling asset there. So is there a change of your view in\\nterms of the overall strategy we made to that part of the business? And whether that -- this deal you are\\ngoing to be owning the asset or that this is wholesale marketing [ drop ] network type of deal that you are\\nacquiring?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nYes. Thank you, Paul. As you know, I come out of that part of the business. I love talking about retail.\\nLook, we've got 3 really strong brands around the world. Caltex internationally; in Asia, primarily; in\\nMiddle East and Africa, a little bit. Chevron and Texaco here primarily in the Americas.\\nAnd you're right, we only own about 5% in the U.S., even less than 5% of our branded stations. So most\\nof our business is done through large retailers and distributors. We enter into agreements of supply\\nagreements and brand agreements with these marketers. And there are times, different mechanisms,\\nwe use to support their investments. We've done a couple of deals here in the last quarter that are\\nsubstantial, that add a few hundred stations to our network. And as part of that, we advanced some cash\\nto support their brand conversion efforts, their investment in the network and to solidify our relationship\\nwith really important customers of ours that ultimately sell on to consumers. And so you saw that\\nconsume some cash.\\nIt technically from an accounting standpoint doesn't get classified as capital, but we want to disclose it\\nbecause it is cash. And it helps us grow our branded sales. And so it's an important part of our business.\\nWe're doing these kinds of deals all the time, Paul. They tend to be oftentimes smaller magnitude, so they\\ndon't necessarily get to a size where we would mention it the way that we did today. But we won't own\\nthese stations. They're owned by really strong independent retailers. Thanks for the question.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Betty Jiang with Barclays.\\nWei Jiang\\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\\nMike, just -- so we're seeing that the U.S. operations look pretty strong quarter, especially with Permian\\nholding in better than expected relative to your expectations. Could you just talk about what drove the\\nbetter performance in the Permian and how you think the rest of the year unfolds? And then just anything\\nelse within the U.S. that you want to highlight?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nSure. So yes, first quarter production in the Permian was good, 859,000 barrels a day, down about\\n1% from the fourth quarter of last year, stronger than what we had anticipated. Really good, strong\\nperformance in our company-operated business, building off the momentum from the fourth quarter of\\nlast year. We have seen reliability improvements that translate into a slightly less decline in our base\\nproduction.\\nWe saw a significantly shorter frac to POP cycle time, so between completed frac and when we put it on\\nproduction. So that resulted in a few more wells being POP-ed in the first quarter, which you see in the\\nproduction. Well performance itself was generally aligned with our expectations. And so we've been talking\\na lot about type curves the last few quarters. We're seeing strong performance that's aligned with or even\\na little bit stronger than what we expected.\\nAnd then we also saw some good contributions from our royalty acreage, which is the highest-return\\nbarrels we have because we really have no investment there and it's attractive acreage. Others are\\ndeveloping it. And we saw increased activity that resulted in increased royalty production.\\nNOJV, right on plan with what we expected and a lot of visibility into the non-operated joint venture\\nportfolio for this year, more even than last year at this time, and confidence that, that will deliver. So all of\\nthat translated into a very strong first quarter.\\nEimear mentioned that we now expect our first half to be better than we'd previously guided. We said 2%\\nto 4% down versus fourth quarter of last year. We now think we'll be less than 2% down. And then, of\\ncourse, the back half of the year, we had another frac spread. We've got more wells online and expect to\\nexit the year around 900,000 barrels a day. So really strong performance there and consistent with the\\nmomentum that you've seen in prior quarters.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nThe -- I guess the other thing I would mention relative to the U.S. more broadly is the Anchor project in\\nthe deepwater Gulf of Mexico is we've guided towards midyear start-up of that. It's right on track. The\\nfloating production unit is being commissioned. As we speak, we've got both buyback gas and back oil\\nin the facilities. So that means the pipelines, the process units are now charged with live hydrocarbons.\\nWe're commissioning some of the subsea infrastructure, including flow lines.\\nThe completion of the first well is in progress. Second well is drilled and will be completed shortly. Third\\nwell is being drilled right now. So we'll talk more about this, but everything is right on track for start-up\\nof Anchor midyear. And then, of course, we've got other Gulf of Mexico projects as well that are kind of\\nstacked up right behind Anchor over subsequent quarters. So the outlook in the U.S. is especially strong.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.\\nJoshua Ian Silverstein\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nYou had around $1 billion of debt this quarter to manage some of the working capital and really\\ndistribution timing. Do you see the cash balance growing sequentially? Did you repay the commercial\\npaper in 2Q? Just wanted to get a sense of where the cash outlook may go sequentially.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nEimear, why don't you take that?\\nEimear P. Bonner\\nVP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center\\nYes. Josh, yes, so we had some commercial paper issued in the first quarter, and it was just to manage\\nshort-term liquidity. Timing of affiliate dividends can be a bit lumpy, repatriation of cash can be a bit\\nlumpy. So this was normal business for us in the first quarter.\\nI think in terms of what to expect in terms of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, we target to hold about\\n$5 billion in cash, and that will bounce around as well. But I think $5 billion is a good number. We have\\naccess to lots of liquidity and commercial paper, bond investors, credit facilities. So while we've had higher\\ncash in the balance sheet in the past, holding excess cash with low debt and lots of access to liquidity can\\nbe a drag in returns. So we're quite comfortable with the $5 billion cash, and that's a good number for you\\nto focus on there.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.\\nBiraj Borkhataria\\nRBC Capital Markets, Research Division\\nI wanted to ask a follow-up on the Permian. So you put out there the updated well productivity slide,\\nwhich is very helpful. But a few quarters ago, Mike, you talked about some of the broader constraints in\\nthe Permian, whether it's CO2, water handling and so on. It doesn't look like it's impacted your volumes in\\nthe near term, which have performed very well. So could you just refresh us on if anything has changed in\\nyour views on that there?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Thanks, Biraj. Nothing's really changed. I mean this is a very large base business now with thousands\\nof wells over a very large footprint. And it's important that we focus not only on productivity, efficiency\\nand reliability and drilling and completions, but also in all aspects of operations. And that's midstream\\ntakeaway, it's gas processing, it's water handling.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nAnd we've got more development underway this year in the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, which is\\ngoing to require a build-out of some of this capability, which will be part of our capital program addresses.\\nBut you really have to stay on top of base business reliability on all these things. Seismic is another one\\nwe've seen some issues on.\\nAnd so they're all part of managing the business for safety and reliability each and every day. We had a\\nquarter -- a couple of quarters back where a number of those things were a challenge. And the current\\nquarter, we saw really good performance.\\nLast thing I might mention, which might be implied in your question, you see some talk about the\\ntakeaway capacity out of the basin and are people constrained, is that impacting particularly gas prices\\nwithin the other commodities. We're covered on takeaway capacity out of the basin on oil, NGL and gas\\nwell out into the future. And so we're not exposed to any in-basin discounted pricing as a result of that.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\\nNitin Kumar\\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\\nMike, I just wanted to maybe get an update on Venezuela. There were some reports that Biden\\nadministration is reinstating some of the export bans on that country. Specifically said that Chevron was\\nnot included, but just your thoughts on sort of the future of oil production and exports from the country\\nand how it would impact Chevron?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Thanks, Nitin. So you might recall that the Department of Treasury and OPEC, a division within\\ntreasury, has issued a couple of different, what are called general licenses for operations for companies in\\nVenezuela. There's one called General License 41, which primarily pertains to our position in the country.\\nThere's some specific licenses as well that kind of go along with that. And then there had been a second\\none that was issued subsequently called General License 44, which applied more broadly. That's the one\\nwhere the administration has announced some changes. And those don't really impact us. There have\\nbeen no changes to GL 41. And so we're not really affected by the news you've read about recently.\\nI'll just remind you, we're not putting new capital into Venezuela right now. All the spending is really self-\\nfunded from the cash from operations. We've been lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S., which has been\\nhelpful for the U.S. refining system, not just ours but others as well.\\nAnd since that license was issued now a little bit more than a year ago, we've seen production at the\\njoint ventures that we're participating in increase from about 120,000 barrels a day at the time that, that\\nlicense was issued to about 180,000 barrels a day now. So that's an update. There are some -- maybe it\\nmight be worth reminding just how the financial side of that works because it's a little bit different than\\nsome of the other parts of our production. So Eimear, do you want to touch on that?\\nEimear P. Bonner\\nVP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center\\nYes. Nitin, just as a reminder, for Venezuela, we do cost accounting, not equity accounting. So Chevron\\nis not recording the production here or the reserves. We record earnings when we receive cash, and that\\nshows up under other income and income statement. Just to put this into context, in 2023, the cash was\\nmodest, probably less than 2% cash flow from operations.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\\nJason Daniel Gabelman\\nTD Cowen, Research Division\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

I know when the Hess deal was announced, you discussed\\n$10 billion to $15 billion. But given that's in a bit of a holding pattern here, I'm just wondering what you\\nexpect the cadence or the target for divestments to be. I think historically, you've done about $2 billion a\\nyear. So that's not too far from what the guidance was with the Hess deal. Just trying to try and lay those\\n2 numbers and getting a sense of what the divestment program could look like while that deal is in a bit\\nof a holding pattern. If you could just remind us the assets that have been discussed in the market, that\\nwould be great.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Yes, sure. Happy to do that, Jason. So the first thing is you're right. We're always high-grading our\\nportfolio. And it's not because we need the cash. You already covered the strength of the balance sheet.\\nBut it's really to set value to optimize our portfolio. We find times there are things that don't compete for\\ncapital in our portfolio and they fit better with somebody else.\\nThey tend to be early-in-life assets. We were at Rosebank and divested that a few years ago or things that\\nare much later in life and might fit better with somebody who works those kinds of assets.\\nOver the last decade or so, 2012 through 2023, we divested about $35 billion worth. Our long-term\\nhistory has been about $2 billion per year, maybe 1% of our capital employed, give or take. And our\\nguidance for this year is 1% to 2%, so it's pretty consistent with history. We did say that upon the closure\\nof the Hess transaction, we're going to add some assets that are going to be highly attractive for capital\\ninvestment. And that means as you look through the rest of the portfolio, if we stay capital-disciplined,\\nthere are probably some things that we might otherwise have invested in that now we would choose not\\nto. And so that's where the 10 to 15 guidance came from. That would still stand upon closure.\\nThe things we're doing now are things we would have done in the normal course. And so they're not really\\nrelated to high-grading post the Hess addition. The things that are in the public domain, we talked about\\nMyanmar, which we exited as of April 1. We've announced that we intend to exit the Congo, and we've got\\na deal there. We expect that to close before the end of the year.\\nWe have talked about our position in unconventionals in Canada and in Kaybob, Duvernay, which is a nice\\nasset, which has some growth opportunities, but it may be a better fit for others. So we're looking at\\nalternatives there. And then also the Haynesville, we paused our development activity in the Haynesville\\nlast year, and that's another one that we think may fit better with others. So I think those are the ones\\nthat are out in the public right now, Jason.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\\nRobert Alan Brackett\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nGiven the launch of Future Energy Fund III, can you give us a thought of what you saw success cases\\ncoming out of I and II that caused you to move to III? And maybe compare and contrast how you do it\\nyourself in-house solar to hydrogen, for example, versus where you might see third parties to try new\\ntechnologies.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So I appreciate that. This is one that we probably haven't talked about with investors as much as\\nsome of the other parts of our business. Funds 1 and 2 were smaller, $100 million, $300 million. And\\nthey're not actually fully subscribed yet, but they're getting there, which is why we announced fund #3.\\nWe've been in the venture investing business for 1/4 of a century, so going back to the late '90s when we\\nfirst set up our venture investing organization.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We're collaborating with 250 or\\nso other co-investors in these companies. We can serve as a pilot bed for their technology so we can help\\nthem bring things from the lab and kind of bench scale out into the real world.\\nAnd I've visited last year, one of our carbon capture pilots in the San Joaquin Valley with a company\\nthat's got some really interesting technology to help us improve the efficiency, reduce the cost for carbon\\ncapture. And so we're looking at things like industrial decarbonization, hydrogen, emerging mobility,\\nenergy decentralization, the circular carbon economy. And what we're really looking to do is support\\ninnovation in things that we probably aren't doing within the company, within our own R&D or scale up. As\\nyou mentioned, the projects in the Permian Basin or in the San Joaquin Valley, the solar to green hydrogen\\nis using established technologies that are well proven.\\nWhat we're doing in our venture investing is trying to develop these new technologies, new materials, new\\nnovel ways to integrate AI and other kinds of technology systems to help solve some of these problems.\\nAnd hopefully, we find things that will help our business and help the world.\\nLast thing I'll say is over the 25 years, we've more than earned our money back in our return on our\\ninvestment. Not every one of these companies is successful, but we've seen a lot of technologies move\\ninto our business. We've seen a lot of the companies become successful. And there's a lot of innovation\\ngoing on out there. This allows us to leverage ourselves into smaller start-up innovation that we might not\\notherwise see. So it's been a very, very positive for us, and we're excited to announce the new fund.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\\nRoger David Read\\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nCan we talk a little bit about Eastern Med? I know at one point, operations shut down. It sounds like\\neverything is back up and running. But also you would kind of tie that into Egypt a little bit, where there's\\nbeen some exploration talk and in the government trying to do some things to improve the overall\\ninvestment, I guess, environment there.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes, you bet. So first of all, we are back in full operations in the Eastern Med. We've -- Tamar was down\\nfor about a month at the very beginning of hostilities. But we're excited about the opportunities there.\\nJust to remind you, we've got the 2 existing platforms, Tamar and Leviathan, in service. And we've really\\nstructured our development plans there to focus on capital efficiency, higher returns, to the earlier answer,\\nthings we've got to compete for capital in our portfolio.\\nSince we've closed on the Noble acquisition, we've increased production at Tamar and Leviathan by more\\nthan 10% just through debottlenecking and reliability. We've sanctioned projects at both of those that\\nare currently in progress that will increase production by another 40% over the next couple of years. And\\nwe're looking at larger expansion, particularly for Leviathan, where we've got a number of concepts that\\nare being evaluated. Obviously, in the current environment, we're moving carefully with development of\\nthose.\\nYou mentioned Egypt. We've got a discovery at Argus. We expect another appraisal well there in late\\nthis year or early next year to better characterize the field and refine our development plan. We've got a\\nnumber of other blocks that have not been drilled yet that we shot a seismic on. And we plan to spud a\\nwell in Block 4 there before the end of this year. And so it's an area that I think has got real prospectivity.\\nAs you look at growth in both the near term, with the projects I mentioned and then the longer expansion\\nof existing and exploration prospectivity, it's a part of our portfolio that I expect us to see growth from\\nover the coming decade.\\nOperator\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

We talked about the Permian productivity, which looks\\nreally good. But could you just touch on the DJ? And that production looks stronger than we expected.\\nAnd then also any political risk you might want to comment on that there?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nSure. So yes, first quarter production in the DJ was above 400,000 barrels a day, kind of higher than what\\nour long-term guidance is. We had timing -- a lot of fourth quarter '23 wells put on production there. You'd\\ntypically expect some weather-related downtime in Colorado over the first quarter. We saw some of that,\\nbut less than what we had planned for. So production was good.\\nSecond quarter, there's maybe some minimal impacts that we expect from a third-party gas plant that's\\nhad an outage. But continued strong performance there thus far in the second quarter. These are high\\ncash margin, low-breakeven barrels that we're really pleased to have in our portfolio. If you go back 3\\nyears ago, we didn't have anything in DJ. We were not talking 400,000 barrels a day of production there.\\nWe plan to hold our plateau there around 400,000 barrels a day, and it will fluctuate a little bit based on\\nthe timing of bringing new pads on and completion of wells, et cetera. But it's a really strong asset for us.\\nLet me talk about the politics and kind of the operating environment a little bit, and then maybe I'll have\\nEimear just touch on PDC and the benefits of that. But Colorado is a state where energy is an important\\npart of the economy. And I grew up there. The environment is very important to the people and the\\nstate as well. And I think their goal has been to be a leader in responsible development and to recognize\\nthe important economic contribution that our industry makes to the states. I'm confident that, that will\\ncontinue to be the case.\\nWe've got good relationships with members of the legislature, with the executive branch, with the\\ngovernor. And as the largest oil and gas producer in the state with over 1,000 employees who live and\\nwork there and we were a significant investor there, we engage broadly within the community. And I think\\nthere's a recognition that responsible development in Colorado is what everybody wants and what we are\\ncommitted to.\\nAnd there's -- can be some noise around ballot proposals. There can be some noise around legislative\\nproposals. But we're confident that the state is interested in working with us to be a responsible player\\nand for this to be an important part of the economy. Eimear, maybe PDC, some of the benefits, just so\\npeople are reminded of that.\\nEimear P. Bonner\\nVP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center\\nYes. It's been about 9 months since we closed with PDC Energy. We're really pleased with the progress\\nthat we're seeing, the synergies. On the CapEx side, to date, we've captured $500 million, which is $100\\nmillion more than what we had initially guided to. We're also seeing capture on the OpEx side as well. So\\nwe're nearing $100 million there.\\nThe teams are continuing to integrate. We're bringing the best of both companies together and building\\na development playbook focused on optimizing returns in the basin. We're realizing strong free cash flow\\nfrom these assets. So we're ahead of pace for the incremental $1 billion in annual free cash flow that we\\nguided to.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\\nDevin J.

And Mike, I think you've talked in the past about how there is some\\nsimilarity in the design between [ WPMP ] and FGP as a result of that. As you bring WPMP online, it\\nhelps derisk part of the FGP ramp as well. I was wondering if you could remind us what some of that\\ncommonality is. And as you look at the milestones you look out over the next few months at WPMP, which\\nare the ones that you think about as being key to help derisk FGP as well?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So it's -- just to remind everybody, this is a massive field. Some of you have visited it. And FGP, the\\nFuture Growth Project, is taking things we did almost 20 years ago now with the second generation plant\\nin sour gas injection, where we injected about half of the sour gas. And we're now injecting all the sour\\ngas, increasing production. And at the same time, we're reducing back pressure on the field and using\\ncompression to push the production into the facilities so that we're not relying on field pressure to do that.\\nAnd that increases the life and longevity of the production out of the field.\\nThe other thing this project brings with it is what I've described sometimes as urban renewal. And it takes\\ninfrastructure that was built back even before Kazakhstan was independent. And it brings power and utility\\ninfrastructure, control infrastructure up to modern-day technology and modern-day standards. So the\\nprojects are quite integrated.\\nThe start-up sequencing in terms of what you do to walk down systems, ensure they're ready for\\noperation, do all the testing and start-up is very similar, whether you're in one portion of the project or\\nanother. And the productivity of the field resources that we see on WPMP reads across to FGP as well.\\nAnd so while they're fundamentally different project scopes and objectives, so much of the work is similar\\nacross equipment and the commissioning and start-up activities that I think the positive progress we're\\nmaking, the success we're seeing in commissioning and start-up at FGP reads straight -- at WPMP, reads\\nstraight across to FGP as well.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.\\nRyan M. Todd\\nPiper Sandler & Co., Research Division\\nMaybe one on the renewable side of your portfolio. I mean you announced FIDs on a couple of different\\nrenewable projects, one in biofuels, one in solar to hydrogen. Can you provide some color on what\\nunderpins confidence in these specific projects, whether it's commercial or technical or regulatory support?\\nAnd do you see further opportunities to develop similar projects in the portfolio going forward? Or are\\nthere specific things about these ones in particular that make them attractive?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So the 2 projects. One is an oilseed processing plant in our joint venture with Bunge. It's a project at\\nDestrehan, Louisiana. And so FID was announced for a new oilseed processing plant there. This one will\\nfeature a very flexible design, and that's important because it gives you feedstock flexibility, which matters\\nin any fuels manufacturing business. So in this case, we can process soybeans and softseeds, but we can\\nalso be able to process winter oilseed crops, things like winter canola, cover crest. And so it gives us a\\ngreater range of potential feedstocks that can then feed into our renewable fuels business, particularly\\nthe Geismar real diesel project, which will start up later this year. And it's really important that we have\\nexposure across these value chains.\\nThe margins can move from the crush margin into the upgrading margin or what you consider the refining\\nmargin, into the marketing margin. And just like in our traditional business, being able to catch all margin\\nacross the value chain as it moves is important. Having flexibility, scale and reliability are important. So all\\nof those underpin the investment decision there.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024\\nThe project in California on green hydrogen is smaller in scale. And it really uses existing solar production\\ncapacity. We've got a 5-megawatt production facility in our Lost Hills oilfield in Kern County. And we're\\ngoing to produce about a metric ton per day of hydrogen for retail fuel stations. So we're using existing\\ninfrastructure. We're integrating into the value chain. We've got another venture that is building hydrogen\\nrefueling facilities in California. And so we're leveraging existing assets, existing value chains and\\ncapabilities to invest here. As I say, smaller scale, and I don't want to overplay it, but it's very consistent\\nwith our strategy. And these things have got to start small and then scale. And so we're pleased with both\\nof these.\\nThere are markets, maybe to your point about economics that are, in some ways, heavily influenced by\\ngovernment policy, be it the renewable fuel standard and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which affect\\nrenewable fuels or some of the things in the investment or the inflation reduction act that affect hydrogen.\\nAnd so it makes them a little bit different than our traditional business, which really works off market\\nfundamentals. But we look at a lot of cases there, and we invest in projects where we believe there's\\nconfidence that over time, we can generate a good return.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\\nJohn Macalister Royall\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nSo my question is on West Coast refining. We now have one West asset producing gasoline on the West\\nCoast, and TMX should be increasing the availability of heavy crudes once it's ramped. But it's a tough\\nregulatory climate. And you're well positioned as one of the players that still has multiple assets in\\nCalifornia. How are you thinking about that region today? And should we see structurally higher gasoline\\nmargins in California given we've had some capacity come out?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nWell, look, we've been in California for our entire existence, 145 years. We've got an integrated value\\nchain that allows us to serve 2 competitive refineries and advantaged logistics that take us out into a\\nmarket where we've got a very strong brand and where the demand for all forms of energy continues to\\ngrow, be it power, be it transportation fuels. It's an economy that is large and demand continues to go up.\\nThat said, the policy environment has been one that is geared towards reducing investment in traditional\\nenergy, encouraging investments in these lower-carbon energies. And you've seen assets go out of the\\nsystem, fossil fuel-fired power plants. There's a lot of questions about the one remaining nuclear power\\nplant in the state. And you've seen refineries close down, as you say, some permanently, some to convert\\nto uses, including to renewable fuels. And what that does is it creates a tighter supply-demand balance,\\nparticularly as demand continues to be strong and you need to have strong operations out of that entire\\nsystem or you need to bring in supplies from somewhere else if you've got planned or unplanned issues\\nthat the system is dealing with.\\nAnd so on an average, what does that mean? It means margins are probably under more pressure. It\\nmeans reliable operations are very important. And it's a place where we've operated for a long time and\\nexpect to continue to do so. But putting new investment into the state is a different question. And I think\\nwe've been pretty clear that we've got a global portfolio and we'll invest where we see the best conditions,\\nand I wouldn't describe California that way today.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Alastair Syme with Citi.\\nAlastair Roderick Syme\\nCitigroup Inc., Research Division\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

I've read\\nall the documents, but just to get your sort of view. We've got a shareholder vote in May and we got\\nlimbo pending regulatory issues, but obviously, importantly, the arbitration. But maybe just talk about the\\narbitration timetable.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So there are, I think, really 3 things, if you're looking at sequencing and timing here. One is the\\nshareholder vote. And as I said, the proxy will be mailed out in April, and the shareholder vote will occur\\nin May. You've got regulatory approval through the FTC, and we're making good progress on that. We're\\nworking closely with the FTC in respect to their role in the process and expect us to be substantially\\ncomplete with that here by midyear.\\nAnd then we have the arbitration, which is, I think, a little bit less well defined at this point. The specific\\nscheduling and time line will be established by the arbitration tribunal. In our S-4, we indicated that Hess\\nhas asked the tribunal to hear the merits of the cases in the third quarter with an outcome in the fourth\\nquarter, which would allow us to close the transaction shortly thereafter. We see no legitimate reason to\\ndelay that time line. It's consistent with what Exxon has outlined is what they would expect. But I can't\\nsay that's exactly how it unfolds because we haven't seen specific scheduling from the tribunal yet.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist.\\nNeal David Dingmann\\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\\nMy question is on broad capital spend question specifically. Could you just maybe speak to -- do you have\\nsort of broad strokes what percent of total spend would be directed towards the New Energies and maybe\\nthe Chevron technology ventures? And I'm just wondering how you think about margins, even though it's\\nstill early for some, how the margins of these compare to your higher-return traditional margin business.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So there's a couple of kind of broad framing points, I think, to bear in mind as you think about that.\\nNumber one is we've guided to a long-term capital spend at around $16 billion. This year, we've got $15.5\\nbillion to $16.5 billion as a range. And we intend to be very disciplined with our capital investment and\\nonly invest in the most attractive opportunities.\\nWe've also indicated that over a period of time, beginning in 2022 through 2028, I think it was when we\\nannounced our -- we had our energy transition spotlight, that we expected to spend about $10 billion in\\nour New Energies business over that period of time, $8 billion in kind of the newer -- emerging business\\nlines of carbon capture and storage, renewable fuels and hydrogen and then another couple of billion in\\ndecarbonizing our own operations and businesses.\\nIt's not completely ratable. And that is a guide that we may or may not achieve. We may be a little\\nbelow that, we may be a little above that, depending upon how these opportunities mature in new\\nbusinesses. And to the earlier question, we need to be sure we've got confidence when we're putting\\ncapital, particularly large capital, some of the smaller things to help accelerate technology, learning, et\\ncetera, like our venture investments, which tend to be a few millions of dollars in any particular company.\\nWe recognize the risk-return equation there. But larger investments, we've got to have a belief that this\\nis a business that's going to deliver a return over time, and we're on the path to building a portfolio of\\nbusinesses that will do that. And so that $10 billion is a guide, but we'll invest in things that make sense,\\nand we'll explain the numbers if they end up a little bit different than that.\\nAnd so what that can tell you is the majority of our spend is still going into our traditional business\\nbecause the majority of the world's energy is still provided by our traditional business, and we've got an\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

But we're going to be very disciplined in what we\\ninvest in and only invest in the highest-return opportunities. And so each year, we issue specific guidance\\nthat we can -- you can look at. But longer term, I think you have to stay within those broad parameters\\nand expect us to remain disciplined.\\nJake Robert Spiering\\nDirector\\nWe would like to thank everyone for your time today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call\\nis being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of\\nChevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.\\nJake Spiering\\nWelcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Jake Spiering,\\nGeneral Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are\\non the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's\\nwebsite.\\nBefore we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other\\nforward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this\\npresentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.\\nNow I will turn it over to Mike.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nThanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron delivered another year of solid\\nresults in 2023. During a time of geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainty, our objective remained\\nunchanged: safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon.\\nOur clear and consistent approach resulted in an adjusted ROCE of 14% and enabled a record $26 billion\\nin cash returned to shareholders while growing production to a company record. We also successfully\\nintegrated PDC Energy and announced the Hess acquisition. We're now focused on the FTC second request\\nand expect to file the draft S-4 later this quarter with closing anticipated around the middle of the year.\\nAnd we continue to take action in lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and growing lower-\\ncarbon businesses, advancing foundational projects in both hydrogen and carbon capture. Over the past\\n5-year commodity cycle, with prices high, low and everywhere in between, Chevron led the peer group in\\nwhat we believe are the most important measures that create value.\\nWe were the most capital efficient while managing unit costs well below inflation and many peers. Capital\\nand cost discipline always matter in a commodity business. Combining this discipline with our focused\\nportfolio of advantaged assets, Chevron is able to lead the peer group in returning cash to shareholders.\\nOur 5-year dividend growth rate was greater than the S&P 500 and more than double our nearest peer.\\nSurplus cash was returned to our shareholders in each of the past 5 years through share buybacks. Our\\ntrack record is proven, and we intend to continue growing value for our shareholders in any environment.\\nIn the Permian, we delivered on our full year production guidance and set a quarterly record of 867,000\\nbarrels of oil equivalent per day while building our DUC inventory in the fourth quarter. Looking to the year\\nahead, our program is back-end loaded as we plan to continue to build our DUC inventory before adding\\nan additional completion crew in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect production in the first\\nhalf of the year to be down from the fourth quarter by about 2% to 4% before climbing toward a 2024 exit\\nrate around 900,000 barrels per day.\\nChevron is a clear leader in Permian financial returns with our unique royalty advantage and strong\\nexecution across a diverse portfolio. We have strong momentum and expect to achieve 1 million barrels of\\noil equivalent per day in 2025.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

This slide shows how the\\nproject fits within the overall field and facilities. The field, currently flowing at high pressure, continues to\\nkeep the existing plants full. In fact, 2023 net production was the highest since 2020.\\nWe've completed a lot of project scope that is already operational. TCO is producing from the new wells.\\nThe upgraded and new utilities, gathering system, control center and power distribution system are all\\ncurrently in operation.\\nFor WPMP, we're focused on starting up major equipment including gas turbine generators, pumps and\\ncompressors. We expect to hand over to operations the first pressure boost compressor in March for final\\ndynamic commissioning. Once we have PBF compression online, WPMP startup is expected to begin in the\\nsecond quarter when the first metering station is converted to low pressure, which will enable increased\\nflow rates.\\nLow-pressure production streams going back to existing process units will be driven by the pressure boost\\ncompression. At the same time, production from metering stations not yet converted will continue to flow\\nin the high-pressure system. We expect metering station conversions through the remainder of the year\\nas additional pressure boost compressors start-up, keeping the existing plants full around planned KTL and\\nSGI turnarounds.\\nFor FGP, we're focused on starting up additional gas turbine generators and compressors along with\\nmultiple processing units. The sour gas injection facilities have already been handed over to operations for\\na final commissioning. FGP startup is expected in the first half of next year when incremental production\\nenabled by fields conversion to low pressure will be processed in the new 3GP facility.\\nSince last quarter, 2 boilers came online and 2 gas turbine generators have delivered power. We've seen\\nimprovement in work scope delivery and have been working through additional discovery items. We'll\\ncontinue to update you on progress and remain focused on key milestones to deliver a safe and reliable\\nstartup.\\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2.3 billion or $1.22 per share. Adjusted earnings\\nwere $6.5 billion or $3.45 per share. Included in the quarter were $3.7 billion in charges preannounced in\\nJanuary. Foreign currency charges were almost $480 million.\\nOur 2023 CapEx included $650 million of inorganic acquisitions and around $450 million invested in legacy\\nPDC assets post closing. Excluding these items, CapEx was about 5% above budget after 3 consecutive\\nyears below.\\nShare repurchases matched the third quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong, ending the year with a\\nnet debt ratio comfortably in the single digits.\\nTurning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were higher than last quarter by roughly $730 million. Adjusted\\nupstream earnings improved due to higher liftings, in line with record quarterly production and favorable\\ntiming effects.\\nAdjusted downstream earnings decreased on lower refining margins, partially offset by a favorable swing\\nin timing effects. All other benefited from lower corporate taxes and employee costs.\\nFor the full year, adjusted earnings decreased nearly $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted\\nupstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower\\nlargely due to declining refining margins. Other segment earnings improved on lower employee costs and\\nhigher interest income.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nSolid financial performance enabled Chevron to deliver again on all 4 of its financial priorities. We\\nannounced an 8% increase in our dividend, reflecting our confidence in expected future free cash flow\\ngrowth.\\nWe maintained capital discipline in both traditional and new energies. We reduced debt by over $4\\nbillion, including all debt assumed in the PDC acquisition. And we repurchased about 5% of our shares\\noutstanding.\\nLast year, we produced more oil and gas than in any other year in the company's history, including a\\nrecord number of LNG cargoes out of Australia. We expect 2024 production to be higher again by 4% to\\n7%.\\nOur plans include production growth in the DJ Basin with a full year of legacy PDC operations and\\ncontinued organic growth in the Permian. Our guidance this year includes an estimated impact from asset\\nsales as we further high-grade our portfolio.\\nLooking ahead, our first quarter downtime estimate includes around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent\\nper day associated with January's cold weather in North America. Earnings estimates from refinery\\nturnarounds are mostly driven by Pascagoula.\\nShare repurchases in the quarter will continue to be restricted under SEC regulations. Depending on\\ncommodity prices and margins, affiliate dividends are estimated around $4 billion, roughly flat with last\\nyear. We do not expect significant affiliate dividends in the first quarter. The difference between affiliate\\nearnings and dividends is expected to decrease in the second half of the year after TCO startup of WPMP.\\nOur CapEx guidance range is unchanged from the December budget announcement. In prior years, our\\nCapEx rate in the first half of the year was about 20% lower than the second half. Our price sensitivities\\nhave increased at higher production levels. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG\\nsales, and less than 10% relates to North America natural gas liquids.\\nBack to you, Mike.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nIn closing, our priorities are clear: safely execute with excellence, maintain capital and cost discipline\\nand return cash to shareholders. We're excited about the pending Hess acquisition, which will further\\nstrengthen Chevron.\\nI also want to personally thank Pierre for his invaluable contributions over his 35-year career with our\\ncompany. He's been an exceptional strategic partner to me and an outstanding leader, helping guide\\nChevron to create significant value for shareholders. I wish him all the best in his retirement.\\nAnd I'll hand it off to Jake.\\nJake Spiering\\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions.

Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThank you, Biraj.\\nBiraj Borkhataria\\nRBC Capital Markets, Research Division\\nAnd thanks for all the help over recent years. I feel compelled to ask you a question on buybacks because\\nthis is your last time, but I'll try and resist.\\nSo the question is on the Permian. You had a very strong production number in Q4, quite an inflection\\nfrom what we've seen in the last few quarters. And I was interested in particular the comment on that\\nvolume growth alongside building the DUC inventory.\\nSo presumably, the non-op side was a nice contribution in Q4. So could you just give some clarity on the\\nbridge sort of 3Q to 4Q because the market has been concerned about you hitting the numbers, at least\\nfor this year, most recently.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nSure. So in the third quarter, non-op was a little light. But in the fourth quarter, it came back. It didn't end\\nthe year, non-op and royalty are right where we guided to from the beginning of the year.\\nSo through the -- through a year, the quarterly ups and downs on some of these things can create some\\nquestions, but it came in right as we guided to it in the mid-teens. The story on the fourth quarter was\\nreally strong execution.\\nWe had more POPs. We -- because we had faster drilling and faster cycle time on completions, we had a\\nshorter cycle time from frac to POP. So all of those increased. And as you noted, we did continue to build\\nour DUC inventory because drilling performance was so strong.\\nA couple of other things. POPs in the fourth quarter were weighted towards New Mexico. We had guided\\ntowards activity that would lead to more POPs in New Mexico in the second half of the year. Those wells\\nare more productive than kind of on average than the rest of the portfolio. So that flows through.\\nAnd then the final thing that I would point to is we had higher reliability. You'll recall in the third\\nquarter, we talked a little bit about some midstream constraints and other things that weren't related to\\ncompletions or POPs or anything else, but there were constraints on flow.\\nWe had fewer frac hits. We had fewer scheduled delays, weather downtime and midstream issues in the\\nquarter. So all of that contributed to the strong performance there in the fourth quarter, and we ended the\\nyear right on our guidance.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\\nNeil Singhvi Mehta\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nYes. Thank you so much, Pierre. You're going out in style. And thanks for all the great insights and wisdom\\nover the years.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThanks, Neil.\\nNeil Singhvi Mehta\\nGoldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division\\nThe -- my question is on Slide 6, the TCO update. It sounds like the schedule and the cost guidance that\\nwas provided in November is still on track. But for us non-engineers maybe, Mike, you can kind of walk\\nus through the schematic and help us understand what these boxes are the critical path issues that we\\nshould be focused on.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So you're right, Neil, the schedule and cost guidance is unchanged. I apologize for a more complex\\nslide than we usually put out in front of you. But we want to be as transparent as we can and help people\\nunderstand what's going on there at the field.\\nLast quarter, we talked about our action plan, and we're seeing improved productivity. We shifted scope\\namongst contractors. We've added more engineering support in the field. And as we move through this,\\nwe're encountering discovery work as we expected. We found some around piping stress and alignment\\nthat we're working on right now.\\nThe key thing to think about here is first of all, there's a lot of stuff that's up and running. All the new\\nwells are producing right now. All this infrastructure in terms of utility and power distribution and control\\ncenter is up and running.\\nAnd as we -- so that's keeping the plants full, and we saw a really strong performance last year, I\\nmentioned the strongest in 4 years and the fourth strongest in the history of the field. So we're seeing\\ngood deliverability out of the new wells, which is the key thing for production this year is keeping those\\nplants full while we begin to convert the field from pushing into a high-pressure plant to lower back\\npressure on the field, which improves deliverability from the wells and allows us to extend the life of the\\nfield and get up to 1 million barrels a day.\\nSo when we begin converting these metering stations and there are 21 of them, we will then take\\nproduction from a metering station now that is producing under low pressure. And we'll boost that back up\\nto get into the existing plant.\\nAs we get more and more of those, converted more of these pressure boost compressors online, we'll\\nget the whole field now producing against the lower back pressure, which gives us a lot of excess well\\ncapacity. And it ensures that we are going to keep the plant full.\\nAnd as we then bring on the new process equipment, we start to route that low-pressure production into\\na plant that will run at lower pressure. And so that's really the kind of the high-level description of what\\nwe're trying to convey there. And we've got a legend that shows you certain things we're going to begin\\nstartup in various quarters.\\nFor FGP, we're focused on commissioning the major equipment there that will allow us to bring up the\\nplant that will take us to 1 million barrels a day. And we're transferring learnings from compressors,\\npumps and other things that we're working on now, walking down the critical substations. And we'll\\ncontinue to provide updates on the key milestones here. We're talking about a couple of gas turbine\\ngenerators online.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nFirst quarter's inlet separator is ready for operation. We'll commission that on sweet fluids as we prepared\\nfor sour production. And then, as I said in the second quarter, we begin the PBF startup and metering\\nstation conversions. So it's all on track with our guidance, and we will continue to provide you detail as we\\nmove forward each quarter on specific milestones and progress.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Doug Leggate with Bank of America.\\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nPierre, I have to offer my congrats as well. And with the quarter to date, thanks for making us in the sell-\\nside look smart. A nice way to go out. The best wishes in retirement.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThank you, Doug.\\nDouglas George Blyth Leggate\\nBofA Securities, Research Division\\nMy question, Mike, is, I guess, it's got a part A and B, so apologies to Jake on that. But it's kind of around\\ndisposals. Our understanding from the Hess side is that despite the fact that you haven't filed the S-4 yet,\\nyou haven't got the FTC yet, and I realize that those processes are ongoing, but the integration planning is\\nstill going ahead full steam.\\nAnd I'm just curious if you can offer any color on how that process has evolved as it relates specifically\\nto portfolio high grading. The absence of Malaysia in your go-forward plan, for example, it seems to me a\\n$15 billion number might have a lot of upside. So any color you can offer on that topic, please.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Doug, it's really premature for us to comment on that until the transaction closes. Hess has a pretty\\ntight portfolio of assets that are performing well. And we really need to close the deal, have access to all\\nthe data and reoptimize all of our views of portfolio investments and update our new plan. And so I don't\\nwant to speculate on any assets.\\nAnd look, we've got some of our own assets that we do have out in the public domain already. You may\\nhave seen reports on Kaybob Duvernay, on Congo. So there are some divestments that we have signaled\\nout of the Chevron portfolio.\\nAnd I think as you see the divestments unfold over the next few years because we will have more assets\\nin the portfolio that come from legacy Chevron, that is likely to be a greater contributor, I would guess, to\\nthe overall $10 billion to $15 billion number than things that come in through this transaction. But I can't\\ncomment on Malaysia or any other particular asset until we get past the close.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.\\nJoshua Ian Silverstein\\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\\nComing back to the Permian, you're stepping up the CapEx this year to about $5 billion versus $4 billion\\nlast year to help you deliver the year-over-year growth. As you continue to ramp towards the 1 million\\nBOE per day target, what's needed from a CapEx standpoint to deliver this growth? Can you stay closer\\nto the $5 billion range? Or does that step up towards $6 billion in 2025 because you have an accelerating\\npace to hit that?\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. No, appreciate the question, Josh. We're starting this year with 12 rigs and 3 frac crews. I mentioned\\nwe'll add a fourth frac crew around the middle of the year.\\nBut at the same time, we're becoming more efficient. We need fewer rigs to drill the planned lateral feet\\nthat we've got out in front of us. And so as we close in on 1 million barrels a day, we're at the capital level\\nthat I think is going to be required to get us there.\\nAnd then the really nice thing about this is, when you're trying to hold the plateau as opposed to grow\\nfrom 700,000 to 800,000 to 900,000 to 1 billion -- 1 million a day, you actually can pull capital spending\\ndown because you're offsetting decline. You're not trying to offset decline and grow by significant chunks\\neach year.\\nAnd so inflation has moderated, and that has been a challenge. We've talked about some of the things,\\nwe're moving water around a little bit more, but that's embedded in our plan now going forward. So I\\nwould not anticipate that we're going to have to go towards $6 billion in order to get there.\\nAnd as we get to each year, we'll give you an updated guide on it. But when we plateau production, capital\\nspending and capital discipline really matters. I just want to emphasize this. We intend to live within our\\ncapital means and be really tight on capital. And that applies to the Permian along with every other asset.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.\\nPaul Cheng\\nScotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division\\nAnd first, I want to congratulate, Pierre, and thank you for all the years, actually over the past couple of\\ndecades that all the help, we may appreciate.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThanks, Paul.\\nPaul Cheng\\nScotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division\\nMike and Pierre, I think, Mike, when you first become the CEO, I think one focus is that cost matter for\\nyou. And that over the last several years, there's a lot of acquisition and change in portfolio. So it's very\\ndifficult for us from the outside to see where is your cost structure comparing to, let's say, before the\\npandemic in 2019.\\nIs there any way that you can help us in terms of what is the structural cost base there for you to date\\ncomparing to, say, a number of years ago, especially during the early part of the pandemic, you guys did\\nhave a restructuring effort.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes, Paul, I don't have all that stuff right on the top of my head to go back to 2019. It's a fair request. But\\nlook, I think we showed a chart in here over the last several years that our unit costs are relatively flat. In\\nfact, I think we're #2 on that chart. We don't break out each of the competitors.\\nOur unit OpEx last year was about 15 80 a barrel, which is about 5% lower than the year before. And we\\nstill have outstanding unit OpEx reduction targets going out to 2026 at mid-cycle.\\nWe've had some inflation along the way. But you're right, we took a lot of costs out of the business in\\n2020 and 2021.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nSo as we bring together Hess, and this gets a little bit to the question that Doug was asking as well,\\nwe will come out with an update to investors that talks about the portfolio, updates guidance on all the\\nmetrics that matter. And I assure you that I have not changed my view that cost control always matters,\\nand capital discipline always matters. So we'll update you on those numbers specifically, Paul.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.\\nSam Jeffrey Margolin\\nWolfe Research, LLC\\nAnd thanks for everything, Pierre. Maybe this one will be a easy or a hard one for you depending on\\nwhat you're planning for. But it's about -- it's a follow-up on TCO in Kazakhstan and the affiliate dividend\\nguidance.\\nAnd what's interesting about it is that it's flat year-over-year with a commodity assumption that may be\\na little bit lower than the prior year. And within affiliates, there's also some LNG exposure, which isn't as\\nstrong as it was last year ex TCO.\\nAnd so I guess the question is like you've given this really robust technical update on Tengiz and where\\nwe stand. But are we already at a point where TCO is sustaining a level of dividends that's a little bit more\\nstable than it was kind of at the peak of the construction process or the installation process, and we're\\nsort of in a progression to this pro forma very stable cash flow profile from TCO? Or is that number -- am I\\nreading too much into that affiliate guidance number?\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThanks, Sam. Absolutely, TCO dividends are on a higher trajectory just because capital is -- has wound\\ndown. And as we've said, when we get the incremental production from FGP, it goes even higher.\\nThere are some puts and takes. So we talked in last year, the TCO had held some surplus cash and\\nreleased that last year. This year, they're going to have to build some cash as they head into debt\\npayments, which, as you recall, we co-lend. We will be receiving that.\\nSo there are some -- there will be some timing variation. But your point around the trajectory is absolutely\\nright because CapEx is winding down. So this has been largely self-funded. As an affiliate company, as\\nCapEx goes down, there's more cash available. It does depend on commodity price assumptions.\\nYou're right, LNG is in there and also petchem. And so those are the major drivers, a little bit of refining\\nare the major drivers of our affiliate dividends. So it's a roughly flat with the prior year. We'll update that\\nas we go along during the year.\\nBut absolutely, TCO, we've been investing in that project for 8 years. It's going to generate a lot of cash\\nwhen it comes on next year.\\nAnd maybe, Sam, just one more point. What you're going to see, too, is because it's tricky as an affiliate,\\nthat line, that's affiliated earnings less dividend, that's going to flip. And until you see it, it will be hard\\nfor everyone to model it. But what has been historically aligned where affiliate earnings are higher than\\ndividends, you will see that flip in time as we pull out more cash out of TCO, in particular, than the\\nearnings than the book earnings are.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.\\nNitin Kumar\\nMizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nSo part A and part B type of question, but really on the Permian. Mike, in your slides, you highlight that\\noptimized well spacing and maybe coring up where you were drilling in 2023 helped the well productivity.\\nAt the Analyst Day, you had talked about some technologies. And I'm just curious, were any of the\\nimprovements you saw in '23 related to those?\\nAnd then part B very quickly is you're growing almost 200,000 barrels from here until -- in the next\\n2 years. Last quarter, you had some infrastructure issues. What are you doing to get ahead of those\\ninfrastructure issues that don't resurface over that time period?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Nitin, what I would say on technology, I referenced the fact that we're drilling more feet out of the\\nsame rig fleet. We're improving on completions. And so there are a lot of small things that are contributing\\nto the performance that we're seeing right now.\\nThe improved recovery technologies are in various stages of being piloted out in the field. And so to the\\nextent some of those pilots are in the production, they contribute. But I would say it's at the margin\\nbecause we're gathering field data to look at changes in completion and fracture techniques using gas\\ninjection and gas lift in different ways using some different chemicals to improve flow.\\nSo as we get those into large-scale deployment, we'll start to talk about that, and we'll help you\\nunderstand how they're contributing. But I would say right now, it's more on the drilling and completions\\ncycle time side that we're seeing some of these improvements. And so there's more to come.\\nOn midstream infrastructure, the -- some of the issues that we've talked about before can be -- they can\\nbe weather-related. They can be related to some regulatory items. They can be related to a particular\\ngas processing plant or gathering or offtake pipeline system. We're working all of those because your\\npoint is well made. As a large producing asset at that scale, we need really, really reliable performance\\ndownstream of the wells.\\nAnd we have no constraints on takeaway capacity out of the basin. So we're well positioned not just for\\n'24, but into '25 and '26 with ultimate takeaway capacity to access the market. But we do have a lot of\\npipes, pumps, tanks and other things between the field and the market, and those things need to perform.\\nAnd that is a high priority for our operations team in the field.\\nAs I mentioned, fourth quarter performance was very strong. And they're on this, and it's a very high\\npriority. We saw a little bit of weather in January, which Pierre guided to, that will have a modest impact.\\nBut we're confident that we've got a line of sight on all the operational priorities in order to ensure that,\\nthat market access isn't constrained.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.\\nDevin J. McDermott\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nPierre, I want to echo the congrats. Thanks for all the help over the years.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nThanks, Devin.\\nDevin J. McDermott\\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\\nI wanted to circle back to TCO. And Mike, I think last quarter, when you provided the updated guidance on\\ntimeline, one of the things that you noted was workforce productivity. And I was wondering if you could\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\ncomment on some of the changes that you've implemented to improve labor productivity over the past\\nseveral months, how it's progressing versus plan.\\nAnd in your comments, you mentioned improved scope of work in the context of FGP. I'm not sure that's\\nrelated to labor or something else. But if you could elaborate on that comment as well, that would be\\ngreat.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So we have multiple contractors working on commissioning and startup. And so this is everything\\nfrom walking systems down to ensure that they've been properly inspected that we refer to as punchlist\\nitems have been identified, which is work that still needs to be completed by contractors.\\nAnd then you get into the loop checks and equipment runs and all the work to bring pieces of equipment\\nup into service. So we've got a number of contractors working on this. We've moved scope from\\ncontractors that have had lower productivity to those that have exhibited higher productivity.\\nWe've brought in additional resources to beef up the overall capacity. And on the resources or the\\ncontractors that have lower productivity, we've worked with them to understand where are the constraints\\nin the bottlenecks.\\nAnd we've seen one who had a productivity factor as we measure it that was down in the kind of 0.4 range\\npreviously is up above 0.7 now, and we're targeting to get that up again by a similar quantum. So there's\\na lot of work on the ground to be sure we got the right people working on the right things so we have\\nenough contract resources there that we're also bringing in technical resources as we discover items that\\nneed more technical solutions. And that can include company people or vendor people, and we're out\\nmuch further ahead.\\nLast quarter or the quarter before, the walk downs and other identification of issues was a few short\\nweeks ahead of the crews that were actually doing this work. We're several weeks now, 7, 8 or more\\nweeks out ahead of the teams that are doing the work.\\nSo you've got a much better ability to plan and execute the work in a much more efficient manner\\nbecause you've got some time to put the work 33:30 back together, get the permitting done, be sure that\\nyou've got all the right tools, equipment, et cetera.\\nSo it's a great, big project, Devin. It's the largest brownfield project and most complex brownfield project\\nI've seen in my life. And we're seeing good improvements in terms of the on-the-ground performance out\\nof our team and out of all the contractor teams that are working on this.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.\\nJason Daniel Gabelman\\nTD Cowen, Research Division\\nYes.

All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nprovided, particularly for the Delaware at the 2023 Capital Markets Day when you forecasted a large\\nimprovement in productivity. Can you just talk about if your type curves, particularly in the Delaware\\nBasin, ended up in line with where you anticipated them being as shown in that Capital Markets Day type\\ncurve?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So I'll quickly just touch on the Midland Basin, where we continue to be a first quartile performer,\\nsteady consistent performance. We understand the geology. There's less fluid complexity. And so we're a\\ntop quartile, first quartile performer there in the Midland.\\nIn the Delaware, we last year showed actual data on a Delaware-wide basis. And then we showed some\\nforward guidance, particularly focused on New Mexico because we were shifting so much of our program\\ninto New Mexico, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a more productive portion of the basin.\\nAnd in the Delaware, New Mexico we saw a significant improvement with our second half POPs last year.\\nMore than 80% of our POPs were in the second half in these more productive areas, and the subsurface\\nperformance there has been very strong. In the appendix, we've got a slide that shows you 49 out of the\\n59 POPs were in the second half. And you can see that they lay right on the type curve.\\nAnd then you can see the improvement in the Delaware Basin, Texas, which we didn't guide to last year\\nbecause it was in that combined chart there. But we've seen strong improvement. We've updated our well\\nspacing and completion designs there.\\nAnd within the basin, there are subbasins, and some of those are performing exceptionally strong as well.\\nSo we're seeing performance that is very consistent with what we outlined in the Markets Day last year.\\nI think the shift in basis was just to provide you a little bit more detail into these sub basis, and we'll\\ncontinue to report on that basis going forward.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nAnd just as a reminder, too, Jason, so last year's performance in New Mexico, it wasn't impacted by long-\\nsitting DUC. So the year-on-year is bang on. It's consistent with the said guidance, and you see the\\nimprovement in Texas because there was the impact from long-sitting DUCs in the prior year.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Co.\\nJeoffrey Restituto Lambujon\\nTudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division\\nI wanted to follow up actually on the Permian and specifically ask on the program this year. What kind of\\nopportunity do you see from here for further improvements to spacing and completion design, cycle times\\nif any, in the Texas, Delaware region?\\nAnd could -- what's working well there translate to New Mexico to make those wells even stronger, quicker\\nto jump and complete or even to the Midland side? And then secondly, how are you all thinking about the\\nmix of capital allocation across these regions within the Permian throughout this year?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So we're constantly looking to learn and improve. And as I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant\\nimprovement in drilling time, completion time, time for completion to POP this year. And these are a lot\\nof little things, right. This is -- as you continue doing things, you find more and more efficiencies. We can\\nbring more technology to bear, et cetera.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nSo -- and we look to extend those learnings across the basin, and frankly, between basins. So into the DJ\\nBasin and from the DJ Basin down to the Permian. There are differences in the sub basins that you have to\\nunderstand and respect.\\nBut I mean, the short answer is yes. We are looking for ways to transfer learnings across there. And\\nevery time I think we're probably at the plateau in terms of productivity improvement, smart people find\\nways to continue to get even better at this. And so I don't think we've seen the end of the performance\\nimprovement cycle.\\nOur overall capital allocation into the basin is largely a function of where our portfolio lies. About 25% is\\nin the Midland Basin, 25% is in the Delaware New Mexico portion of the basin and then the balance, about\\n50%, is in Delaware Texas. It's been that way here. This past year and going forward, that's a pretty good\\nway to approximate it.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.\\nJohn Macalister Royall\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division\\nAnd congratulations to Pierre. I'm going to give you guys a break on TCO and the Permian. I'm going to\\nask a question on the DJ. So just looking at this growth of 125 kbd for '24, how should we think about that\\ngrowth off of a pro forma '23 basis? Just trying to understand what's kind of the underlying real growth\\nrate in the DJ. And then if you could just update us with a couple of quarters behind you now post PDC on\\nyour broader plans for development in the DJ.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. So we've now got a -- fourth quarter is the first full quarter with PDC. The third quarter, we had 2\\nmonths out of the 3 with PDC in there. And you can see we came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit over\\n400,000 barrels a day, which is, our plans are to hold the DJ around 400,000 barrels a day going forward\\nin a highly efficient factory.\\nAnd the fourth quarter was maybe even a little stronger than we might have expected. There wasn't\\nas much weather-related downtime in November and December. And then there were some accounting\\nadjustments that were booked into the fourth quarter that were not really related in operations.\\nSo the above 400 is there's a few things contributing to that, that probably are not repeating or going to\\npull back a little bit. But we're confident we can hold around 400,000 barrels a day.\\nWe're still executing the well design and well spacing that was in the PDC basis of design, which is a little\\nbit different than ours, a little -- a few more wells and tighter spacing and driven more to drive volume.\\nOur basis of design is more focused on return on invested capital. And so it's wider spacing, it's bigger\\nfracs, but it's less capital overall and higher return.\\nAnd so as we transition to a standardized -- more standardized basis design across the basin, you'll see\\nthat roll into the numbers. We've got 4 rigs that are going. We've got permits out for multiple years,\\nnearly to the end of the decade. And so we're very, very pleased, and we're learning things, I got to tell\\nyou.\\nThere's some stuff that we've learned from PDC that will apply not only in the rest of the DJ, but it's going\\nto apply in the Permian as well that's going to help us. So going forward, these are high cash margin, low\\nbreakeven barrels.\\nWe plan to hold it at a plateau around 400. And we've -- synergies are on track there. We've got virtually\\nall the CapEx synergies are essentially in the bag. We're already down to $1 billion there.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nOpEx is very close to the $100 million we guided to. We're now seeing some procurement synergies, which\\nwe hadn't originally envisioned. So everything about it is at or better than what we had guided to.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Lucas Herrmann with BNP Paribas.\\nLucas Oliver Herrmann\\nBNP Paribas Exane, Research Division\\nYes. And Pierre, I'll add my kind of comments to the host already. But thank you for all the insights. It's\\nalways been worth listening to.\\nWhen I look at the growth that you're likely to see in oil in particular over the next 2 to 3 years, I mean,\\nit feels as though you're going to be adding towards 0.5 million, maybe slightly more barrels of pretty\\nhigh-margin black oil. And I guess the question is about whiplash and this increased sensitivity that the\\nbusiness is going to have to movements in volatile commodity.\\nAnd what you feel, Pierre, might that implies the balance sheet and the way you think about balance\\nsheet and managing things. And just if I could add on, could you just give me an idea of what the loan\\nrepayment schedule looks like at TCO. And I presume that loan repayments will go through the net in, the\\nnet out line in -- on the CapEx side or the investment side of the equation or do they play elsewhere?\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nRight. No, thanks, Lucas. I'll take it. We've been overweighed upstream and overweighed oil liquids for a\\nlong time. And you're right, recent acquisitions and Hess certainly adds to that, and we like that exposure.\\nIn terms of how we manage the balance sheet, I mean, the first thing is we start with our breakeven. So\\nwhat it takes -- the oil price it takes to cover our CapEx and dividends, that was in the low 50s last year.\\nAnd so we see mostly upside. And that's why we had record share buybacks last year, almost $15 billion,\\n5% of our shares outstanding because we're built for a price well below where we currently are.\\nWe've also done it while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our net debt ratio is 7%. We've said as we\\nkeep our share repurchases steady across the cycle that we're okay relevering back up towards the low\\nend of our guidance range, which is 20% to 25%.\\nSo that guidance, that's a kind of through the cycle net debt ratio guidance, that still holds. And if we had\\na significant change in the portfolio, of course, we would look at that or even we would look at that going\\nforward.\\nBut I think the actions that we're taking are consistent with that guidance. And again, adding that\\nexposure when you're built at the breakeven -- when we think about our balance sheet, you take into\\naccount lots of things, your portfolio, the commodity price outlook, but your breakeven is really key.\\nAnd Mike was talking about capital and cost discipline, our ability to fund our reinvestment program in\\nboth traditional and new energies and grow the company and pay a growing dividend, right, twice -- more\\nthan twice our nearest peer, greater than S&P 500. We just increased at 8%. So all those numbers are\\nbefore the latest increase.\\nWe can do all that at a low price, return surplus cash, that's how we're going to think about it. So again,\\nyou should expect our net debt to increase over time depending on commodity prices and how we've\\nreturned cash to shareholders. I would not -- having more exposure to high-margin barrels, as you say,\\nthat's a good thing. We're built for it. And as long as we keep our breakeven low and below where prices\\nare trading, we're in a really good spot.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nAnd how TCO order payments flow through.\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nOh, yes. So TCO loan payments -- sorry about that. Yes, because I alluded to that, that will not be in cash\\nfrom ops. That shows up in our investing cash. So Jake and the team will take you all through that.\\nBut yes, what I was saying about that affiliate line flipping, that's separate from this. In a different line,\\nwe will see cash being returned. And it's $1 billion our share next year. Again, $22 billion in '26 and then\\nin '28 or '30. So all that's disclosed in our 10-K. Jake, can take you through that. But yes, that's only\\nadditional. And again, we shouldn't be surprised. We've been investing for 8 years in this project. That\\ncash is going to come back once the project starts out.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe Generale.\\nIrene Himona\\nSociete Generale Cross Asset Research\\nAnd Pierre, all the best for the next chapter. My question is on Henry Hub. In the new sensitivities you\\npublished today, you saw a very material 30% increase in your Henry Hub sensitivity. Is this purely\\nbecause of PDC? And related to that, on a macro level, if you can perhaps share your views on the 2024\\noutlook for Henry Hub, please?\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nSo I'll start, Irene, and then Mike can take the macro. Yes, it's a function of PDC certainly and then just\\ncontinued -- the associated gas that comes along with the Permian. So as we're growing that, it obviously\\ncomes along with natural gas.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. And Irene, the macro I was pulling up the slide on the Henry Hub sensitivity. So broadly speaking,\\noil markets are pretty balanced right now. I think the geopolitics are the thing that are harder to call and\\ncould drive movements one way or the other. It could be OPEC+ decisions, can be this conflict in the\\nMiddle East. Economic growth in the world continues to be decent, and our outlook on demand growth for\\nall this year is maybe not quite as strong as last year, but still growing.\\nGas is a little bit different. The inventories are high in the U.S. Inventories are high in Europe. We're kind\\nof mostly through the winter time, certainly through the riskiest period of the winter time. And now there's\\nquestions that are not going to really weigh on the market in the near term, but maybe longer term about\\nexports out of the U.S.\\nAnd so all of that has got gas markets under a little more pressure than oil markets or refined products.\\nAnd it's not unusual. Pierre was just talking about how we build the company to compete through the\\ncycles and different parts of the portfolio basket.\\nPetrochemicals are under some pressure right now as well. And so at any point in time, we're going to find\\nsome of the fundamentals probably under pressure. Others are looking pretty good. And here in the short\\nterm, I think Henry Hub is in the under pressure category.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research.\\nRobert Alan Brackett\\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 17\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nIf I look at the production guide of 4% to 7% growth on, say, 3.1 million, and I try to book end that\\nbetween a fourth quarter closer to 3 4 and 2025, where we're going to see TCO FGP startup plus hitting\\nthat 1 million-barrel a day milestone in the Permian sort of implies there's an inflection point in production\\ngrowth coming at some point or perhaps there's a conservative guide for this year. Is that the right way to\\nthink about it?\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nWell, coming into this year, we now have a full year of PDC that will be part of the portfolio. So that's\\npretty safe in terms of counting on that. I've already mentioned that fourth quarter was a little bit higher\\nthan maybe we even might have expected because we had high reliability.\\nSome of these midstream issues we had faced in the Permian had -- didn't repeat. We have this\\naccounting catch-up thing in the Permian as well. And we had a pretty light turnaround schedule in the\\nfourth quarter. So it was a strong quarter all the way around.\\nAs we head into next year, we've got some asset sales in the guidance. And Bob, we've been at the low\\nend -- we've kind of ended up last couple of years hitting our guidance range but at the low end. And so\\nI think you could probably think of us as being a little more comfortable in the middle of the range this\\nyear, given a number of other things that you mentioned. So we try to give you guidance each year that\\nwe expect to hit, and we certainly expect to hit it this year.\\nOperator\\nWe will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.\\nNeal David Dingmann\\nTruist Securities, Inc., Research Division\\nAnd my question, Mike, is maybe just on the shareholder return specifically. Trying to get a sense of -- it\\nsounds like you will, but just want to get a sense if you'll continue paying out majority of free cash flow for\\nthe remainder of this year. And if the buybacks will continue to constitute a bit over 50% of that payout.\\nMichael K. Wirth\\nChairman & CEO\\nYes. Neal, we have not used some percentage or range of percentage of cash from operations as kind of a\\ngo-buy for distributions. What we've done is have leaned on our track record on the dividend, first of all.\\nAnd we've already clarified what you can expect this year with the 8% increase that we've announced.\\nAnd then I would point you back towards our upside and downside guidance that we've had out there now\\nfor a number of years. $10 billion to $20 billion on the range for buybacks. And that's in an upside price\\ncase, we'd be up towards the higher end of that, in a lower price case, down at the lower end, both of\\nwhich we can comfortably handle.\\nWe have indicated that post the Hess close, all other things equal, we'll see when it happens and how the\\nworld looks when we get there. But we would expect to move from a rate of 17.5 to the top end of 20\\nbecause we're so confident in the long-term cash productive capacity of our portfolio and the strength of\\nour balance sheet.\\nSo rather than focusing in on those percentages, I'd really point you towards the specific guidance that\\nwe've issued in the kind of the track record. Now -- and of course, I think Pierre mentioned this in his\\ncomments, we do remain under SEC restrictions right now relative to the rate at which we can buy back\\nand then look out of the market when the Hess proxy is open. And so all of these things are -- under\\nnormal times, we don't have one of those constraints on us.\\nPierre R. Breber\\nVP & CFO\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 18\\nCHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024\\nAnd I would just add -- let me just add a little bit. It's fitting maybe my last words will be on share\\nbuybacks. 6 straight years of buyback, right. 17 out of the past 21 years, but we actually bought back\\nmore shares last year than the year before, even though earnings and cash flow were higher, right. There\\nwere records in '22, still strong in '23.\\nThat's the whole point. We're trying to be steady across the commodity cycle. We've heard from investors\\nthat buybacks should not be procyclical. And it's hard to be countercyclical in the commodity business that\\nhas some price volatility.\\nSo being steady across the cycle is how we guide to it. And these formulas, in fact, reinforce the opposite.\\nThey reinforce procyclicality. So we're giving a return that, in some ways, is almost independent in prices\\nwithin a range because we're -- could have paid more out in '22, but we held it back. And we used some\\nof that to pay in '23. We'll see where it goes, but the intent is to try to be steady across the cycle, either\\nprocyclical or countercyclical.\\nJake Spiering\\nThank you. I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and\\nyour participation on today's call. Please stay safe and healthy.
