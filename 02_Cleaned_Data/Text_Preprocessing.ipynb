It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic.\\nThe reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival Exxon Mobil Corp., which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.\\nBy some measures, the pandemic hit the energy industry harder than any other major segment of the U.S. economy in 2020. Oil-and-gas companies collectively lost more market value, on a percentage basis, from the beginning of the year than any other major sector. Dozens of companies sought chapter 11 protection from creditors, while tens of thousands of oil workers have lost their jobs.\\nThe sizable spending cuts by Exxon and Chevron this week mean that there will be even less work for the oil-field services companies that employ many of the industry's ground-level workers, and that oil regions in many parts of the world will see reduced economic activity.\\n\\\"Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,\\\" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.\\nIn October, Chevron told investors it would spend around $14 billion in 2021 and indicated its long-term budget could be reduced as well. Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet.\\nThe company's share price is down about 5% over the past six months and closed at $89.78, up 0.1%, Thursday.\\nPierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said the company's spending plans represent an expectation of lower commodity prices over the next five years.\\n\\\"It also reflects that we are an industry performing poorly relative to other investment opportunities,\\\" Mr. Breber said. \\\"Everything [Chevron is] looking at is through the lens of capital discipline and generating higher returns.\\\"\\nCovid-19 has gutted demand for oil and gas as automobile and plane travel declined sharply amid global lockdowns and other measures to contain the virus. Chevron has let its production slide due to the weakened demand, choosing to give priority to directing its cash flow to dividend payments. It reiterated Thursday its commitment to its dividend.\\nEven before the pandemic, the fossil-fuel industry was contending with an oversupply of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers, increased competition from renewable-energy sources and electric vehicles, while also contending with the prospect of increased climate-change regulation.\\nSince the end of last year, Chevron has been implementing a year-long restructuring in response to an anticipated period of prolonged low commodity prices. It is in the process of cutting up to 15% of its 45,000-person staff.\\nIn July, Chevron agreed to acquire Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, one of the larger energy deals this year. Chevron didn't say Thursday how much of its capital spending would be directed to Noble's assets. It previously said it expects about $300 million in annual cost savings from integrating Noble.\\nPaul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research, said Chevron's capital cuts are significant, especially because Noble wasn't factored into the prior spending guidance. Still, Mr. Sankey said Chevron is in a better position than many of its peers. \\\"Chevron came into 2020 best prepared in terms of capex and balance sheet, and leaves 2020 in best shape,\\\" he said.\\nChevron said it would increase investments in its stronger assets, including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. shale, including in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. It also said it would invest $300 million in projects related to a transition to a lower-carbon-energy economy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chevron-slash-capital-spending/docview/2466698861/se-2?accountid=7064\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic.\\nThe reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival Exxon Mobil Corp., which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.\\nBy some measures, the pandemic hit the energy industry harder than any other major segment of the U.S. economy in 2020. Oil-and-gas companies collectively lost more market value, on a percentage basis, from the beginning of the year than any other major sector. Dozens of companies sought chapter 11 protection from creditors, while tens of thousands of oil workers have lost their jobs.\\nThe sizable spending cuts by Exxon and Chevron this week mean that there will be even less work for the oil-field services companies that employ many of the industry's ground-level workers, and that oil regions in many parts of the world will see reduced economic activity.\\n\\\"Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,\\\" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.\\nIn October, Chevron told investors it would spend around $14 billion in 2021 and indicated its long-term budget could be reduced as well. Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet.\\nThe company's share price is down about 5% over the past six months and closed at $89.78, up 0.1%, Thursday.\\nPierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said the company's spending plans represent an expectation of lower commodity prices over the next five years.\\n\\\"It also reflects that we are an industry performing poorly relative to other investment opportunities,\\\" Mr. Breber said. \\\"Everything [Chevron is] looking at is through the lens of capital discipline and generating higher returns.\\\"\\nCovid-19 has gutted demand for oil and gas as automobile and plane travel declined sharply amid global lockdowns and other measures to contain the virus. Chevron has let its production slide due to the weakened demand, choosing to give priority to directing its cash flow to dividend payments. It reiterated Thursday its commitment to its dividend.\\nEven before the pandemic, the fossil-fuel industry was contending with an oversupply of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers, increased competition from renewable-energy sources and electric vehicles, while also contending with the prospect of increased climate-change regulation.\\nSince the end of last year, Chevron has been implementing a year-long restructuring in response to an anticipated period of prolonged low commodity prices. It is in the process of cutting up to 15% of its 45,000-person staff.\\nIn July, Chevron agreed to acquire Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, one of the larger energy deals this year. Chevron didn't say Thursday how much of its capital spending would be directed to Noble's assets. It previously said it expects about $300 million in annual cost savings from integrating Noble.\\nPaul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research, said Chevron's capital cuts are significant, especially because Noble wasn't factored into the prior spending guidance. Still, Mr. Sankey said Chevron is in a better position than many of its peers. \\\"Chevron came into 2020 best prepared in terms of capex and balance sheet, and leaves 2020 in best shape,\\\" he said.\\nChevron said it would increase investments in its stronger assets, including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. shale, including in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. It also said it would invest $300 million in projects related to a transition to a lower-carbon-energy economy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"URL\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chevron-slash-capital-spending/docview/2466698861/se-2?accountid=7064\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the net assets available for benefits of the Plans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the changes in net assets available for benefits for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\\nBasis for Opinion\\n \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Plans' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Plans' financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Plans in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nReport on Supplemental Schedules \\nThe supplemental schedules of assets (held at end of year) as of December 31, 2019 have been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audits of the Plans' financial statements. The supplemental schedules are the responsibility of the Plans' management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the supplemental schedules reconcile to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable, and performing procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental schedules. In forming our opinion on the supplemental schedules, we evaluated whether the supplemental schedules, including their form and content, are presented in compliance with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. In our opinion, such schedules are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.\\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\nHouston, Texas\\nJune 23, 2020\\nWe have served as the auditor of the Plans since 2018.\\n1\\nEIN 36-1812780\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nSTATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS\\nDECEMBER 31, 2019\\nthousands of dollars\\nBP Employee\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 001)\\nBP Partnership\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 051)\\nBP DirectSave\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 052)\\nBPX Energy\\nEmployee Savings\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 100)\\nInvestment in the BP Master Trust for Employee Savings Plans\\n$\\n8,120,478\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n32,695\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,085\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n194,089\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNotes receivable from participants\\n64,768\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n552\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n2,363\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet assets available for benefits\\n$\\n8,185,246\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n33,247\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,085\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n196,452\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\\n2\\nEIN 36-1812780\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nSTATEMENTS OF NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS\\nDECEMBER 31, 2018\\nthousands of dollars\\nBP Employee\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 001)\\nBP Partnership\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 051)\\nBP DirectSave\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 052)\\nBPX Energy\\nEmployee Savings\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 100)\\nInvestment in the BP Master Trust for Employee Savings Plans\\n$\\n7,121,350\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n27,790\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,051\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n133,477\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNotes receivable from participants\\n66,616\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n525\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n1,599\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet assets available for benefits\\n$\\n7,187,966\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n28,315\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,051\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n135,076\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\\n3\\nEIN 36-1812780\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN NET ASSETS AVAILABLE FOR BENEFITS\\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019\\nthousands of dollars\\nBP Employee\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 001)\\nBP Partnership\\nSavings Plan\\n(Plan No. 051)\\nBP DirectSave\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 052)\\nBPX Energy\\nEmployee Savings\\nPlan\\n(Plan No. 100)\\nADDITIONS:\\nContributions:\\nParticipant contributions\\n$\\n237,123\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,955\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n14,357\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nCompany contributions\\n139,800\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n720\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n21,315\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nRollover contributions\\n36,430\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n290\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n8,426\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal contributions\\n413,353\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n2,965\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n44,098\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nInterest on notes receivable from participants\\n3,600\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n31\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n106\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet investment income \\u2013 BP Master Trust for Employee Savings Plans\\n1,315,254\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n5,421\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n111\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n31,438\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal additions\\n1,732,207\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n8,417\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n111\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n75,642\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nDEDUCTIONS:\\nBenefits paid to participants\\n734,681\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n3,481\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n71\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n14,249\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAdministrative expenses\\n246\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n4\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n6\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n17\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal deductions\\n734,927\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n3,485\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n77\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n14,266\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet increase in net assets during the year\\n997,280\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n4,932\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n34\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n61,376\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet assets available for benefits:\\nBeginning of year\\n7,187,966\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n28,315\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n1,051\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n135,076\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nEnd of year\\n$\\n8,185,246\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n33,247\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,085\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n196,452\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements.\\n4\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n1.\\u00a0\\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PLANS\\nThe accompanying financial statements comprise employee savings plans of BP Corporation North America Inc. (the \\u201cCompany\\u201d) that participate in the BP Master Trust for Employee Savings Plans (the \\u201cMaster Trust\\u201d). The Company is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BP p.l.c. (\\u201cBP\\u201d).\\nThe following description of the BP Employee Savings Plan, the BP Partnership Savings Plan, the BP DirectSave Plan and the BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan (the \\u201cPlans\\u201d) provides only general information. Participants should refer to the applicable Plan document and Summary Plan Description for additional information. The Plans are subject to and comply with the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\\u201cERISA\\u201d).\\nThe purpose of the Plans is to encourage eligible employees to regularly save part of their earnings and to assist them in accumulating additional financial security for their retirement. The Plans provide that both participant contributions and Company matching contributions be held in a trust by an independent trustee for the benefit of participating employees. All plan assets are held in the Master Trust. The trustee of the Master Trust is State Street Bank and Trust Company (\\u201cState Street\\u201d).\\nFidelity Workplace Services, LLC (\\\"Fidelity\\\") is the recordkeeper for the Plans. The Company is the Plan sponsor and the Company\\u2019s Head of Pensions and Benefits, Americas is the Plan Administrator for the Plans.\\nGeneral\\nBP Employee Savings Plan\\nThe BP Employee Savings Plan (\\u201cESP\\u201d) was established on July 1, 1955. Generally, an employee of the Company (or a participating affiliate) is eligible to participate in ESP immediately upon the date of hire. Employees who are represented by a labor organization that has bargained for and agreed to the provisions of ESP are also eligible.\\nUnder ESP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to Internal Revenue Service (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable plan year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. A specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 7 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into ESP representing distributions from other qualified plans.\\nThe Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 7 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65).\\nParticipants may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.\\nThe benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $2,017,731 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $199,254 and $68,955, respectively.\\nBP Partnership Savings Plan\\nThe BP Partnership Savings Plan (\\u201cPSP\\u201d) was established on April 1, 1988. Certain salaried employees of the Company who are associated with the Company\\u2019s retail operations and employees of Global Business Services Americas are eligible to participate in PSP immediately upon the date of hire.\\n5\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nUnder PSP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable plan year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. \\nA specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 3 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into PSP representing distributions from other qualified plans. \\nThe Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 3 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65).\\nParticipants may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.\\nThe benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $21,700 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $1,625 and $132, respectively.\\nBP DirectSave Plan\\nThe BP DirectSave Plan (\\u201cDSP\\u201d) was established on April 1, 1988. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are employees at Company-operated retail locations are eligible to participate in the Plan after six months of service. Currently, there are no active employees contributing to the Plan.\\nUnder DSP, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. The Company makes matching contributions to the participant\\u2019s account equal to $0.50 for each $1.00 of employee contributions up to 4 percent of eligible compensation, as defined under the Plan, each pay period. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into DSP representing distributions from other qualified plans.\\nA participant may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.\\nThe benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Vesting in Company matching contribution accounts occurs at 25 percent after two years of vesting service and 100 percent after three years of\\n \\nvesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the 2019 plan year, $6,030 was used to pay eligible plan expenses. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $125,735 and $128,893, respectively.\\nBPX Energy Employee Savings Plan\\nThe BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan (\\u201cBPX\\u201d) was established on January 1, 2015. Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries who are working in the BPX Energy unit are eligible to participate in the Plan. Participants were previously eligible to participate in ESP. Account balances may be moved from ESP to BPX at the participant\\u2019s direction. Effective November 1, 2018, the Company\\u2019s Lower 48 business unit changed its name to BPX Energy. Effective the same date, the Plan name was changed to BPX Energy Employee Savings Plan.\\n6\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nUnder BPX, participating employees may contribute up to 80 percent of their qualified pay on a pre-tax, after-tax and/or Roth 401(k) basis, subject to IRS limits. Participants who attain the age of 50 before the end of the applicable year are eligible to make additional elective deferrals (catch-up contributions), subject to IRS limits. A specified portion of the employee contribution, up to a maximum of 7 percent of compensation, as defined under the Plan, is matched each pay period by the Company. Participants are permitted to rollover amounts into BPX representing distributions from other qualified plans.\\nThe Company will contribute as soon as reasonably possible to the Master Trust a nonelective employer contribution each pay period. The contribution will be allocated to the account of each participant who is an active participant during such pay period. The amount for investment is equal to 7 percent of such participant\\u2019s compensation during such pay period provided, however, that nonelective employer contributions made with respect to a calendar year on behalf of a participant may not exceed the IRS limitations.\\nThe Plan includes an auto-enrollment provision whereby all eligible new hires and rehires are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless they affirmatively elect not to participate. Automatically enrolled participants have their pre-tax deferral rate set at 7 percent of eligible compensation and their contributions invested in a target date fund nearest the employee\\u2019s retirement date (assumed to be at age 65).\\n \\nA participant may convert eligible assets into Roth 401(k) accounts within the Plan.\\nThe benefit to which a participant is entitled is the benefit that can be provided by the participant\\u2019s vested account balance. Participants are immediately and fully vested in their participant contribution accounts. Full vesting in the nonelective and Company matching contribution accounts occurs with three years of vesting service. The Plan may use forfeitures to reduce future Company matching contributions or to pay plan expenses. During the  2019 plan year, $388,122 was used to reduce Company matching contributions. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, forfeited non-vested accounts totaled $38,790 and $2,131, respectively.\\nInvestment Options\\nInvestment options offered under the Plans include target date funds, equity and fixed-income (bond) index funds, a short-term investment fund, a stable value investment option (\\\"Income Fund\\\") and BP American Depository Shares (\\u201cBP ADS\\u201d) (the BP Stock Fund). The Income Fund invests in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts (\\\"Synthetic Guaranteed Investment Contracts\\\") that simulate the performance of a Guaranteed Investment Contract, whereby participants execute plan transactions at contract value.\\nParticipants may change the percentage they contribute and the investment direction of their contributions daily. Company contributions are made in the form of cash contributions and are invested in funds selected by participants. \\nParticipants may elect to sell any portion of their investment fund(s) and reinvest the proceeds in one or more of the other available investment alternatives. Except where the fund provider, the recordkeeper, or the Plan has restrictions or takes discretionary action responsive to frequent trading or market timing concerns, there are no restrictions on the number of transactions a participant may authorize during the year.\\nAdministrative Expenses/Fund Management Fees\\nFees related to the administration of participant loans and overnight delivery charges are deducted from the applicable participant\\u2019s account. All reasonable and necessary administrative expenses are paid out of the Master Trust or paid by the Company. Generally, fees and expenses related to investment management of each investment option are paid out of the respective funds. As a result, the returns on those investments are net of the investment management fees. The Plans offer a managed accounts service to participants, which is an investment management service provided by Fidelity. Advisory fees related to this service are paid by participants who elect to participate.\\n7\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nPayment of Benefits\\nParticipants may elect to receive in-service withdrawals subject to various restrictions as described in the applicable Plan document.\\n \\nUpon termination of employment, a participant may elect to receive his or her vested account balance in a lump-sum payment or in installments. A participant may also elect to defer receipt of his or her vested account balance, partially or wholly, to a later date.\\nNotes Receivable from Participants\\nExcept for DSP, participants are eligible to borrow from their account balances in the Plans. Loans are made in the form of cash and the amount may not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of the market value of the total vested participant\\u2019s account or $50,000 less the participant\\u2019s highest loan balance outstanding during the preceding 12 months. Interest rates charged on unpaid balances are fixed for the duration of the loan. The interest rate charged is determined by the Plan Administrator based on the prevailing rates charged on similar commercial loans. Repayment of loan principal and interest is generally made by payroll deductions which are credited to the participant\\u2019s account.\\nPlan Termination\\nAlthough it has not expressed any intention to do so, the Company has the right under the Plans to discontinue its contributions at any time and to terminate the Plans subject to the provisions set forth in ERISA. In the event of a plan termination, participants would become 100 percent vested in their Company matching contribution accounts.\\n2\\n.\\u00a0\\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nBasis of Accounting.\\n The financial statements of the Plans are prepared under the accrual method of accounting in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d).\\nUse of Estimates.\\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\\nPayment of Benefits. \\nBenefits are recorded when paid.\\nTransfers. \\nEligibility requirements differ from Plan to Plan. If a participant becomes eligible for a different plan within the Company\\u2019s control group, the participant is permitted to transfer balances from the old Plan to the new Plan at any time. Plan transfers are accounted for in the statement of changes in net assets available for benefits.\\nExcess Contributions Payable. \\nThe Plans are required to return contributions received during the Plan year in excess of the Internal Revenue Code (\\u201cIRC\\u201d) limits.\\nNew Accounting Pronouncement. \\nIn February\\u00a02017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-06, \\nPlan Accounting: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (Topic 960), Defined Contribution Pension Plans\\n \\n(Topic 962), Health and Welfare Benefit Plans (Topic 965): Employee Benefit Plan Master Trust Reporting\\n (\\u201cASU 2017-06\\u201d). ASU 2017-06 clarifies the presentation requirements for a plan\\u2019s interest in a master trust and requires more detailed disclosures of a plan\\u2019s interest in a master trust. ASU 2017-06 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December\\u00a015, 2018, with retrospective application to all periods presented. Management has adopted this new guidance in the current year.\\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, \\nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820)\\n (\\u201cASU 2018-13\\u201d). ASU 2018-13 eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for entities for fiscal years beginning after December\\u00a015, 2019, with retrospective application to all periods presented. Early application is permitted. Management is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2018-13.\\n8\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nInvestment Valuation and Income Recognition.\\n All investment assets held by the Master Trust (except for the Income Fund) are stated at fair value. Further information regarding the techniques used to measure the fair value of investment assets held by the Master Trust is detailed in Note 6 (Fair Value Measurements).\\nIn connection with the Income Fund, the Master Trust invests in fully benefit-responsive investment contracts also known as Synthetic Guarantee Investment Contracts. See Note 5 (Master Trust). The Synthetic Guaranteed Investment Contracts are measured at contract value. Contract value is the relevant measurement attributable to fully benefit-responsive investment contracts, as contract value is the amount participants would receive if they were to initiate permitted transactions under the terms of the Plans.\\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividends are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Net appreciation (depreciation) includes the Plan\\u2019s gains and losses on investments bought and sold as well as held during the year.\\nNotes Receivable from Participants.\\n Notes receivable from participants represent participant loans that are recorded at their unpaid principal balance plus any accrued but unpaid interest. Interest income on notes receivable from participants is recorded when it is earned. Related fees are recorded as administrative expenses and are expensed when they are incurred. No allowance for credit losses has been recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. If a participant ceases to make loan repayments and the Plan Administrator deems the participant loan to be a distribution, the participant loan balance is reduced and a benefit payment is recorded. \\n3.\\u00a0\\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS\\nThe Plans have received determination letters from the IRS (dated as shown below) stating that the Plans are qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC and, therefore, the related trust is exempt from taxation.\\nPlan\\nDate\\nESP\\nJuly 1, 2016\\nPSP\\nApril 19, 2016\\nDSP\\nApril 19, 2016\\nBPX\\nApril 19, 2016\\nOnce qualified, the Plans are required to operate in conformity with the IRC in order to maintain their qualification. During the Plan year, the Plans experienced certain minor operational issues. To ensure the Plans remain qualified, the Plan Administrator is in the process of correcting these minor errors in accordance with the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS). The Plan Administrator has indicated that it will take the necessary steps, if any, to bring the Plans\\u2019 operations into compliance with the IRC.\\nU.S. GAAP requires plan management to evaluate tax positions taken by the Plans. The financial statement effects of a tax position are recognized when the position is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, to be sustained upon examination by the IRS. Plan management has analyzed the tax positions taken by the Plans and has concluded that as of December\\u00a031, 2019, there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken. The Plans have recognized no interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Plans are subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions. There are no audits for any tax periods in progress. The Plan Administrator believes the Plans are no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2016.\\n4.\\u00a0\\nRISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\\nInvestment securities held in the Master Trust are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market risks and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect participants\\u2019 account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits. \\n9\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus (or \\u201cCOVID-19\\u201d) has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, the values of investment securities have declined significantly. These economic and market conditions and other effects of the COVID-19 outbreak may continue to adversely affect the Plans. The extent of the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Plans\\u2019 participants\\u2019 account balances and the amounts reported in the statements of net assets available for benefits cannot be predicted at this time.\\nIncluded in investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, are shares of BP ADS of $1,025 million and $1,068 million, respectively. This investment represents 12.28 percent and 14.66 percent of total investments at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A significant decline in the market value of the BP ADS would significantly affect the net assets available for benefits.\\n5\\n.\\u00a0\\nMASTER TRUST\\nThe purpose of the Master Trust is the collective investment of assets of the Plans. Each Plan\\u2019s interest in the Master Trust is based on account balances of the participants and their elected investment options. The Master Trust assets are allocated among the Plans by assigning to each Plan those transactions (primarily contributions, benefit payments and plan-specific expenses) that can be specifically identified and by allocating among all Plans, in proportion to the fair value of the assets assigned to each Plan, income and expenses resulting from the collective investment of the assets of the Master Trust.\\nInvestment income and administrative expenses related to the Master Trust are allocated to the individual Plans on a daily basis based on each participant\\u2019s account balance within each investment fund option.\\nFully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts\\n. In connection with the Income Fund, the Master Trust enters into contracts that meet fully benefit-responsive investment contract criteria and therefore are reported at contract value. Contract value represents contributions made under each contract, plus earnings, less participant withdrawals and administrative expenses. The Master Trust\\u2019s interest in these contracts represents the maximum potential credit loss from concentrations of credit risk associated with its investment. \\nThe contracts provide for the payment of a stated interest crediting rate for a specified period of time. The underlying fixed income assets that support the interest crediting rate are owned by the Master Trust. Under the contracts, investment gains and losses on the underlying assets are not reflected immediately in the interest crediting rate. Rather, the gains and losses are amortized, usually over time to maturity or the duration of the underlying assets, through adjustments to future interest crediting rates. These adjustments generally result in contract value, over time, converging with the market value of the underlying fixed income assets. Factors affecting future interest crediting rates include the current yield, duration and the existing difference between market value of the underlying fixed income assets and contract value. Interest crediting rates, which cannot be less than zero percent, are generally reset monthly. The issuers of the contracts guarantee that all qualified participant withdrawals occur at contract value, subject to certain limitations described below.\\nContract termination occurs whenever the contract value or market value of the underlying assets reaches zero or upon certain events of default. If the contract terminates due to a contract issuer default or if the market value of the underlying portfolio reaches zero, the contract issuer will generally be required to pay any excess contract value at the date of termination. If the Plans default in their obligation under the agreements and the default is not cured within the time permitted, the Plans will receive the market value as of the date of termination. Contract termination also may occur by either party upon election and notice.\\n10\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nCertain events may limit the ability of the Plans to transact at contract value with an issuer. Such events include (i) amendments to Plan documents or the Plans\\u2019 administration (including complete or partial plan termination or merger with another plan); (ii) changes to the Plans\\u2019 prohibition on competing investment options or deletion of equity wash provisions; (iii) the failure of the Plans or the Master Trust to qualify for exemption from federal income taxes or any required prohibited transaction exemption under ERISA; (iv) bankruptcy of the Plan sponsor or other Plan sponsor event (for example, divestitures or spin-offs of a subsidiary) that cause a significant withdrawal from the Plans; and (v) the delivery of any communication to plan participants designed to influence a participant\\u2019s behavior in the investment option. At this time, management does not believe that the occurrence of any such event, which would limit the Plans\\u2019 ability to transact at contract value with participants, is probable.\\nIn addition, certain events allow the issuer to terminate the contracts with the Plans and settle at an amount different from contract value. Those events may be different under each contract. Such events may include (i) an uncured violation of the Plans\\u2019 investment guidelines; (ii) a breach of material obligation under the contract; (iii) a material misrepresentation; and (iv) a material amendment to the agreements without the consent of the issuer.\\nPlans\\u2019 Interest in Master Trust. \\nThe Plans have a divided interest in the investments held in the Master Trust since each Plan\\u2019s interest is based on the account balances of the participants and their elected investment options. Each Plan\\u2019s beneficial interest in the underlying investment options does not vary significantly from each Plan\\u2019s beneficial interest in the total net assets of the Master Trust.\\nThe net assets of the Master Trust and the Plans' interest in the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2019, are as follows:\\nNET ASSETS\\nthousands of dollars\\nMaster Trust\\nESP's Interest in Master

\\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\\n, establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below.\\nLevel 1 \\ninputs are observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\\nLevel 2 \\ninputs are observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included within Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable at the reporting date.\\n13\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nLevel 3 \\ninputs are unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data, and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management\\u2019s best estimate of fair value.\\nIn measuring fair value, the Plans and the Master Trust use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The valuation techniques used by the Plans and Master Trust are summarized as follows:\\nBP Stock Fund.\\n A unitized stock fund operates similarly to a mutual fund, in that they are composed of stock, and a small percentage of cash or another short-term interest-bearing vehicle. The inclusion of cash provides liquid assets to allow for the daily processing of transfers, loans, and withdrawals. The value of a unit in a unitized stock fund is based on the Net Asset Value (\\u201cNAV\\u201d), which is the value of the underlying BP ADS and the cash vehicle held by the fund, less any fees, divided by the number of units outstanding. Therefore, the NAV of the fund (the \\u201cunit price\\u201d) will be different from the closing price of the underlying stock on the applicable exchange. The individual assets of a stock fund are generally considered separately as individual investments for accounting and financial statement reporting purposes and have been reported in this manner as BP ADS and Short Term Investment Fund.\\nCommon/Collective Trust Funds. \\nCommon/collective trust funds are valued using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. \\nMoney Market Fund\\n. The money market fund is valued at fair value using published market prices.\\nThe preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Plans and Master Trust believe their valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\\nThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of the investments held by the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2019 (\\nin thousands\\n):\\nPrices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\\n(Level 1)\\nObservable\\n(Level 2)\\nUnobservable\\n(Level 3)\\nTotal\\nBP ADS\\n$\\n1,025,421\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,025,421\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nMoney market fund\\n46,182\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n46,182\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal investments, at fair value\\n$\\n1,071,603\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,071,603\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nInvestments measured at NAV:\\nShort term investment fund (a)\\n$\\n421,395\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nU.S. equity funds (b)\\n2,522,154\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNon-U.S. equity funds (b)\\n441,853\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nU.S. bond funds (c)\\n426,881\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNon-U.S. bond funds (d)\\n32,299\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTarget date funds (e)\\n3,024,306\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nOther (f)\\n33,208\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal investments, at NAV\\n6,902,096\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal\\n$\\n7,973,699\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n14\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe following table presents, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the fair value of the investments held by the Master Trust as of December\\u00a031, 2018 (\\nin thousands\\n):\\nPrices in Active Markets for Identical Assets\\n(Level 1)\\nObservable\\n(Level 2)\\nUnobservable\\n(Level 3)\\nTotal\\nBP ADS\\n$\\n1,068,040\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,068,040\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nMoney market fund\\n46,461\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n46,461\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal investments, at fair value\\n$\\n1,114,501\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,114,501\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nInvestments measured at NAV:\\nShort term investment fund (a)\\n$\\n441,925\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nU.S. equity funds (b)\\n2,017,795\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNon-U.S. equity funds (b)\\n385,314\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nU.S. bond funds (c)\\n330,902\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNon-U.S. bond funds (d)\\n33,281\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTarget date funds (e)\\n2,559,399\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nOther (f)\\n25,196\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal investments, at NAV\\n5,793,812\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nTotal\\n$\\n6,908,313\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n(a)\\nShort-term investment funds invest in short-term fixed-income securities and other securities with debt-like characteristics emphasizing short-term maturities and high quality. Under normal circumstances, there are no redemption restrictions; redemptions can be made daily with no notice period required.

Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.\\n(d)\\nNon-U.S. bond common/collective trust funds seek to provide investment returns of a diversified portfolio of international government bonds and match the performance of an index. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.\\n(e)\\nTarget date common/collective trust funds are pre-mixed portfolios of diversified assets (stocks, bonds and other investments). They are designed for participants who expect to retire in or close to the target year stated in each option\\u2019s name. With the exception of the Target Date Retirement Fund, over time, the portfolio mix of each fund will gradually shift to more fixed income securities as the target year approaches. Upon reaching the target year, the fund will be blended into the Target Date Retirement Fund, which is designed to provide those participants who are withdrawing money from the Plan with an appropriate blend of growth, income and inflation protection. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 3 days.\\n(f)\\nOther common/collective trust funds seek to offer a diversified exposure to inflation-sensitive securities including U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (\\u201cTIPS\\u201d), commodities and global real estate to help hedge against inflation. Under normal circumstances, redemptions for participant activity may be made daily with no notice period required. Plan sponsor-initiated activity may require prior written notice of 15 days.\\n15\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe above provides a general description of the investments. Participants should refer to the Investment Options Guide for information on the investment objectives and strategy of each investment option.\\nTransfers between Levels.\\n The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. In such instances, the transfer is reported at the beginning of the reporting period.\\nThe significance of transfers between levels is evaluated based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transfers between levels.\\n7.\\u00a0\\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND EXEMPT PARTY-IN-INTEREST TRANSACTIONS\\nCertain of the Master Trust investments are managed by the investment division of State Street and by Fidelity Management and Research Company, an affiliate of the Plans\\u2019 recordkeeper. The BP Stock Fund holds investments in BP ADS. Purchases and sales of BP ADS during 2019 amounted to $270 million and $310 million, respectively. These transactions qualify as exempt party-in-interest transactions under ERISA. The BP ADS held within the BP Stock Fund earned dividends of $67 million for the year ended December\\u00a031, 2019.\\nThe Plans also issue loans to participants, which are secured by the vested balances in the participants' accounts.\\n8\\n.\\u00a0\\nRECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO FORM 5500\\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Plans\\u2019 net assets available for benefits per the financial statements to the Form 5500 \\n(in thousands)\\n:\\nDecember 31, 2019\\nESP\\nPSP\\nDSP\\nBPX\\nNet assets available for benefits as stated in the financial statements\\n$\\n8,185,246\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n33,247\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,085\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n196,452\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAdjustment from contract value to fair value for fully benefit responsive investment contracts\\n6,905\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n19\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n5\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n37\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet assets available for benefits as stated in the Form 5500\\n$\\n8,192,151\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n33,266\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,090\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n196,489\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nDecember 31, 2018\\nESP\\nPSP\\nDSP\\nBPX\\nNet assets available for benefits as stated in the financial statements\\n$\\n7,187,966\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n28,315\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,051\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n135,076\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAdjustment from contract value to fair value for fully benefit responsive investment contracts\\n(3,750)\\n\\u00a0\\n(10)\\n\\u00a0\\n(3)\\n\\u00a0\\n(20)\\n\\u00a0\\nNet assets available for benefits as stated in the Form 5500\\n$\\n7,184,216\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n28,305\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n1,048\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n135,056\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n16\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nThe following is a reconciliation of the Plans\\u2019 net increase in net assets per the financial statements to the net income per the Form 5500 \\n(in thousands)\\n:\\nYear End December 31, 2019\\nESP\\nPSP\\nDSP\\nBPX\\nNet increase in net assets per the financial statements\\n$\\n997,280\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n4,932\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n34\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n61,376\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAdjustment from contract value to fair value for fully benefit responsive investment contracts at December 31, 2019\\n6,905\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n19\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n5\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n37\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nAdjustment from contract value to fair value for fully benefit responsive investment contracts at December 31, 2018\\n3,750\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n10\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n3\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n20\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nNet income per the Form 5500\\n$\\n1,007,935\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n4,961\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n42\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n61,433\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nThe following is a reconciliation of benefits paid to participants per the financial statements to the Form 5500 \\n(in thousands)\\n:\\nYear End December 31, 2019\\nESP\\nPSP\\nDSP\\nBPX\\nBenefits paid to participants per the financial statements\\n$\\n734,681\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n3,481\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n71\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n14,249\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nLess: Certain deemed distributions of participant loans\\n(98)\\n\\u00a0\\n(2)\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u2014\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n(15)\\n\\u00a0\\nBenefits paid to participants per Form 5500\\n$\\n734,583\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n3,479\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n71\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n$\\n14,234\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n9\\n.\\u00a0\\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\\nSubsequent to December\\u00a031, 2019, COVID-19 has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the macro-economic environment and global economy. Due to the disruption of the virus on the global economy, the values of investment securities have declined significantly and may continue to be adversely affected. \\nAdditionally, subsequent to the Plans\\u2019 year end, oil prices have declined significantly, which has also negatively impacted the BP ADS share price.\\nWhile the COVID-19 outbreak and depressed oil prices have negatively impacted global financial markets, and specifically the BP ADS share price, the Company does not believe there is substantial doubt about the Plans\\u2019 ability to continue as a going concern. The Company believes the Plan Administrator could continue to carry on the administrative functions of the Plans for at least the period of one year from the date of this report.\\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was passed by Congress. The CARES Act provides immediate and temporary relief for retirement plan sponsors and their participants respective to employer contributions, distributions and participant loans. Utilization of the provisions included within the CARES Act are optional and may be effective and operationalized immediately, prior to amending the plan document. The Plans have implemented certain distribution and loan relief provisions and management intends to amend the Plans timely.\\n17\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\\nSchedule H, Line 4i \\u2013 Schedule of Assets (Held at End of Year)\\nDecember\\u00a031, 2019\\nIdentity of Issue, Borrower, Lessor, Similar Party\\nDescription of Investment Including Maturity Date, Rate of Interest, Collateral, Par, Maturity Value\\nCost\\nCurrent Value\\nBP Employee Savings Plan\\n(Plan No.001)\\n* Participant loans\\n3.25% - 10.50%\\nN/A\\n$\\n64,768,048\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nBP Partnership Savings Plan\\n(Plan No.051)\\n* Participant loans\\n4.25% - 6.50%\\nN/A\\n$\\n552,337\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\nBPX Energy Employee Savings Plan\\n(Plan No.100)\\n* Participant loans\\n4.25% - 6.50%\\nN/A\\n$\\n2,362,608\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0\\n* \\nIndicates party-in-interest.\\n18\\nSIGNATURE\\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the trustees (or other persons who administer the respective employee benefit plans) have duly caused this annual report to be signed on their behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.\\nBP EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN\\nDate: June 23, 2020\\nBy Plan Administrator\\n/s/ Clifford E.
