      "So the question is on the Permian. You had a very strong production number in Q4, quite an inflection\n",

      "So through the -- through a year, the quarterly ups and downs on some of these things can create some\n",

      "We had more POPs. We -- because we had faster drilling and faster cycle time on completions, we had a\n",

      "our DUC inventory because drilling performance was so strong.\n",
      "A couple of other things. POPs in the fourth quarter were weighted towards New Mexico. We had guided\n",
      "towards activity that would lead to more POPs in New Mexico in the second half of the year. Those wells\n",
      "are more productive than kind of on average than the rest of the portfolio. So that flows through.\n",

      "And we've already clarified what you can expect this year with the 8% increase that we've announced.\n",
      "And then I would point you back towards our upside and downside guidance that we've had out there now\n",
      "for a number of years. $10 billion to $20 billion on the range for buybacks. And that's in an upside price\n",

      "That's the whole point. We're trying to be steady across the commodity cycle. We've heard from investors\n",
