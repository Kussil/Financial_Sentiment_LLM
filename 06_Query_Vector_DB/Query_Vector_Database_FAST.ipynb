Production & Operations\\nG. Birrell\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY: BP aims to pivot its business towards becoming an integrated energy company with\\na focus on delivering solutions for customers. To do so, the firm will pursue growth in three focus areas (i)\\nlow carbon electricity and energy (EBITDA target of $2-3 billion by 2030): building scale in renewables and Board Members\\nbioenergy, seeking early positions in hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage, and building out A. J. Blanc M. Auchincloss\\na customer gas portfolio to complement these low carbon energies; (ii) convenience and mobility (EBITDA\\nH. Lund M. B.

Pai\\nproduction is anticipated to decline by 25% relative to 2019.\\nK. A. Richardson T. Morzaria\\nFor its financial framework, BP allocated $16 billion for capex in 2023 (including inorganic capex) and\\nintends to keep its annual capex in a range of $14-18 billion through 2030, while targeting over $25 billion\\nof divestments. Financial discipline will remain its focus, as it aims to maintain organic cash flow break-even Domicile Auditor\\nat Brent oil price of around $40/bbl, RMM of USD11/bbl, and Henry Hub of $3/mmBtu. Overall, the strategic United Kingdom Deloitte & Touche LLP\\nplan should lead to a return on average capital employed (ROACE) of around >18% by 2025, with EBITDA per\\nFounded\\nshare growing at a CAGR of >12% throughout the period. Shareholders, meanwhile, will be rewarded with a\\n1908\\n4% annual increase in DPS and share buybacks, where BP expects to be around $4 billion per annum\\nthrough 2025 with Brent oil price at $60/bbl. Employees\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: After being hit by the industry downturn during 2020, BP\\u2019s underlying profits 67,600\\n(replacement cost basis) recovered to $12.8 billion in 2021 and further soared to $27.7 billion in 2022,\\nStockholders\\nunderpinned by exceptionally high oil & gas price realization and stronger refining margins. This is\\n207,383\\naccompanied by a strong improvement in operating cash flow which jumped to $40.9 billion in 2022 from\\n$23.6 billion. Coupled with proceeds from asset divestments, BP\\u2019s balance sheet strength has improved with\\nnet gearing reduced to 20% in 2022 from 25% in 2021, enabling the group to raise its cash returns to\\nshareholders.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Spark!Lab is an experiential learning and activity space \\u2013 developed by the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center \\u2013 that provides children and young people with opportunities to invent, design, collaborate, and find solutions to real-world problems, equipping them with STEM skills that can ultimately help them build careers in creative industries. Together with ConocoPhillips Qatar, QF and the Lemelson Center created a pop-up Spark!Lab at Education City during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021\\u2122, where young participants worked together on innovations themed around accessibility and sport. Spark!Lab will be back at QF at the end of the year, before and during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\\u2122, after which the partnership seeks to build a permanent Spark!Lab within Education City Stadium post-tournament. The partnership will also make invention education learning materials globally available in the Arabic language. \\u201cWelcoming Spark!Lab to Education City, which has been made possible through our long-term strategic partnership with the Smithsonian Institution and ConocoPhillips Qatar\\u2019s support, reflects QF\\u2019s commitment to providing our youth with new and engaging opportunities to explore, discover, grow, and become lifelong learners,\\u201d said Machaille Hassan Al-Naimi, President of Community Development, Qatar Foundation. \\u201cWe believe in both the importance of accessibility and inclusivity, and the power of sport, in building strong, healthy, vibrant communities, and it has been wonderful to see children and young people produce amazing, inventive solutions to real-life challenges based on these themes at the pop-up Spark!Lab. \\u201cTo see them embracing the invention education opportunities that Spark!Lab offers makes us really excited for its return in 2022, the opportunities that it will offer youth in Qatar beyond the World Cup, and the invention education resources in the Arabic language that will be made possible through this partnership. We look forward to seeing our work with the Smithsonian Institution continuing to go from strength to strength, as together we open up new pathways for youth to realize their potential.\\u201d Arthur Daemmrich, Director of the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, said: \\u201cIt has been inspiring to see young people in Qatar embrace inventive identities. \\u201cTheir willingness to tackle challenges that use both familiar and novel materials and to create physical prototypes while practicing 21st Century skills of risk-taking, perseverance, and creative problem solving bodes well for the future of Qatar and the world. \\u201cWe have been fortunate to have such engaged collaborators in Qatar Foundation and ConocoPhillips Qatar, which has made it possible to carry out our most successful international Spark!Lab to date. Continuing to develop new activities that relate to innovations in Qatar while benefitting the world is an exciting next step for us.\\u201d \\u201cOur future relies on the next generation of inventors, as our communities and industries will need their ideas to solve challenges and power our economies. Spark!Lab plays an invaluable role inspiring children to become leaders in STEM fields, encouraging them to foster lifelong passions for science and engineering,\\u201d said Todd Creeger, President of ConocoPhillips Qatar. \\u201cWe are proud to partner with the Smithsonian Institution and Qatar Foundation, two leading entities in the fields of education and scientific research, to bring this unique initiative to Qatar.

Today, Shell is one of T. Huysinga (44 80 0731 8888)\\nthe world\\u2019s largest integrated oil and gas companies with operations in more than 70 countries and is widely\\nconsidered to be one of the seven oil supermajors. Shell is primarily listed on the London Stock Exchange Office\\nwith secondary listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is a Shell Centre, 2 York Road, London, Greater London, SE1\\nconstituent of FTSE 100 Index. As of February 12, 2021, The Capital Group is effectively the largest 7NA\\nshareholder with a 5% stake in the firm.\\nTelephone\\nDIVISIONAL OVERVIEW: Shell has five reporting segments \\u2013 Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products,\\n44 80 0731 8888\\nChemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas (45% of 2021 normalized earnings) business focuses on liquefying\\nnatural gas (LNG) for transportation to customers around the world. The company is a global LNG leader Fax\\nwith sales of 64 million tons in 2021, and has some of the world\\u2019s largest and most technologically N/A\\nadvanced liquefaction/regasification plants located in more than 10 countries. The business also includes\\nGas-to-Liquids (GTL) operation that converts natural gas into liquid products, as well as New Energies Website\\nportfolio that encompasses Shell\\u2019s interests in new transportation fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen, and www.shell.com\\nelectric vehicle charging.\\nUpstream operations (41% of 2021 normalized earnings) mainly involve Exploration & Production activities Officers\\nthat search for and recover oil and natural gas around the world. Many of these activities are carried out as CEO & Director Independent Chairman of\\njoint venture partnerships, often with national oil companies. It has net proved hydrocarbon reserves of B.

Lim\\nDespite the improvement in market environment, Shell\\u2019s capital allocation plan remains conservative in our\\nview. It will retain annual capex in the range of USD19-22 billion and keep underlying opex at below USD35\\nDomicile Auditor\\nbillion. At the same time, it will continue divesting non-strategic assets at an annual average of around\\nUnited Kingdom Ernst & Young LLP\\nUSD4 billion to high-grade its portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders will still be rewarded by progressive\\ndividend growth of around 4% each year, as well as additional cash return via share buybacks that will bring Founded\\ntotal shareholders distributions to around 20-30% of cash flow from operations. 1907\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: Shell\\u2019s financial performance recovered in 2021 with adjusted earnings nearly\\nEmployees\\nquadrupled Y/Y to USD19.3 billion, leading to a sharp rebound in return on average capital employed to 8.5%\\n82,000\\nfrom 2.9% in prior year. Coupled with sustained capital and cost discipline, free cash flow close to doubled\\nand net gearing was reduced to 23.1% by the end of 2021.

Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of greater than one year. Payments that are not fixed at the commencement of the lease are considered variable and are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability calculations. In the measurement of our ROU assets and lease liabilities, the fixed lease payments in the agreement are discounted using a secured incremental borrowing rate for a term similar to the duration of the lease, as our leases do not provide implicit rates. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.9Table of Contents\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU assets and lease liabilities of approximately $2.81 billion and $2.90 billion, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially impact our consolidated statements of income, cash flows or equity as a result of adoption. As a lessor under ASC 842, MPLX may be required to re-classify existing operating leases to sales-type leases upon modification and related reassessment of the leases. If such a modification were to occur, it may result in the de-recognition of existing assets, recognition of a receivable in the amount of the present value of fixed payments expected to be received by MPLX under the lease, and recognition of a corresponding gain or loss in the period of change. MPLX will evaluate the impact of a lease reassessment as modifications occur.We also adopted the following ASUs during the first six months of 2019, none of which had a material impact to our financial statements or financial statement disclosures:Not Yet AdoptedASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, the recognition of an impairment charge is calculated based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\\u2019s fair value, which could be different from the amount calculated under the current method using the implied fair value of the goodwill; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.\",\n          \"CVX\\u2019s trailing-12-month free cash flow stood at $13.2 billion at the end of 2019, the lowest level since the\\nsecond quarter of 2018.
