While they will work together on notable large projects, they're still competitors who look out for their shareholders' interests. They're currently engaged in a court battle over Chevron's proposed acquisition of Hess, one of Exxon's partners in Guyana. They also routinely benchmark their metrics against each other and rival integrated energy companies.\\n\\nWhile Chevron has edged its bigger rival in some areas, Exxon reigns supreme in others. One area where Exxon is much stronger than Chevron is its balance sheet. Because of that, it has greater financial flexibility, which could come in handy in the future.\\n\\nExxon's financial fortress\\n\\nExxon ended the first quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 16%. That's a low leverage ratio for the oil company. It's well below the company's targeted debt-to-capital range of 20%-25%.\\n\\nThat metric is even lower when factoring in Exxon's massive cash position. Exxon ended the first quarter with $33.3 billion of cash, an increase from $31.6 billion at the end of last year thanks to its strong free cash flow, and its requirement to pause share repurchases ahead of Pioneer Natural Resources' special meeting to vote on Exxon's pending acquisition. Add in its cash, and Exxon's net debt-to-capital ratio was a mere 3%.\\n\\nThe company has enough cash on its balance sheet to fund its dividend outlay of roughly $15 billion per year for two years. It could also fund its current capital spending range, which is $23 billion to $25 billion in 2024, for over a year. That gives the oil giant a lot of cushion. The company could use its cash balance to fund share repurchases during a period of lower oil prices or make an acquisition using cash.\\n\\nStrong, but not on Exxon's level\\n\\nChevron actually has a lower debt-to-capital ratio than Exxon, at 12%. However, it doesn't have anywhere near Exxon's cash position. Chevron's cash balance was $6.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $8.2 billion at the end of last year after the company outspent its operating cash flow on capital expenditures, dividends, and share repurchases, at $4 billion, $3 billion, and $3 billion, respectively. As a result, its net debt ratio was higher at 8.8%.\\n\\nThat's still a strong ratio. Like Exxon, Chevron's leverage target is 20% to 25%. With its net debt ratio well below that range, it has tremendous financial flexibility. For example, Chevron estimates that it can continue repurchasing shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range through 2027 at an average oil price in the $50 range in 2025-2027 while maintaining leverage within its target range.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nHowever, while Chevron has a solid cash position, it's nearing its minimum target of keeping $5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. It would have hit that level in the first quarter if it hadn't issued $1 billion of debt and raised $300 million in cash from asset sales and other sources.\\n\\nBecause Chevron has less cash than Exxon, it would need to issue more debt to fund future shortfalls between its cash flow and cash outlays. That would add to its interest expense. On the other hand, Exxon can use its massive cash balance to fund any shortfalls for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nExxon's cash war chest gives it more flexibility\\n\\nExxonMobil has a much stronger balance sheet than Chevron, thanks to its lower net debt ratio and massive cash position. It gives the oil company a much bigger cushion to weather a future downturn in the energy market. It could use its cash to fund capital projects, maintain its capital return rate, or make an opportunistic acquisition. While Chevron should weather a future storm just fine, it would need to use its balance sheet capacity. That could potentially limit its flexibility if the debt markets are in disarray. Because of that, Exxon is the better option for investors seeking a financial fortress in the oil patch.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in ExxonMobil right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in ExxonMobil, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and ExxonMobil wasn\\u2019t one of them.

              "'Talos Energy Inc. (NYSE:TALO) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript May 7, 2024\\n\\nTalos Energy Inc. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\\n\\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Talos Energy First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, May 7, 2024. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Clay Jeansonne. Thank you. Please go ahead.\\n\\nClay Jeansonne: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Tim Duncan, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sergio Maiworm, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. For our prepared remarks, we will refer to our first quarter 2024 earnings slide presentation, which is available for viewing and downloading on Talos’ website. Starting on Slide 2. Cautionary statements, I’d like to remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in yesterday’s press release and our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2024, filed yesterday with the SEC.\\n\\nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this call, we may present GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in yesterday’s press release, which was filed with the SEC and is available on our website. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Tim.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Thank you, Clay, and welcome aboard. We’re going to start this presentation on Slide 3. We’re going to discuss how we’ve repositioned ourselves over the last year with the last two M&A deals. We’re the Fourth Largest Acreage Holder in the Gulf of Mexico, and we’re the Fifth Largest Operator in the Gulf of Mexico. And we have two tenets to our strategy that we think are important. One, we focus on oil-weighted assets, and two, we think it’s critically important that we operate our deepwater infrastructure, and it allows us to focus our prospect inventory around this infrastructure and allows us to shorten our cycle times when we think about drilling these wells and getting them in first oil. Let’s go to Slide 4, and talk about what might have been one of our busiest quarters in the company’s history.\\n\\nWe ended the year by bringing on Venice and Lime Rock ahead of schedule and with sustained rates at over 18,000 barrels equivalent a day. And in January we announced the QuarterNorth transaction, our second transaction of over $1 billion in the last year, adding important scale to our business. Immediately after that transaction, we announced a couple of capital markets transactions, including lowering the cost capital of our debt by refinancing our high-yield notes. We were able to close the QuarterNorth transaction within 45 days, which helps us accelerate our synergies. We were also able to update our financial guidance, increasing our production guidance. And then later we also updated our debt guidance from $400 million to $550 million of debt repayments for the year.\\n\\nAlso within the quarter, we announced the divestiture of our CCS business to TotalEnergies. I’ll speak more about the importance of that transaction on the next slide. So on Page 5, we went through a lot of these highlights on Page 4. Let me focus on a couple of bullets on each side of this page. So first on the left side of the page, we had record production in the first quarter at the high end of our guidance, and you’re going to see this go up tremendously in the second quarter. And Sergio will talk about that later in the presentation. Some of these other bullets I just discussed, but let me focus a little bit on the sale of TLCS business. We’re bullish about what CCS can be long-term, but we did notice that emissions reductions were slowing down within these facilities and that capital requirements were going up.\\n\\nSo we thought the right move for us was to transact on this business. We got a solid return over two times our money and immediately take those proceeds and accelerate our debt repayment. As we get to the right side of the page and focus on what we’re trying to do from here, we think it’s important to continue to remind the market that even though we’re projecting 35% to 40% year-over-year increases to our total corporate production base, we’re doing that with a lower capital program relative to our Talos legacy business last year. And what Sergio is going to talk about later in the presentation is how that impacts the free cash flow yield of our business. I’m also going to talk about in this presentation why we’re so excited to get this drilling program going, particularly in the Katmai field, as we think it’s an enormous catalyst for our business.\\n\\nSo as we turn to Page 6, let’s hit some of the highlights of the quarter. We average 79,600 barrels equivalent a day, again on the high end of our expectations for the quarter. And you’ll see that number continue to go up as we own these QuarterNorth assets in full now for the rest of the year. We’re very much oil and liquids weighted. We had upstream EBITDA at $268 million for the quarter, which has a netback margin of $42 per BOE. Now, that doesn’t include workovers, which are heavy in the first quarter but will taper off through the rest of the year. Upstream CapEx was $112 million, and upstream adjusted free cash flow, not inclusive of some expenses that we still had in the first quarter related to TLCS was $78 million. Now, the sale of that TLCS business that I mentioned earlier allowed us to accelerate our debt reduction, and so we had debt repayments of $225 million for the quarter.\\n\\nThat also allowed us to reach our leverage goal of one times within the quarter. And so we should lower that continually throughout the year. As we move to Slide 7, one of the more important things about closing the QuarterNorth transaction as quickly as we were able to is it allows us to control two things. One, we can control the assets operationally, which is important as we plan to Katmai well, that I’m going to discuss later in the slide deck. The other thing is we can get to the work of the synergies. And in the first quarter, we immediately were able to work on synergies related to G&A, including personnel, and IT. In the second quarter, we’re going to work on the insurance-related synergies, and then you’ll also see some synergies that flow through operating costs.\\n\\nBut even so far, since we closed the transaction, we’re able to realize what will amount to $20 million of run rate synergies in the first quarter on our way to achieving $30 million by the end of the year and $55 million as we get into 2025. As we go on to Page 8, we can talk a little bit about the second quarter, it also relates to the first quarter. The second quarter is where we’ll have the HP-1 drydock in our Phoenix field, which includes our Tornado asset. We thought there would be a couple of days late in the first quarter, but ultimately that got delayed. So it’ll kind of be a clean 55 days within the second quarter. It’ll have an impact to the quarter of 5,000 to 6,000 barrels equivalent a day. Sergio will talk about broader patterns for the second quarter.\\n\\nJust a reminder, this is a dynamically positioned vessel that hosts several of the production from Phoenix and Tornado. So it has to go into drydock every 2.5 years. Let’s go to Page 9 and talk about the recent lease sale. Now the sale occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023, but ultimately you’re awarded these blocks in the first quarter of 2024. And we were able to achieve 17 blocks with high bids, all were awarded. It adds up to 95,000 acres. But I think if I focus you on the map, it’s important to play through how this fits our strategy that I referred to back on Page 3. So light blue is our seismic again covers most of the Gulf of Mexico. Dark Blue is our acreage I mentioned earlier. It’s one of the biggest acreage positions in the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nAnd then those light blue dots is our facilities that we control and operate. And if you look at the gold-colored boxes, these are the leases that we picked up in the lease sale. Notice how they’re peppered around those facilities by owning and controlling and operating these facilities. It focuses our team and where we can develop inventory around these facilities. And what you notice is we think we’ve added 12 to 15 potential locations just in this last lease sale, growing our overall location count for the company. Let’s go to Page 10 and talk about the drilling program for the year and how things are going. I mentioned there is a Lime Rock at the beginning of the presentation. If you read the earnings release, you might have seen our reference to the Lobster Waterflood project that was successful in the first quarter and we expect to see that rate start to hit us in the third quarter and throughout 2024 and 2025.\\n\\nWe had a stimulation campaign weighted in the first quarter, then we’ll take a break and have another project in the third quarter. The Claiborne sidetrack, which is non-op was successful. We’ll see that rate increase in the second quarter and really get full rate in the third quarter. And then we start our drilling campaign with the Katmai project. I’m going to talk about that. And then the Daenerys project, which is a high-impact sub-salt well. But ultimately we’re going to try to get into this year, it could work into next year as well. And then again, we have the Sunspear completion, which is important. So we can see that production from that discovery of last year be available to us in the first half of next year. As I mentioned on Page 11, we give you a little update on Venice and Lime Rock, and you can see it here.\\n\\nAgain, the Ram Powell facility is a facility that we bought in 2018. We own 100% of that facility, and it’s an important host facility, not only for our drilling campaign, but it can be a host facility for third-party discoveries that might need to utilize the asset. But what Lime Rock and Venice has always showed is really good execution on our strategy. These are locations that we’ve identified after we bought the asset. You can see the impact on the right side of the page, and then you can see that we brought those wells online and they’re relatively flat still, as we think about this 90 days later. Let’s go to Page 12 and talk about the Greater Katmai area. I think it’s important to note that this is a discovery, a sub-salt discovery, at 27,000 feet below the surface.\\n\\nThe initial reservoir pressures were over 20,000 pounds. It’s a big geological complex that we’re still learning about today. It could have as many resources as 180 million to 200 million barrels. And although it’s a fairly recent discovery, it’s already produced 17 million barrels. And it’s doing so at a facility constraint of 27,000 to 28,000 barrels equivalent a day, that you can see on the right side of the chart. Now, you’ll notice in the first quarter we had some planned downtime, and although that’s frustrating, it’s an important planned downtime because it lets us work on the facility. It also lets us collect critical information on the pressures that we see downhole. And that’s causing us to have more confidence in how we think this field will get developed.\\n\\nLet’s continue the conversation around Katmai and talk about the Katmai West number two well, and why we think it’s so important. And there’s a lot going on in the slide, but it helps understand how we think about better defining and expanding the resource when you have a deepwater discovery like Katmai. So if you go on the graphic on the left, what we’re showing you visually is where the Katmai West number one well was drilled geologically in the structure. And then on the right, we’re trying to help you understand how that better defines lowest known oil, which defines our proved reserves. And so you have a 400-foot pay column that helps to find proved reserves and then to better expand what the resource could be, you have to have a combination of good production data, good pressure data, and then ultimately another geological test.\\n\\nThat next geological test is Katmai West number two well. We’re going to extend the geological column and with that information and the pressure of data and the production data, we’re going to have a better understanding on whether the potential of 100 million barrels is available to us. We think this is a very important well, it’s a great use of capital allocation. And to talk more about capital allocation outside our drilling program, I’m going to hand it over to Sergio.\\n\\nSergio Maiworm: Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. As Tim mentioned earlier in the call, we have increased our debt reduction target from $400 million to $550 million by the end of the year. Also a couple of months ago in our last earnings call, we guided the market to expect a leverage target at the end of the year of one times or below, and we’re actually able to achieve one times at the end of the first quarter. So we’re way ahead on our target there, and I expect that number to continue to go down as we make additional debt reductions throughout the year. At the closing of the QuarterNorth transaction, our debt stood at $1.8 billion. And that was a combination of $550 million on our RBL and $1.25 billion in bonds.\\n\\nIn the first quarter, a combination of cash flow generated by the business and its sale of TLCS allowed us to pay $225 million to achieve a debt balance at the end of the first quarter of $1.575 billion. We expect to continue to pay down debt throughout the year, and at year-end we expect the revolver to be fully paid down. So another $325 million of debt reduction this year as expected. On Page 15, I wanted to highlight three metrics that shows how compelling of a value opportunity Talos is to investors. First, we have one of the highest oil contents or highest oil exposures in the entirety of the E&P sector in the United States. And as a continuation of that, we also have one of the top margins in the business, and that allows us to generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow that we don’t believe is being recognized in our market cap now, which shows itself having one of the highest free cash flow yields in the entirety of the E&P space.\\n\\nThis includes every single E&P company above $1 billion of market cap, excluding the Majors. So this includes all of the very large E&P companies as well. And Talos is consistently a top decile performer on all of these metrics. On Page 16, I want to talk about our priorities for maximizing free cash flow and how we’re going to utilize our free cash flow. First and foremost, we’re laser-focused on delivering and executing our business plan that is the main focus for 2024. And as Tim mentioned, the QuarterNorth integration is well underway and going very well. We believe the QuarterNorth acquisition adds a significant amount of scale to the business, as well as high-margin oil-weighted production for our portfolio, which combined with our industry-leading netback margins that we talked about earlier and our streamlined capital program for 2024, puts us in a great path to deliver on that — on the business plan this year.\\n\\nRegarding our full-year guidance, we’re reiterating our operational and financial guidance and we continue to expect an average production for the year between 89,000 barrels and 95,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that is about 71% oil and about 80% liquids. As I mentioned previously, this includes a little less than 10 months of contribution from the QuarterNorth assets, as well as expected downtime estimates for the HP-1 drydock and Katmai facilities work, among others, and unplanned downtime for weather-related events and potential downstream events from us as well. In the second quarter production, we expect 93,000 to 96,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and about 70% oil. And that includes the expected planned downtime for the HP-1, which as we said earlier is roughly 5,000 barrels to 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.\\n\\nWe also remain steadfast in our debt reduction goals, as we mentioned earlier, and we have increased that goal from $400 million to $550 million. In our capital investments for 2024, we have a mixed of development and exploration and we believe that is the right mix to create the most value for shareholders in the long run. Lastly, M&A continues to be a pillar of our strategy and we continue to actively seek further accretive M&A opportunities to accelerate our growth trajectory, deliver on our strategy, and create further value for shareholders. And now I’d like to turn the call back to Tim to wrap up with our key takeaways for the quarter.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Thanks, Sergio. So, let’s move to Page 17, which I think is a great wrap-up slide. We think we’re one of the most important counterparties in the Gulf of Mexico and Sergio mentioned how we’re thinking about M&A and certainly an important part of our strategy. But really, as I think about us as a counterparty that includes business development activities such as the JV we announced in the fourth quarter with Repsol, the other JV we announced with BP and Chevron on prospect swaps. We have partnerships with critical private companies in the Gulf of Mexico. It’s important that we take on this leadership position for a strategy that’s focused on offshore infrastructure. We’ve got a high-quality and stable asset base. When we have these deepwater discoveries and they come online and we bring on those new wells, it helps us better manage our base decline, which is around 20%.\\n\\nWhen these assets are flowing at full rate, they’re flowing at over 105,000 barrels equivalent a day. We modeled through the downtime, but the capacity of these assets are great. We think — as Sergio talked about just in the last couple of slides, we think we have one of the highest EBITDA margins in the E&P space based on our oil exposure. And we think it’s underappreciated the to deliver free cash flow yield that we’re generating right now. We’re committed to low leverage and we’ve accelerated our debt reduction program. And we anticipate getting as high as $550 million. And that’s important because it’s fully based of the RBL, which gives us flexibility for the future. We believe in the growth potential that we have. And we talked about in this presentation, the good work we did in the last lease sale, the drilling JVs we have actively ongoing, and the drilling program we have ongoing.\\n\\nSo a lot of catalysts in the system that we’re very proud of. And we’re doing all this while we continue to be committed to safety and sustainability. You know, we’ve been putting at out our ESG reports as one of the leaders in the Gulf of Mexico on how we think about sustainability. We’ll continue to do that, even though we don’t own TLCS. We’re committed to the idea of the ecosystem that we’re involved in and we’re proud of our efforts today. With that, I’ll hand it over for questions.\\n\\nSee also Insiders are Buying These 10 Undervalued Bank Stocks and 10 Future Dividend Kings in the Next 5 Years or Less.\\n\\nQ&A Session\\n\\nFollow Talos Energy Inc.

Please go ahead.\\n\\nTim Rezvan: Good morning, folks, and thank you for taking my question.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Hi, Tim. Good morning.\\n\\nTim Rezvan: I want to start on — I want to start on Sergio’s comments for Jan to prepare a script about actively seeking further M&A opportunities. Obviously, the integration has gone pretty well here. So I was curious, Tim, can you kind of give updated thoughts on what you’re seeing in the M&A landscape both kind of within the Gulf and outside it? As you think about it, oil is run here, but there’s a lot of backwardation on the strip. So just curious, kind of what you’re seeing out there?\\n\\nTim Duncan: I think it’s maybe a little slower than where we were a year ago. We knew in the Gulf of Mexico particularly, there was a couple of key privates, and ultimately that was EnVen and QuarterNorth that we were focused on. And we knew they could bolster the business, and so we’re proud of how we executed those. There is not those obvious candidates today. And so I think our focus has been really execution, which we’re proud of the first quarter. We’re excited about the rest of the year. There is some tactical small things that we’re thinking about when we think about our infrastructure and how to do things that are accretive to what we currently own tactically in the Gulf. And certainly, there might be some activity outside the Gulf.\\n\\nBut I would tell you that’s a slower churn, and it’s not where our focus is today. And so probably a little slower on that front than maybe in the last couple of years, where we knew kind of what was coming. There is a little less knowing of what is coming, and that’s fine. We’ve got a team that’s focused on it. But I think it’s more tactical, it’s more business execution if I’m thinking about the near term.\\n\\nTim Rezvan: Okay. Okay. I appreciate that. And then as my follow-up, you partially answered my question in your prepared comments, saying that your goal is to have the credit facility paid off by the end of the year. So I’ll follow up with something I asked last quarter. When you see leverage potentially getting below $1 billion or excuse me net debt below $1 billion, how do you think about maybe repurchases kind of re-entering the equation or kind of what are the Board’s thoughts? I know you don’t want to put the cart in front of the horse, but you have line of sight on these leverage reduction targets. How are you thinking about using incremental free cash flow after that? Thanks.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Yes. Look, it’s a good question. I can tell you the Board’s thoughts and our thoughts today are just get that RBL paid off, just because I think it provides maximum liquidity and flexibility. Look, we still have a $50 million authorization on stock repurchases, and we could think about that. But I do think we’re hyper-focused on getting through the year and make sure that revolver is paid off. You can build up a little cash kind of for some of these tactical ideas we have, and I wouldn’t hold back. Right now, it’s harder to restart your own operated capital program, but we do see a lot of opportunities out there as people are thinking about high grading, their exploration in their drilling joint ventures, and their drilling inventory.\\n\\nAnd I don’t think we would lose sight of if an opportunity came our way and we had cash available to invest in a new opportunity, we would think about that. So I think we’re going to have multiple Board meetings throughout the course of the year. We’re going to think about where are we on the schedule. How do we think about some of those capital return policies against the opportunity set? And really, what’s the best decision that creates long-term value? And sometimes, if you have $25 million to deploy on a stock purchase versus an opportunity that comes your way, that can generate a 30%, 40%, 50% rate of return, you’ve got to think about each of those opportunities individually. So the near-term focus again getting the RBL paid off, I think everything can be on the table once we accomplish that goal.\\n\\nTim Rezvan: Okay. Thank you.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Benchmark. Please go ahead.\\n\\nSubash Chandra: Yes. Hi, Tim, could you kind of talk to the production trajectory from now to year-end? And I think in your March presentation, you sort of had a slide talking about 105 to 110. You referenced 105, I think, in your comments, but 105 to 110 sort of being, it was a proforma. But is that the baseline that we return to and if you can kind of talk through that and what we should be expecting, say, as an exit rate for the year?\\n\\nTim Duncan: Yes. Thanks, Subash. Yes. You know, look, I think it’s an important slide because what we’re trying to talk about there is kind of unencumbered production. So when everything is running right, how do you start the concept around where you get to ultimately where we landed on guidance? And so even when I talked about, I think, in the last call the first month, the assets together even before we close, averaging 106, and before drydock averaging 105, there’s a little downtime in there. There’s always some downtime in the system as we’re doing rotating equipment, doing some kind of other construction projects around these assets. From there, then you’re trying to plan out when this downtime can occur. What’s in your control?\\n\\nWhat’s out of your control? Obviously, for example, HP-1, the timing of when that vessel gets to drydock is not within our control, when we’re waiting on something like thrusters that they have to replace. So we had some downtime. As soon as we own the assets in QuarterNorth around Katmai, we knew that downtime was important to help us set up what we’re excited about in drilling that well. Now we’re in the second quarter, we’re going to have downtime in HP-1, some third-party downtime downstream of our Pompano facility. And these aren’t small downtimes, you’ve got a facility like the HP-1, where net to us were close to 9,000 barrels equivalent a day, or the Pompano facility where it’s over 10,000 barrels equivalent a day. So they’re chunky downtimes.\\n\\nBut that’s why we wanted to kind of walk through that in that deck that’s on the site as we laid out our guidance. So everything’s on track. I think even the QuarterNorth assets for the quarter have been averaging well over 30,000 barrels equivalent a day, which we talked about when we bought the assets. So again, the assets are performing very well. This is really around the cadence of that downtime. Some of that in your control, some of that could slip. We will try to make sure we guide that every quarter. But if we’re not changing anything relative to the annual guidance, you can expect that to kind of tick up as we go throughout the year. Again, some of that’s weather-dependent as well. So, look, I think if that ticks up, you can expect operating costs as a unit of production to go down.\\n\\nAnd so I think, you know, we’re really happy with the first quarter, we had beats in production and EBITDA and CapEx and free cash flow. You expect that we would expect that to continue as we go throughout the year.\\n\\nSubash Chandra: Okay. Got it. So it looks like, is it fair to say the downtime is mostly or maybe entirely legacy assets and that we should be thinking…\\n\\nTim Duncan: Yes. Well, look, Katmai was the big piece of the downtime in the first quarter, you know, and I think I showed that on the graph, and look we couldn’t be more excited about that asset. And honestly, there was some repairs and maintenance that we did during that downtime, which is actually a third-party pipeline downtime. We actually did a couple of things that actually raised production 1,000 barrels a day on that facility as a result of doing some repairs during that downtime. So, you know, this downtime is for the benefit of these assets. Let’s be clear about that. Now, in the second quarter, yes, that’s going to be more a Talos legacy. As we go into the third quarter, it could be a mix of both assets. So, you know, it’s not, I don’t want to say we’re pinning it on either of these asset sets because it’s just part of the aggregate pro forma business.\\n\\nI think what we’re trying to do is be more transparent to you guys and more transparent to the market on how we think about production in offshore assets relative to onshore assets, and how you should try to think about modeling downtime and modeling weather, starting with a clean run rate. And I think that was the purpose of the slide we had in the last deck, and we’ll continue to have that slide in our future decks.\\n\\nSubash Chandra: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Tim.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Leo Mariani from ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\\n\\nLeo Mariani: Hi. Wanted to talk a little bit more about Katmai. Number two, how do you kind of think about the potential risk associated with that? Well, you guys basically certainly expect it to be incremental to production. Is it maybe just a matter of how much production and reserves it’s going to potentially add? Maybe just can you give us a little more color on that?\\n\\nTim Duncan: Well, look, when you’ve got what I call operational risk, and then you’ve got broadly what’s happening from the subsurface perspective, Leo. Operationally, the one thing that we tried to harp on here, without getting too nerdy about it, is we’ve got these bottom-hole pressure gauges right there at the perforations. And so we know exactly what’s happening when we flow a well, we know how that well is declining. And when we shut in a well, we know how that pressure is building up. That helps us with the planning of a well. We kind of know exactly what we’re entering into. And then we’ve got better seismic data. We’re going through a lot of reprocessing that, you know, Leo, we do all the time. So we think we’ve got a good picture of the structure geologically.\\n\\nYou’ve got a good handle on what’s happening from a pressure environment. The team can design the well. The purpose of the well though is just to try to go see what this feature looks like as we get further away from the current well. And certainly, nothing is guaranteed. I mean, you could go down there and learn something different than what you anticipate. But what we hope is that we’re going to expand the geological column and we’re going to open up that geological structure. And by doing so, we have a chance to add significant amount of reserves. And that’s where you get into the full upside picture. So if you can imagine, you know, as we work with an auditor like Netherland and Sewell, we’re working with them to try to say, hey, look, how do we think about proved, which is just the column that you found in the first well, how do we think about probables and possibles?\\n\\nAll of that gets into that broader resource. And just based on the data we have so far, there could be a meaningful resource there. You can wait and produce it and it’s going to take you a while to convince everybody that, that resource has that full potential or you can do a combination of producing, analyzing, and drilling for it. And I think it makes sense for us to drill for it. So we look, we think that this kind of fits in that combination of probable and possible categories and so kind of in that more than 50% more likely than not. But you know, we are at 27,000 feet and so you know, I think we’re going to have to go find out, but I think we’re very optimistic about what we’re doing this year on Katmai.\\n\\nLeo Mariani: Okay, now that was great, very thorough there. And I just wanted to follow up on QuarterNorth in the synergies. I think you mentioned that you thought you’d get to kind of $30 million kind of run rate by the end of the year, kind of at $20 million now and you get the full $55 million next year. Is the $30 million this year primarily just the kind of the G&A savings and maybe some of the interest that you might have got and is the ops stuff kind of the extra $25 million next year? I know you’re talking about potentially being able to lower some of the OP costs as the year goes on. Just want to get a little bit more color around the numbers here.\\n\\nSergio Maiworm: Hi, Leo, this is Sergio. I’m happy to answer that. Yes, I would say, in 2024, the majority of those synergies are going to come through G&A savings. We do expect some of that to be from insurance cost reduction as well, as we put the two portfolios together, we have meaningful savings there. And as the year progresses, we do expect to start realizing some of those operational synergies. But most of those operational synergies should materialize in 2025, but we should start seeing some of that as the year progresses as well.\\n\\nLeo Mariani: Okay. And I guess, just on the OP synergies, is that largely going to show through in LOE and maybe some in CapEx as well? Just trying to make sure I understand how that hits the financials.\\n\\nSergio Maiworm: Yes, you’re going to see it in both. I think we can optimize some of the logistics with helicopters and vessels, some of the supply chain, there is some yards, and how we manage spare parts and things of that nature. That is going to be the majority of those savings on the LOE side of things. And on the capital side, obviously, we can optimize rig lines. We can better manage how we drill wells and how the sequence of those wells, et cetera. So most of the operational synergies that I talked about just a minute ago, I was referring more to LOE. I think as we plan for 2025 and beyond, you should start seeing more and more of that in capital as well.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Yes, I would say, Leo, a little different than onshore, where we might have somebody has assets in Eagle Ford with multiple rig lines, multiple frac lines, and then they just figure out how to bring those together. You see a little less of that offshore because how we pull these rigs in can be unique to any one budget year. So, as Sergio said, a little more on LOE, but ultimately it hits both sides.\\n\\nLeo Mariani: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.\\n\\nSergio Maiworm: All right. Thanks, Leo.\\n\\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Robertson from Water Tower Research. Please go ahead.\\n\\nJeff Robertson: Thank you. Good morning. Tim, to follow up on your comments around, Katmai West. Am I right in thinking that the combination of the pressure data and the minimal drawdown that you’ve seen over eight months of production, plus reprocessed seismic? Makes you think that the container is bigger, which justifies drilling the number two well to try to test that theory and maybe add reserves and accelerate production.\\n\\nTim Duncan: Yes. Look, I don’t know if it’s — the answer to that is yes, Jeff. But I would say, we’ve always been optimistic about this asset. It’s one of the reasons we went and bought — executed on the transaction in the first place. I mean, when we — we’ve been — we’ve had our eye on this asset since it was discovered. You know, we had a chance to potentially buy a working interest in it in a transaction in ’19, and we waited and got better data and feel good about adding it to the portfolio when we did the transaction in 2023. So we’ve been bullish about the area. But when you get down to the very details of what you’re allowed to book, improved reserves, you and the auditor you’re working with need to see something more than just your intuition, right?\\n\\nAnd so at some point, you’ve got to expand, physically expand that geological column into reasonable certainty, either through that information or ultimately getting physical data, like drilling a well and getting the data yourself. And so, for us to accelerate that value in the proved, it’s going to require a well. And so then you have to decide, where are you. You know, how do you feel about the risk of drilling that well? Which is a question I think Leo asks, and we feel good about it. So we’ve always been bullish in the area. It’s time to go put some capital to it so we can go back to the auditors and show why we think this feature is as big as we hope it is. And you’re right, look, there is going to be some pressure declines. You want that.\\n\\nIt’s the pace of those declines relative to the volume it might be seeing that gives you the confidence as you go design a well.\\n\\nJeff Robertson: Tim, do you think it has the potential to add value that might not have been fully quantified when you purchased QuarterNorth?\\n\\nTim Duncan: It certainly wasn’t into underwritten purchase price. I mean, look, we were buying this asset, it almost proved developed. And so I can tell you right now that just the minimum volumes coming through the current production is what we’re able to get into approved, it is still a young discovery in that regard. So there is no doubt that what we’re trying to go execute here is outside the underwritten economics, is tarnished, or not reflected in the stock price. As Sergio talked about, we obviously, we think we have a totally underappreciated valuation on the stock price. So all of this is upside to either how we financed and fundamentally put together the transaction, and certainly all of this is a catalyst for the stock.\\n\\nJeff Robertson: And then just to follow, you talked about infrastructure and the importance of owning infrastructure, and you’ve seen that at ramp out. So with Tarantula, I think you all own or Talos owns a 50% interest in it and hasn’t override. Can you talk about the margin impact of adding barrels through owned facilities and the kind of fees you collect and how that enhances Talos’ owned margins?'"

West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark price, is up more than 10% to nearly $80 a barrel. Higher crude prices are driving up most energy stocks.\\n\\nOne of the easiest ways to cash in on the oil-fueled rally in energy stocks is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the sector. They provide relatively broad exposure to the sector, enabling investors to enjoy some oil-fueled gains.\\n\\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE), and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP) stand out to some Fool.com contributors as the top energy ETFs to buy this month for those seeking to cash in on higher crude oil prices this year. Here's why they like them.\\n\\nThis energy fund has you well-covered\\n\\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Energy Select Sector SPDR): There's one thing you can count on when it comes to oil prices, and that's volatility. Right now oil prices are generally rising, but soon enough the prices could be heading lower again. In other words, if you're trying to cash in on higher oil prices you should, at the same time, think about hedging your bet against the risk of falling prices. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is as close as you can get to doing both of those things at the same time.\\n\\nEnergy Select SPDR ETF basically owns the energy stocks in the S&P 500 index. For starters, that means the energy stocks in the ETF have been vetted to ensure that they're large and economically important entities. That removes more risky investments from the mix. And Energy Select SPDR ETF is, like the S&P 500, market-cap weighted. So the largest energy companies make up the largest share of the ETF. In this instance, that means ExxonMobil and Chevron account for around 40% of the ETF's assets.\\n\\nExxon and Chevron are globally diversified, integrated energy giants. They're among the safest energy stocks you can own. Normally, I prefer ETFs with more diversified portfolios, but in the case of energy, being overweight in these two industry giants is a huge benefit.\\n\\nThe other 60% of the portfolio provides exposure to energy stocks that are likely to be more volatile, allowing you to see higher stock gains when oil prices are moving upward. If that doesn't pan out, however, the ETF still has the foundational investment in Exxon and Chevron to fall back on it.\\n\\nA solid fund to navigate the energy sector\\n\\nNeha Chamaria (Vanguard Energy ETF): If you're seeking exposure to oil and gas stocks amid higher oil prices, the Vanguard Energy ETF is one of your best bets. It's a low-cost fund, and its top holdings include some of the largest oil and gas stocks in the U.S. In fact, nearly 87% of the fund's assets are in large-cap stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nExxonMobil and Chevron are the fund's two biggest holdings, respectively accounting for about 22% and 13.5% of its assets as of May 1. ConocoPhillips comes third, making up just over 7% of the fund's assets. Other notable top holdings include Schlumberger, Marathon Petroleum, and EOG Resources. The Vanguard Energy ETF is heavily focused on oil and gas producers, making it a no-brainer bet in a high oil-price environment.\\n\\nWith 116 stocks in its portfolio, the Vanguard Energy ETF is also one of the most diversified energy ETFs. By comparison, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, has only 25 stocks in its portfolio. The greater diversification can help investors in the fund mitigate risks.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the Vanguard Energy ETF gives you exposure to such a diversified group of top energy stocks for a low cost -- it has an expense ratio of only 0.10%. Also, since most of the top stocks in the fund's portfolio pay a dividend, the ETF currently yields 2.9%.\\n\\nWith the Vanguard Energy ETF, you get exposure to a basket of top oil and gas stocks and broad diversification -- all at a low cost and with a dividend, too. This makes it an ideal pick to ride an oil boom.\\n\\nA less concentrated approach\\n\\nMatt DiLallo (SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF): The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Energy ETF are great ways to gain exposure to the energy sector. However, they have one drawback. They're a bit top-heavy.\\n\\nAs my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out above, Exxon and Chevron comprise about 40% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. Likewise, as Neha Chamaria notes, those two energy giants make up over 35% of the Vanguard Energy ETF. While outsized exposure to those big oil giants helps mute some risks, it adds others, including the fact that underperformance by one of the leaders could cause a lag in overall performance of the fund.\\n\\nThe SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF takes a different approach. Whereas those ETFs weigh their holdings by market cap, this oil stock ETF tracks a modified equal-weighed index of oil and gas companies. It provides unconcentrated exposure to oil and gas producers, currently holding 52 energy stocks with relatively equal weightings.\\n\\nIts largest holding was natural gas producer Antero Resources, with a 3.1% weighting. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil was its 10th largest holding at 2.7%. Overall, its top 10 holdings comprised only about 27% of the fund's value. This broader diversification enables smaller, faster-growing energy companies to have a greater impact on its value. In turn, that has helped fuel stronger performance by this fund over the past year:\\n\\nXOP Chart\\n\\nXOP data by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats. The ETF charges a higher expense ratio than those rival funds, at 0.35% vs. 0.09% for the Energy Select Sector fund and 0.1% for Vanguard Energy. That higher expense ratio will eat into the fund's returns over the long term.\\n\\nOn top of that, it's important to note that this fund's price will likely be more volatile than those other ETFs, given its broader exposure to smaller energy companies. Of course, this volatility can also work in your favor during periods of rising oil prices.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\\u2019t one of them.

West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark price, is up more than 10% to nearly $80 a barrel. Higher crude prices are driving up most energy stocks.\\n\\nOne of the easiest ways to cash in on the oil-fueled rally in energy stocks is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the sector. They provide relatively broad exposure to the sector, enabling investors to enjoy some oil-fueled gains.\\n\\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE), and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP) stand out to some Fool.com contributors as the top energy ETFs to buy this month for those seeking to cash in on higher crude oil prices this year. Here's why they like them.\\n\\nThis energy fund has you well-covered\\n\\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Energy Select Sector SPDR): There's one thing you can count on when it comes to oil prices, and that's volatility. Right now oil prices are generally rising, but soon enough the prices could be heading lower again. In other words, if you're trying to cash in on higher oil prices you should, at the same time, think about hedging your bet against the risk of falling prices. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is as close as you can get to doing both of those things at the same time.\\n\\nEnergy Select SPDR ETF basically owns the energy stocks in the S&P 500 index. For starters, that means the energy stocks in the ETF have been vetted to ensure that they're large and economically important entities. That removes more risky investments from the mix. And Energy Select SPDR ETF is, like the S&P 500, market-cap weighted. So the largest energy companies make up the largest share of the ETF. In this instance, that means ExxonMobil and Chevron account for around 40% of the ETF's assets.\\n\\nExxon and Chevron are globally diversified, integrated energy giants. They're among the safest energy stocks you can own. Normally, I prefer ETFs with more diversified portfolios, but in the case of energy, being overweight in these two industry giants is a huge benefit.\\n\\nThe other 60% of the portfolio provides exposure to energy stocks that are likely to be more volatile, allowing you to see higher stock gains when oil prices are moving upward. If that doesn't pan out, however, the ETF still has the foundational investment in Exxon and Chevron to fall back on it.\\n\\nA solid fund to navigate the energy sector\\n\\nNeha Chamaria (Vanguard Energy ETF): If you're seeking exposure to oil and gas stocks amid higher oil prices, the Vanguard Energy ETF is one of your best bets. It's a low-cost fund, and its top holdings include some of the largest oil and gas stocks in the U.S. In fact, nearly 87% of the fund's assets are in large-cap stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nExxonMobil and Chevron are the fund's two biggest holdings, respectively accounting for about 22% and 13.5% of its assets as of May 1. ConocoPhillips comes third, making up just over 7% of the fund's assets. Other notable top holdings include Schlumberger, Marathon Petroleum, and EOG Resources. The Vanguard Energy ETF is heavily focused on oil and gas producers, making it a no-brainer bet in a high oil-price environment.\\n\\nWith 116 stocks in its portfolio, the Vanguard Energy ETF is also one of the most diversified energy ETFs. By comparison, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, has only 25 stocks in its portfolio. The greater diversification can help investors in the fund mitigate risks.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the Vanguard Energy ETF gives you exposure to such a diversified group of top energy stocks for a low cost -- it has an expense ratio of only 0.10%. Also, since most of the top stocks in the fund's portfolio pay a dividend, the ETF currently yields 2.9%.\\n\\nWith the Vanguard Energy ETF, you get exposure to a basket of top oil and gas stocks and broad diversification -- all at a low cost and with a dividend, too. This makes it an ideal pick to ride an oil boom.\\n\\nA less concentrated approach\\n\\nMatt DiLallo (SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF): The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Energy ETF are great ways to gain exposure to the energy sector. However, they have one drawback. They're a bit top-heavy.\\n\\nAs my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out above, Exxon and Chevron comprise about 40% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. Likewise, as Neha Chamaria notes, those two energy giants make up over 35% of the Vanguard Energy ETF. While outsized exposure to those big oil giants helps mute some risks, it adds others, including the fact that underperformance by one of the leaders could cause a lag in overall performance of the fund.\\n\\nThe SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF takes a different approach. Whereas those ETFs weigh their holdings by market cap, this oil stock ETF tracks a modified equal-weighed index of oil and gas companies. It provides unconcentrated exposure to oil and gas producers, currently holding 52 energy stocks with relatively equal weightings.\\n\\nIts largest holding was natural gas producer Antero Resources, with a 3.1% weighting. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil was its 10th largest holding at 2.7%. Overall, its top 10 holdings comprised only about 27% of the fund's value. This broader diversification enables smaller, faster-growing energy companies to have a greater impact on its value. In turn, that has helped fuel stronger performance by this fund over the past year:\\n\\nXOP Chart\\n\\nXOP data by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats. The ETF charges a higher expense ratio than those rival funds, at 0.35% vs. 0.09% for the Energy Select Sector fund and 0.1% for Vanguard Energy. That higher expense ratio will eat into the fund's returns over the long term.\\n\\nOn top of that, it's important to note that this fund's price will likely be more volatile than those other ETFs, given its broader exposure to smaller energy companies. Of course, this volatility can also work in your favor during periods of rising oil prices.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\\u2019t one of them.

West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark price, is up more than 10% to nearly $80 a barrel. Higher crude prices are driving up most energy stocks.\\n\\nOne of the easiest ways to cash in on the oil-fueled rally in energy stocks is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the sector. They provide relatively broad exposure to the sector, enabling investors to enjoy some oil-fueled gains.\\n\\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE), and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP) stand out to some Fool.com contributors as the top energy ETFs to buy this month for those seeking to cash in on higher crude oil prices this year. Here's why they like them.\\n\\nThis energy fund has you well-covered\\n\\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Energy Select Sector SPDR): There's one thing you can count on when it comes to oil prices, and that's volatility. Right now oil prices are generally rising, but soon enough the prices could be heading lower again. In other words, if you're trying to cash in on higher oil prices you should, at the same time, think about hedging your bet against the risk of falling prices. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is as close as you can get to doing both of those things at the same time.\\n\\nEnergy Select SPDR ETF basically owns the energy stocks in the S&P 500 index. For starters, that means the energy stocks in the ETF have been vetted to ensure that they're large and economically important entities. That removes more risky investments from the mix. And Energy Select SPDR ETF is, like the S&P 500, market-cap weighted. So the largest energy companies make up the largest share of the ETF. In this instance, that means ExxonMobil and Chevron account for around 40% of the ETF's assets.\\n\\nExxon and Chevron are globally diversified, integrated energy giants. They're among the safest energy stocks you can own. Normally, I prefer ETFs with more diversified portfolios, but in the case of energy, being overweight in these two industry giants is a huge benefit.\\n\\nThe other 60% of the portfolio provides exposure to energy stocks that are likely to be more volatile, allowing you to see higher stock gains when oil prices are moving upward. If that doesn't pan out, however, the ETF still has the foundational investment in Exxon and Chevron to fall back on it.\\n\\nA solid fund to navigate the energy sector\\n\\nNeha Chamaria (Vanguard Energy ETF): If you're seeking exposure to oil and gas stocks amid higher oil prices, the Vanguard Energy ETF is one of your best bets. It's a low-cost fund, and its top holdings include some of the largest oil and gas stocks in the U.S. In fact, nearly 87% of the fund's assets are in large-cap stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nExxonMobil and Chevron are the fund's two biggest holdings, respectively accounting for about 22% and 13.5% of its assets as of May 1. ConocoPhillips comes third, making up just over 7% of the fund's assets. Other notable top holdings include Schlumberger, Marathon Petroleum, and EOG Resources. The Vanguard Energy ETF is heavily focused on oil and gas producers, making it a no-brainer bet in a high oil-price environment.\\n\\nWith 116 stocks in its portfolio, the Vanguard Energy ETF is also one of the most diversified energy ETFs. By comparison, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, has only 25 stocks in its portfolio. The greater diversification can help investors in the fund mitigate risks.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the Vanguard Energy ETF gives you exposure to such a diversified group of top energy stocks for a low cost -- it has an expense ratio of only 0.10%. Also, since most of the top stocks in the fund's portfolio pay a dividend, the ETF currently yields 2.9%.\\n\\nWith the Vanguard Energy ETF, you get exposure to a basket of top oil and gas stocks and broad diversification -- all at a low cost and with a dividend, too. This makes it an ideal pick to ride an oil boom.\\n\\nA less concentrated approach\\n\\nMatt DiLallo (SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF): The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Energy ETF are great ways to gain exposure to the energy sector. However, they have one drawback. They're a bit top-heavy.\\n\\nAs my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out above, Exxon and Chevron comprise about 40% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. Likewise, as Neha Chamaria notes, those two energy giants make up over 35% of the Vanguard Energy ETF. While outsized exposure to those big oil giants helps mute some risks, it adds others, including the fact that underperformance by one of the leaders could cause a lag in overall performance of the fund.\\n\\nThe SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF takes a different approach. Whereas those ETFs weigh their holdings by market cap, this oil stock ETF tracks a modified equal-weighed index of oil and gas companies. It provides unconcentrated exposure to oil and gas producers, currently holding 52 energy stocks with relatively equal weightings.\\n\\nIts largest holding was natural gas producer Antero Resources, with a 3.1% weighting. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil was its 10th largest holding at 2.7%. Overall, its top 10 holdings comprised only about 27% of the fund's value. This broader diversification enables smaller, faster-growing energy companies to have a greater impact on its value. In turn, that has helped fuel stronger performance by this fund over the past year:\\n\\nXOP Chart\\n\\nXOP data by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats. The ETF charges a higher expense ratio than those rival funds, at 0.35% vs. 0.09% for the Energy Select Sector fund and 0.1% for Vanguard Energy. That higher expense ratio will eat into the fund's returns over the long term.\\n\\nOn top of that, it's important to note that this fund's price will likely be more volatile than those other ETFs, given its broader exposure to smaller energy companies. Of course, this volatility can also work in your favor during periods of rising oil prices.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\\u2019t one of them.

[ operator instructions ] this call is being recorded on tuesday, may 7, 2024. and i would now like to turn the conference over to clay jeansonne. thank you. please go ahead. clay jeansonne : thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. joining me today to discuss our results are tim duncan, president and chief executive officer ; sergio maiworm, executive vice president and chief financial officer. for our prepared remarks, we will refer to our first quarter 2024 earnings slide presentation, which is available for viewing and downloading on talos \\u2019 website. starting on slide 2. cautionary statements, i \\u2019 d like to remind you that our remarks will include forward - looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward - looking statements. factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in yesterday \\u2019 s press release and our form 10 - q for the period ending march 31, 2024, filed yesterday with the sec. forward - looking statements are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. during this call, we may present gaap and non - gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of gaap to non - gaap measures is included in yesterday \\u2019 s press release, which was filed with the sec and is available on our website. and now i \\u2019 d like to turn the call over to tim. tim duncan : thank you, clay, and welcome aboard. we \\u2019 re going to start this presentation on slide 3. we \\u2019 re going to discuss how we \\u2019 ve repositioned ourselves over the last year with the last two m & a deals. we \\u2019 re the fourth largest acreage holder in the gulf of mexico, and we \\u2019 re the fifth largest operator in the gulf of mexico. and we have two tenets to our strategy that we think are important. one,\",\n          \"we focus on oil - weighted assets, and two, we think it \\u2019 s critically important that we operate our deepwater infrastructure, and it allows us to focus our prospect inventory around this infrastructure and allows us to shorten our cycle times when we think about drilling these wells and getting them in first oil. let \\u2019 s go to slide 4, and talk about what might have been one of our busiest quarters in the company \\u2019 s history. we ended the year by bringing on venice and lime rock ahead of schedule and with sustained rates at over 18, 000 barrels equivalent a day. and in january we announced the quarternorth transaction, our second transaction of over $ 1 billion in the last year, adding important scale to our business. immediately after that transaction, we announced a couple of capital markets transactions, including lowering the cost capital of our debt by refinancing our high - yield notes. we were able to close the quarternorth transaction within 45 days, which helps us accelerate our synergies. we were also able to update our financial guidance, increasing our production guidance. and then later we also updated our debt guidance from $ 400 million to $ 550 million of debt repayments for the year. also within the quarter, we announced the divestiture of our ccs business to totalenergies. i \\u2019 ll speak more about the importance of that transaction on the next slide. so on page 5, we went through a lot of these highlights on page 4. let me focus on a couple of bullets on each side of this page. so first on the left side of the page, we had record production in the first quarter at the high end of our guidance, and you \\u2019 re going to see this go up tremendously in the second quarter. and sergio will talk about that later in the presentation. some of these other bullets i just discussed, but let me focus a little bit on the sale of tlcs business. we \\u2019 re bullish about what ccs can be long - term, but we did notice that emissions reductions were slowing down within these facilities and that capital requirements were going up. so we thought the right move for us was to transact on this business. we got a solid return over two times our money and immediately take those proceeds and accelerate our debt repayment. as we get to the right side of the page and focus on what we \\u2019 re trying to do from here, we think it \\u2019 s important to continue to remind the market that even though we \\u2019 re projecting 35 % to\",\n          \"although that \\u2019 s frustrating, it \\u2019 s an important planned downtime because it lets us work on the facility. it also lets us collect critical information on the pressures that we see downhole. and that \\u2019 s causing us to have more confidence in how we think this field will get developed. let \\u2019 s continue the conversation around katmai and talk about the katmai west number two well, and why we think it \\u2019 s so important. and there \\u2019 s a lot going on in the slide, but it helps understand how we think about better defining and expanding the resource when you have a deepwater discovery like katmai. so if you go on the graphic on the left, what we \\u2019 re showing you visually is where the katmai west number one well was drilled geologically in the structure. and then on the right, we \\u2019 re trying to help you understand how that better defines lowest known oil, which defines our proved reserves. and so you have a 400 - foot pay column that helps to find proved reserves and then to better expand what the resource could be, you have to have a combination of good production data, good pressure data, and then ultimately another geological test. that next geological test is katmai west number two well. we \\u2019 re going to extend the geological column and with that information and the pressure of data and the production data, we \\u2019 re going to have a better understanding on whether the potential of 100 million barrels is available to us. we think this is a very important well, it \\u2019 s a great use of capital allocation. and to talk more about capital allocation outside our drilling program, i \\u2019 m going to hand it over to sergio. sergio maiworm : thank you, tim, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today. as tim mentioned earlier in the call, we have increased our debt reduction target from $ 400 million to $ 550 million by the end of the year. also a couple of months ago in our last earnings call, we guided the market to expect a leverage target at the end of the year of one times or below, and we \\u2019 re actually able to achieve one times at the end of the first quarter. so we \\u2019 re way ahead on our target there, and i expect that number to continue to go down as we make additional debt reductions throughout the year. at the closing of the quarternorth transaction, our debt stood at $ 1. 8 billion. and that was a combination of $ 550 million on our rbl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

(Operator Instructions) Also note today's event is being recorded.\\n\\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Brandi Hudson, Investor Relations Manager, and please go ahead.\\n\\nBrandi Hudson\\n\\nThank you. Welcome to Evolution Petroleum's fiscal Q3 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by Kelly White, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark bunch, Chief Operating Officer, and Ryan Stash, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.\\n\\nWe released our fiscal 2024 third quarter financial results after the market closed yesterday, so please refer to our earnings press release for additional information containing these results.

If you wish to listen to a webcast replay of today's call, it will be available on the Investors section of our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Kelly.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nThanks, Brandy. During our last quarterly call, we told you that we were working to increase our scale and economic efficiency. We told you that expanding regionally and further diversifying our production base are important goals for us.\\n\\nMost importantly, we also told you that the point of all this is to increase our cash flow and therefore, either extend our dividend Fairway allow us to increase our dividend or do both with our current asset base and the additions of our recent SCOOP/STACK acquisitions and participation in the operations of Chevreux.\\n\\nWe've come a long way towards achieving what we set out to accomplish and we have done so while keeping our balance sheet in our comfort zone and adding no incremental dilution, in fact, we repurchased shares during the quarter, we added to our producing asset base and our portfolio of drilling locations, we entered into two prolific areas, the Permian Basin and the Anadarko Basin.\\n\\nWe increased our oil production as a percent of sales in fact, this quarter represented a record amount of oil production net to the Company. And by the end of the quarter, we had participated in 35 newly drilled wells or wells in progress 32 in the SCOOP/STACK and three in Chevreux, which represent some of the most economic returns the Company has seen to date evolution today versus evolution a year ago looks very promising.\\n\\nOur oil production for the fiscal third quarter this year versus last year is up by approximately 19%. Our NGL production is the same and our natural gas production is down by roughly 4%.\\n\\nThese numbers only include about half of the quarter for the SCOOP/STACK acquisitions as the transaction closed on two 12 and less than two thirds of the quarter for the new Chevron wells, as all three wells were only finished being placed on production in early February and ramped up in production as frac fluid was recovered today, we have a much deeper and higher quality inventory of drilling locations versus a year ago with economics that are very compelling.\\n\\nWe believe that with our current inventory of assets we have the firepower to fund our dividend for many years to come with the potential for growth, particularly as natural gas prices recover as expected. And we certainly don't intend to risk.\\n\\nNow we're always on the lookout for the next highly accretive transaction that will benefit our shareholders from October of 2019 through February of 2020 for Evolution has participated in six major transactions, putting over $119 million to work for our shareholders.\\n\\nDuring that time, we've paid down over $41 million of borrowings, while our share count has remained virtually unchanged since we began paying dividends 10 years ago, we have returned over $3.45 per share to shareholders in cash and another $0.26 per share in share repurchases.\\n\\nThese six major transactions have added substantial volumes of proved oil, natural gas and NGLs, all of which gain this exposure into different largely uncorrelated markets, both by product and locations, many of which have recently experienced outsized favorable pricing versus other sales points.\\n\\nThese six major transactions also provide evolution with hundreds of undrilled upside locations operated by proven and experienced teams, we can either choose to participate, non-consent or even sell many of these undeveloped locations, depending on which will bring the most value to our shareholders at the time throughout the years and across many diverse transactions. Our goal remains the same as it has been since 2013.\\n\\nThe year, we paid our first of 42 and counting consecutive dividends. That goal is to maximize total shareholder returns by carefully evaluating every dollar we use to drive dividend payments, share repurchases and replenishing and or growing our cash flow producing asset base, all while avoiding significant dilution or overleveraging our balance sheet.\\n\\nI'll hand it over to Mark now who will give you an update from an operational standpoint on some of our recent actions supporting our strategy.\\n\\nJ. Mark Bunch\\n\\nThanks, Kelly. I will focus on some of our notable items since our listeners can refer to our press release and 10 Q filings for additional details our latest acquisition, SCOOP/STACK is a very exciting add to the company's portfolio. We closed on this acquisition on February 12th on a pro forma basis for third quarter net production rate was approximately 1,550 BOE per day, which was essentially flat with the production rate at the effective date of the acquisition November first, 2023.\\n\\nAlso in the effective date of the acquisition, we acquired over 300 gross drilling locations, 21 of which were decks at the close of the third quarter 19 of the 21 dogs have been placed on production, and we have agreed to participate an additional 15 gross or 0.2 net new horizontal wells across the acreage, of which 13 are currently in progress based on limited information, the completed wells have so far on average exceeded expectations.\\n\\nBased on current performance, we are confident that SCOOP STACK will be a real value add for the long term at Chevron, we brought our first two wells on production around February first, all three wells. Gross production peaked at between 303 hundred and 75 BOE per day, which is significantly better than our pre-drill estimates. On a pro forma basis for the third quarter, Chevron has produced approximately 290 BOE per day net to our interest in conjunction with the operator.\\n\\nWe are planning through the next four wells beginning in September 2024, followed by another six wells beginning in April 2025. We're very pleased with the results of our drilling program at Shaftesbury and believe we'll continue to support the dividend through a continual drilling program over the next decade.\\n\\nAgain, we would like to highlight that the addition of Chevron SCOOP/STACK, a perfect fits for our evolving strategy of both adding a long life production during commodity price downswings in adding undeveloped locations by making acquisitions through the drill bit.\\n\\nWe knew this is crucial to enhancing our ability to maintain or increase production at an attractive rate of return for years to come as for our legacy properties, we've had a successful third quarter. Jonah Field still receives a premium over Henry Hub pricing since we sell into the West Coast market and continues to perform as expected at its historical decline rate.\\n\\nThe Williston asset production increased slightly due to the one-off grasslands system downtime in the prior quarter. Even though we did experience some downtime due to winter storm in January, the Barnett Shale asset experienced some downtime due to winter storm in January as well. Subsequently, operations were resumed with production back on its historical decline rate. The operator continues to work on ways to reduce operating expenses there.\\n\\nHamilton Dome continued to perform very well, even though experienced more downtime, beauty and well workovers than usual at the beginning of the quarter, net production was only slightly down from the previous quarter. At Del high production was affected during the quarter by winter storms that impacted oil production and repeated downtime from rental turbine failures impacting NGL production, both of which were resolved by the end of the quarter.\\n\\nThe CO2 purchase pipeline was taken offline for preventative maintenance at the end of February. The operator anticipates resuming CO2 purchases in June 2024. This will reduce Del high field LOE during this time period. The field continues to inject recycled CO2 which is the bulk of the normal CO2 injection. And we do not anticipate a significant production impact from the temporarily decreased CO2 injection volumes.\\n\\nThe operators also indicated that Dell has expected to be certified as a carbon capture utilization and storage site designated for enhanced oil recovery by the summer. All in all, fiscal Q3 production increased 14% from the prior quarter to 7,209 net BOE per day with oil increasing 27% and natural gas and NGLs each increasing approximately 10% with drilling results and the contribution of the acquisitions more than offsetting normal declines, maintenance and weather-related downtime.\\n\\nI'll turn it over to Ryan to discuss the highlights of the quarter.\\n\\nRyan Stash\\n\\nThanks, Mark. As Brady mentioned, earlier, we released our earnings yesterday, which contains more information on our results. My comments will focus mainly on the highlights of the current quarter. This quarter, we had total revenues of $23 million, adjusted net income of $1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 million. Our financial results demonstrated the positive impact of our SCOOP/STACK acquisitions and Chevron drilling program as revenue and EBITDA were higher than last quarter, despite receiving lower realized prices due to the continued weakness in natural gas.\\n\\nOn the development side, we spent $2.6 million in CapEx, primarily related to the drilling and completion of the three initial wells at Chevron, where we ended the quarter with $3.1 million in cash on hand and borrowings of $42.5 million on our credit facility. Our cash balance and borrowings do not yet include the impact of net cash we expect to receive for the final purchase price adjustment on the SCOOP/STACK acquisitions.\\n\\nAs of March 31st, we recorded an interim settlement receivable of $3.3 million and expect additional cash upon the final settlement set to occur during the fourth fiscal quarter. We continue to expect to remain at or below our leverage target of one times pro forma EBITDA. We entered into oil and gas hedges during the quarter and after the quarter in order to comply with the terms of our credit facility, we also amended our credit facility to give us more flexibility regarding the mix of individual commodities we are required to hedge.\\n\\nWe now have the option to hedge 40% of oil production or 25% of oil and gas production for each individual month. Given the extremely low prices of natural gas throughout calendar year 2024, we are currently only hedging oil production for that period.\\n\\nWe also hedged natural gas beyond the required 12-month period to capitalize on the high prices available in calendar year 2025 and beyond. Our goal for our hedging program will continue to be to reduce downside commodity price risks while maintaining the maximum amount of upside available.\\n\\nAs such, we will continue to monitor the market and may add additional opportunistic hedges on the shareholder return front we paid a $0.12 dividend in March and declared another $0.12 dividend to be paid in June, which will mark our 42nd and 43rd consecutive quarterly dividends and seventh and eighth consecutive dividends at the current level. We also repurchased approximately $800,000 worth of shares during the quarter.\\n\\nI'll hand it over to Kelly now for closing comments.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nThanks, Sharon. At Evolution, we accomplish our strategy of maximizing total shareholder returns by carefully weighing the use of every dollar we put to work for all our stakeholders, always with an eye towards increasing or extending the runway of our dividend for many years to come.\\n\\nWe have a proven track record of paying dividends with stronger yields than the S&P 500 and our peers returning cash to shareholders of over $3.45 per share over the last 10 years.\\n\\nWe are building our company into one designed to cover our dividend and our capital spending even in challenging times like we see today with natural gas pricing while maintaining ample capacity to return cash to shareholders, we have built and continue to build a diverse, resilient set of assets strategically designed to facilitate and complement our consistent approach to returning cash to shareholders in building this base, our balance sheet has remained rock-solid and we've added no material dilution.\\n\\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the moderator to begin the Q&A session.\\n\\nQuestion and Answer Session\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) (technical difficulty)\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So the first question I want to ask about is so the certification for TAO high and that expectation to happen in summer that sounds more or less like a you know, reiterating a consistent payment that kind of we've heard before in terms of that time line does, was there an incremental step or just sort of it's more of a saying like it's on track and that is still the expectation. And then have you advanced any negotiations or conversations around that with the operator banks don't have.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nAnd so to answer your question, it's really steady as she goes on. The updates are no, they still expected to be in the same timeframe they did. So as far as advancing negotiations and where that's going to shake out and I know we're not there yet.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nOkay. And just kind of real quick, I don't know if you have the answer now, but you know, for Phase five for DI because I've had this thought or no speculation or wondering that, that it could sort of nudge Exxon over into having more of a desire to do Phase five because you know that's more pore space conceivably to inject CO2 into DNO and has that come up at all and conversations? And do you know if that requires additional certification or is that just you can expand that project and it's kind of automatic?\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nSo I'll answer I'll answer it this way. We are we certainly think Phase five is a very strong economic project on its own merit. And we hope that that Exxon will come to that conclusion with the additional benefit of having more pore space to inject the CO2. As for additional. I mean, it's within the field. I don't expect it wouldn't be, but I'm actually not sure on that.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nOkay. And then turning to shaver through some language jumped out at me in the release saying, you know, and I know you guys have secured these a lot of different locations that you can participate in. So it's not new per se. That's something you've been either you want to do this or I like having it on the table. But in the release, the language you say that your plans are to systematically participate in the remainder.\\n\\nSo beyond, you know, we've got four in June by two and then another six. And then the other company also expects to systematically participate in a future development block building rights now to over 600 additional horizontal well locations in aggregate.\\n\\nIs that and talking about systematic participation, does that signal or indicate any kind of a flipping of a switch or something where you tend to see later, you know, of course, if things change and you start to get some data, well, results isn't in your real SaaS, but does that kind of indicate you're at a point where you kind of feeling like gee whiz, we're kind of ready to run with us at an appropriate pace now for dividend support and so forth, but just that you want to keep doing these over and over.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nYes, really honestly, is the answer to that is we've got more data. We're more comfortable than we were at, like everything's subject to change. But as of now, we intend to systematically go with it.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nSo yes, is the answer excited about it so ago, yes. And it. Am I right in kind of picking up on that language like systematic participation is kind of suggesting a feeling or reaction to how things have been going. That's a step forward or a step incremental study? And then I got a toe in the water.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nYes, I'm more confident than a let's wait and see like what maybe we were.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\n(Operator Instructions) John White, ROTH Capital.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nGood morning and Mona. Yes, good morning and congratulations on closing the SCOOP/STACK and getting your Chevreux wells flowing back. Very nice additions to the portfolio. Wanted to see about additional detail on the SCOOP/STACK, primarily the where's the acreage, what county in the Anadarko Basin is the acreage concentrated in.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nSo I can answer that or Mark, but I mean, it's in various places throughout the SCOOP/STACK. And I would say it's got a large concentration over in Grady and Garvin. And those are those have kind of been the focus on where most of these these wells in progress are okay.\\n\\nBut I mean, truly, look, it has in a dark excuse me, Blaine Canadian Carter customer doing Garvin, Grady, Kingfisher McLean. Stephen, it's the whole SCOOP/STACK, but the biggest concentration and where the most activity is over there in sort of Grady Garvin right now.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nScott, basically, John, this is Mark by just kind of near where Norman is no high-level. I know we're greedy here and it is driven around their loss. And so it's pretty pretty spread out across across the in America.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nBut yes, I know you've said it's sort of more concentrated in that Great Eastern Grady kind of area.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nBut yes, we do have various pieces throughout and is there a concentration of operators or is that pretty diversified too? There's we have a big position with Ventiv and Continental. There's some with the EOG Marathon, Gulfport, there's probably in total somewhere around like realistically around 20 operators that you will end up dealing with. But those are the ones I mentioned are the other major ones.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nThose are those are good.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nNet add, Alex, on Continental Resources, to our assets. You mentioned it and what is the primary formation being targeted? It mainly like the Woodford, but they also look for the sick, more anything in the Mississippi needed at constant excuse me, the way they pool, there's a pool, larger sections and a lot of times section is pretty good size that they pool.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nAll right. So six, 40, yet well, actually the a lot of them now are going to be 10,000 foot laterals, so they're actually going to be 1280s.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nOkay, thank you. I know you don't give guidance with the initial results from SCOOP STACK and obviously the Chevron group results and is the feeling we should see your percentage of oil cut of total production increase over time Yes, John, we are you can see that because both the both of them are especially Chevron, is really oily and SCOOP/STACK is oilier than our current mix.\\n\\nJ. Mark Bunch\\n\\nYes. The only caveat John would just be we obviously control and have more insight into February, timing and drilling in the SCOOP STACK, depending on how gas prices. We could see some areas that have more gas content get drilled, right? Right now, they're focused more on the oil and liquids areas, which makes sense. But there is some gas there, too. Right? So that there's a little bit TBD, depends on what deal operators drill.\\n\\nJohn White\\n\\nOkay. Thanks for the additional detail. I really appreciate it, and I'll pass it back to the operator.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nBruce Brown, Brown Capital.\\n\\nBruce Brown\\n\\nGood morning, fellas. Thanks for the good work. I just had I know it you've given. No, no real guidance, but I'm just wondering if prices stay right around where they are today for like the next 12 months, which is probably not going to happen, but let's assume it does with your asset-based lending line. Pete, we paid down significantly.\\n\\nRyan Stash\\n\\nYes. So thanks, Rishi. Obviously, we're not saying guidance that really what we're looking at and to answer your question is a balance of paying down our line versus capital.\\n\\nBruce Brown\\n\\nRight. And one of the big unknowns obviously is how much capital we'll have in the SCOOP/STACK given pricing?\\n\\nRyan Stash\\n\\nYes, I would say we're generating enough cash to significantly pay down, but we may choose to spend more and reinvest in CapEx and pay the line down a little bit slower, but we're certainly going to remain below our target of one times EBITDA on, as I mentioned, from a cash flow perspective, yes, we're generating plenty of cash to be able to pay down. If we do have capital projects that we think a really attractive that will probably put some capital to as well.\\n\\nBruce Brown\\n\\nAnd do you have any comment on additional capital projects in the Williston?\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nSure. So we are working with the operator, there's foundation. What's interesting is that area is you're talking about drilling new wells. We're actually getting kind of excited. It's starting to get drilled and the activity is moving towards us, um, so we're going to kind of wait and see and look at look how things can move towards us there. So we're getting incrementally more excited about that area as far as other projects within the field. And I think it's just general workovers, Mark?\\n\\nJ. Mark Bunch\\n\\nYes, just yes, just general work co-general picks up for us and did some electrification in some areas that will improve efficiency, reduce operating cost. But you don't know no wells planned to be drilled right now, at least like on the lateral. They vary.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nDonovan Schafer, Northland Capital.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nSorry about that. Okay. So talking about organic growth, kind of the levers that you guys have to pull despite we've got the Williston and the SCOOP/STACK. Well, I guess?\\n\\nYes, you've got some. And there I can't remember if you're in a position to accelerate on the gas or not, that may not be that, but there's like pubs there and then you've got them, you know, the Chevreux. So the question is, do you feel like there's a need to kind of add any more the organic growth potential?\\n\\nYes, you M&A, has that or do you feel like, given your size as a company and kind of what you see from flow funds, CapEx and other things over that over the next say, 12 months or so, do you feel like you're kind of pretty content pretty good. You've got everything we serve need unless something just really opportunistic comes along. And I think you said in the SCOOP/STACK, you've seen more things coming across your desk or more people kind of pitching things. So maybe if there's a great opportunity, but otherwise in terms of what you need in your portfolio for any type of organic growth potential and using using more as a head, you just kind of how you set there now?\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nHey, thanks, Donavon this Kelly. So the answer is we had a definite focus to make sure we added that arrow to our quiver, right? And we've said we've come a long way to accomplishing that. But along with everything else, you're never done.\\n\\nSo if the next deal that comes along is pure PDP and it fits wonderfully with our portfolio, then that's that's the that's the deal we're going to do if it's highly accretive for us. If the next one comes along and it does have an organic growth piece, we're certainly going to absolutely consider it.\\n\\nSo again, it's like you said, if it's the right deal and it's really accretive for our shareholders. For sure. It is I would say it's not as much of a push as it might have been prior to these last two acquisitions or partnerships, but it's certainly never off the table.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nOkay, that's good. And kind of related to this, I think Mark made the comment with Chevreux and maybe there's also reference to the SCOOP and STACK. But just with those come, the combination of those that's extended and the dividend yield helps the dividend coverage for a decade or more, something like that. And so I'm curious if there's any kind of quantification if you give I mean, I could ask it in the form of like gee whiz.\\n\\nCould you do a dividend increase or something, but that's, you know, this is sort of everything you can't really comment on. I know you guys place dividend protection first, in any case. So is there any kind of quantification or analysis or a sense? And maybe now is talking about shaver from this kind of systematic participation standpoint, do you have an internal sense of how much how many extra years these have gotten? You are a stress test test case where you say, gee, we think we have the dividend covered as it is for X number of years? Is there any color, anything you there? David, helpful.\\n\\nRyan Stash\\n\\nYes. I mean so this is Ryan Dimebon. Yes. Look, I mean, I don't think we can comment specifically on, as you mentioned, certain long-term sort of guidance here. But what I will tell you is, you know, obviously you can look at the assets themselves and how much cash flow they bring and you can sort of model out how much we think should remain in the future. So from there, you can obviously see quite a bit of dividend coverage?\\n\\nYou know, I think as we're looking over at least the near term, we're going to generate a good amount of cash flow and we have potential uses, right? One of those is increasing the dividend. However, others are also reinvesting in the business right now that we have this organic growth like we have more capital to put to work and we have in the past, right, whereas in the past, we could have just return it all to shareholders now will probably take some of that capital and put it back into the business to keep sustaining our production level.\\n\\nSo I know I'm not exactly answering your question, but just just highlight, you know that at the Board level, we certainly look at every single dollar we put to work and whether that makes sense to reinvest in the business, buy stock, raise a dividend. Obviously, our goal is to keep it for a sustainable business at our base dividend or better for a long period of time.\\n\\nDonovan Schafer\\n\\nAnd I suppose because you guys Dolle, you characteristically do and significantly less hedging than a lot of other kind of oil and gas companies in practice that all that whole pathway just sort of becomes accelerated with part with upward commodity price cycles.\\n\\nAnd is that correct that you would in that situation where you have natural gas recoveries materially or oil pipelines, you know, in some material way that just puts you in a position to kind of double down where you think it makes sense and then add and layer in more assets that give you the kind of number of years of coverage you'd want. But then also at a higher dividend because like you've gotten this almost like a windfall of sorts with what commodity prices may do on the upside to kind of the right way to think about it?\\n\\nRyan Stash\\n\\nYes. I mean, except that I would say, obviously, we are we're looking out multiple years. So let's take, for instance, when we saw gas not too long ago, run up past five, a $9, right? You saw us actually we help to pay down some of our debt repayment at that point, and we bought back quite a bit of share. So again, the dividend is just one tool.\\n\\nAnd so if we were to see if we saw a price recovery that we feel is sustained for a long period of time, then that's one thing. But if it's natural gas, all it takes is really well known as a warm winter to and all bets are off, right? So it's hard to really forecast on gas at a $5 level for a long term. But if we were to get running again here than we could look to, again accelerate debt paydown, we could buy back some additional shares, Tom, even look at acquisition opportunities, right?\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nSo again, it would be all of those things would examine, I mean, just okay to follow on and carry on with where he's going with our base sort of commodity price expectations. We said many times where we think we can absolutely have great dividend coverage for many years to come with something above that. It is it is cash flow with which we will make a prudent decision at the time what to do with it.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, once again showing no questions at this time, I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.\\n\\nKelly Loyd\\n\\nWe just want to say thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any further questions, feel free to contact a brandy who's our IR Manager. So thank you very much.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining us may now disconnect your lines.\""
