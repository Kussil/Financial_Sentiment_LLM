In late 1999, the FTC allowed Exxon and Mobil to reunite, creating Exxon Mobil Corp., Investor contact\\nthe largest publicly-traded integrated oil company in the world aside from Saudi Aramco (the national oil S. A. Littleton (972-940-6000)\\ncompany of Saudi Arabia). ExxonMobil's businesses include oil and natural gas exploration and production\\n($10.0 billion in 2019 segment earnings excluding one-time items, versus $13.8 billion in 2018); refining Office\\nand marketing ($2.3 billion, $5.1 billion); chemicals ($0.6 billion, $3.1 billion); and other operations, such as 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75039-2298\\nelectric power generation, coal and minerals. The combined earnings of $12.9 billion in 2019, not including\\none-time items, was thus down 41% versus 2018\\u2019s $22.0 billion in pre-adjustment earnings. Telephone\\n972-940-6000\\nIncluding non-consolidated equity interest, proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019 stood at 22.4\\nbillion BOE (65% liquids; 66% developed). Oil and gas production in 2019 fell 3.8%, to 3.83 million barrels of Fax\\noil equivalent per day (BOE/d; 59% liquids). At their most recent annual Investor Day event (March 2020), 972-940-6143\\nXOM expected production, ex-divestitures, to be about 3.9 million boe/d in 2020, but with potential to rise to\\n5.0 mmb/d by 2024. Website\\ncorporate.exxonmobil.com\\nIn 2019, total liquids production was 2.39 mmb/d, but very dispersed across regions. Asia-Pacific led the\\nway with 0.79 mmb/d, U.S. production of liquids was next highest with 0.65 mmb/d, while Canada/Other\\nAmericas added 0.47 mmb/d. On the natural gas front, XOM generated total production of 9.4 billion cubic Officers\\nfeet per day (bcf/d), with Asia again leading the way (52%) and the U.S. next at 30%.

Weldon\\nthe 2014 oil crisis, XOM pulled in the reins considerably. In 2019, capital investment was $31 billion, and\\ninitial guidance for 2020 originally indicated $32 billion, before being slashed 30% to about $23 billion. We\\nthink the key catalysts for capex over the next five years will be the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as its Domicile Auditor\\nGolden Pass LNG development in the U.S. Gulf Coast, although the Permian Basin in 2020 will likely see New Jersey PricewaterhouseCoopers\\nsignificant cuts LLP\\nFounded\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 1870\\nacres of land in the Permian Basin from the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in\\nXOM stock and possible contingency payments of up to $1.0 billion in cash, based on performance, starting Employees\\nin 2020. The deal doubles XOM's prior asset base in the Permian, which we view as the most economically 74,900\\nviable region for U.S. unconventional shale oil development.\\nStockholders\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including\\n352,585\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. We think XOM's technical expertise will unlock additional XTO resource potential in\\nthe coming years. We do note, however, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion\\nimpairment charge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas\\nprices. XTO's production is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge\\nreflects, to some degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term. Total distributions to shareholders in 2019 stood at $14.7 billion, up $0.9\\nbillion over those in 2018, including both share repurchases as well as quarterly dividends.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion\\nshares after the Exxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019, XOM had a diluted share count of 4.28 billion shares, flat versus the end of 2018.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Phillips 66 is a downstream energy company with three businesses: refining and Investor contact\\nmarketing, midstream, and chemicals. On May 1, 2012, ConocoPhillips (COP) separated its downstream J. A. Dietert (281 293 6600)\\nbusiness to create a new publicly traded, independent company, Phillips 66, via a tax-free spin-off (COP\\nshareholders received 1 PSX share for every 2 COP shares). PSX\\u2019s assets include 13 refineries with a net Office\\ncrude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day, 7,520 branded marketing outlets, 22,000 miles of pipeline 2331 CityWest Boulevard, Houston, Texas, 77042\\nsystems, and 6.7 billion cubic feet per day of gross natural gas processing capacity. PSX has four operating\\nsegments. In the four full years prior to the pandemic (2016 through 2019), PSX generated an average Telephone\\npretax net income of about $4.3 billion per year. Owing to the pandemic, however, PSX absorbed a pretax net 281 293 6600\\nloss of almost $5.0 billion in 2020. As of April 2021, consensus estimates for PSX suggest 2021 pretax\\nFax\\nincome of about $1.5 billion, before advancing further to $4.0 billion in 2022. We think the pandemic, which\\nN/A\\ndecimated refining economics, is likely to give way to a gradual recovery in energy demand, which should\\nultimately enable PSX\\u2019s refining business to recover. Website\\nThe largest segment by assets is the Refining segment (a pretax loss of $6.2 billion in 2020, versus a $2.0 www.phillips66.com\\nbillion pretax profit in 2019). The refining segment buys, sells, and refines crude oil and other feedstocks in\\nits 13 refineries. While geographically diverse and totaling 2.2 million barrels per day of throughput capacity, Officers\\nthe U.S. Gulf Coast represents the largest portion at 784,000 b/d. Approximately 87% of total throughput Chairman & CEO Executive VP of Legal &\\ncapacity is located in the U.S., with international locations that include the U.K. and Germany. G. C. Garland Government Affairs,\\nSecond largest is the Midstream segment (a pretax operating loss of $9 million, versus a pretax operating General Counsel and\\nprofit of $684 million), consisting of three primary business lines. The Transportation business line Chairman & CEO Corporate Secretary\\ntransports crude oil and other feedstocks to PSX\\u2019s refineries, including finished product terminals, storage G. C.

DCP Midstream also owned or operated nine NGL\\nfractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities, a propane wholesale marketing\\nExecutive VP of Finance &\\nbusiness, and NGL pipeline assets.\\nCFO\\nThe third-largest segment is Marketing & Specialties ($1.45 billion, $1.43 billion). The M&S segment K. J. Mitchell\\npurchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products such as gasolines, distillates, and aviation\\nfuels, mainly in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, the segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of\\nBoard Members\\nspecialty products, such as lubricants and power generation products. In the U.S., as of December 31, 2020,\\nC.

CPChem approved the construction of an ethane\\ncracker and polyethylene facility in the U.S. Gulf Coast, completed in 2017. Founded\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In March 2020, the development and construction of PSX\\u2019s Red Oak 1875\\nPipeline system and Sweeny Frac 4, as well as Phillips 66 Partners\\u2019 Liberty Pipeline system projects, were\\nEmployees\\ndeferred as a result of the challenging business environment. In the third quarter of 2020, the Red Oak\\n14,000\\nPipeline project was canceled. In 2021, PSX resumed construction of Sweeny Frac 4, with expected\\ncompletion by the second half of 2021. Stockholders\\nIn 2013, PSX formed Phillips 66 Partners LP, a master limited partnership, to own, operate, develop, and 31,692\\nacquire primarily fee-based crude oil, refined petroleum product, and NGL pipelines and terminals, as well as\\nother transportation and midstream assets. Effective March 1, 2014, PSX contributed to Phillips 66 Partners\\ncertain transportation, terminaling, and storage assets for a total consideration of $700 million, and\\nsubsequently made additional contributions, including logistics assets (December 2014; $340 million), its\\n33% interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills (March 2015; $1.01 billion), and its 40% stake in Bayou\\nBridge Pipeline (December 2015; $70 million). As of the end of 2020, PSX owned a 74% limited partnership\\nand a noneconomic general partnership stake in Phillips 66 Partners, while its public unitholders owned a\\n26% stake in the limited partner interest and 13.8 million convertible preferred units.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2020, net debt-to-capital stood at 38%, slightly above the peer\\nmedian. For 2021, PSX budgeted $1.7 billion in capital spending, including $1.1 billion in sustaining capital.\\nThe lion\\u2019s share of the planned 2021 capital spending is targeted at the Refining segment ($776 million)\\nand the Midstream segment ($615 million).

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.) is a global oil & gas exploration & Investor contact\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), J. R. Wilson (212 997 8500)\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES as a pure-play upstream oil & gas company. Office\\nAs of the end of 2021, HES had proved reserves of 1.31 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe), up 12% from 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 40th Floor, New York, New\\nthe end of 2020. Proved reserves skew 79% liquids/21% natural gas. Geographically, 887 million boe of the York, 10036\\nend of 2021 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (213 million boe),\\nTelephone\\nMalaysia (93 million boe), and Other (116 million boe).\\n212 997 8500\\nDuring 2021, HES averaged 315,000 boe/d of production (69% liquids, 31% natural gas), down 5% from\\n2020. For 2022, as of July, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by 5% to Fax\\n330,120 boe/d. N/A\\nHES held approximately 462,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2021. From February 2021 Website\\nto August 2021, HES operated two rigs in this region, and added a third rig in September 2021. The www.hess.com\\ncompany drilled 63 wells in 2021 in this region, and brought a total of 51 rigs on production. As of July 2022,\\nHES added a fourth rig in the region, to drill 95 wells, and bring 80+ wells on production for FY 2022. Overall,\\nOfficers\\nit expects Bakken production to average 153,000 boe/d in 2022, a decline of 3,000 boe/d from 2021 levels.\\nSenior Vice President of Executive VP, General\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nTechnology & Services Counsel, Corporate\\nWestern countries has led to banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nR. Lynch Secretary & Chief\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\nCompliance Officer\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to CEO & Director T. B. Goodell\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from J. B. Hess\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May Executive VP & CFO\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long Independent Chairman J. P. Rielly\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European J. H. Quigley\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with its growing supply COO and President of\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand. Exploration & Production\\nG. P. Hill\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final Board Members\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent D. McManus L. Glatch\\nelection.\\nE. E. Holiday L. S. Coleman\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\nJ. B. Hess M. S. Lipschultz\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nJ. H. Quigley R. J. McGuire\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day. K. F. Ovelmen T. J. Checki\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the K. O. Meyers W. G. Schrader\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nDomicile Auditor\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nDelaware Ernst & Young LLP\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets; Founded\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its 1920\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES Employees\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES 1,545\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\nStockholders\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2021 stood at $2.7 billion, up 12% from 2021. HES ended 2021 with\\n2,725\\na net debt to capital ratio of 40%, above the ~30% peer average, with no major principal repayment due until\\n2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from July 12, 2022,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $104/b in 2022 and $94/b in 2023.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

In January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 New Jersey N/A\\nacres of land in the Permian Basin from the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in\\nFounded\\nXOM stock and possible contingency payments of up to $1.0 billion in cash, based on performance.

Employees\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including 74,900\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\nStockholders\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. However, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion impairment\\nN/A\\ncharge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s\\nproduction is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to\\nsome degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges\\nbecame more severe in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets\\nin the U.S., as well as assets in Canada and Argentina.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had a debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year-end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term.

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.) is a global oil & gas exploration & Investor contact\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), J. R. Wilson (212 997 8500)\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES as a pure-play upstream oil & gas company. Office\\nAs of the end of 2021, HES had proved reserves of 1.31 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe), up 12% from 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 40th Floor, New York, New\\nthe end of 2020. Proved reserves skew 79% liquids/21% natural gas. Geographically, 887 million boe of the York, 10036\\nend of 2021 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (213 million boe),\\nTelephone\\nMalaysia (93 million boe), and Other (116 million boe).\\n212 997 8500\\nDuring 2021, HES averaged 315,000 boe/d of production (69% liquids, 31% natural gas), down 5% from\\n2020. For 2022, as of July, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by 5% to Fax\\n330,120 boe/d. N/A\\nHES held approximately 462,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2021. From February 2021 Website\\nto August 2021, HES operated two rigs in this region, and added a third rig in September 2021. The www.hess.com\\ncompany drilled 63 wells in 2021 in this region, and brought a total of 51 rigs on production. As of July 2022,\\nHES added a fourth rig in the region, to drill 95 wells, and bring 80+ wells on production for FY 2022. Overall,\\nOfficers\\nit expects Bakken production to average 153,000 boe/d in 2022, a decline of 3,000 boe/d from 2021 levels.\\nSenior Vice President of Executive VP, General\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nTechnology & Services Counsel, Corporate\\nWestern countries has led to banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nR. Lynch Secretary & Chief\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\nCompliance Officer\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to CEO & Director T. B. Goodell\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from J. B. Hess\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May Executive VP & CFO\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long Independent Chairman J. P. Rielly\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European J. H. Quigley\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with its growing supply COO and President of\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand. Exploration & Production\\nG. P. Hill\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final Board Members\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent D. McManus L. Glatch\\nelection.\\nE. E. Holiday L. S. Coleman\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\nJ. B. Hess M. S. Lipschultz\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nJ. H. Quigley R. J. McGuire\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day. K. F. Ovelmen T. J. Checki\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the K. O. Meyers W. G. Schrader\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nDomicile Auditor\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nDelaware Ernst & Young LLP\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets; Founded\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its 1920\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES Employees\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES 1,545\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\nStockholders\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2021 stood at $2.7 billion, up 12% from 2021. HES ended 2021 with\\n2,725\\na net debt to capital ratio of 40%, above the ~30% peer average, with no major principal repayment due until\\n2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from July 12, 2022,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $104/b in 2022 and $94/b in 2023.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

In late 1999, the FTC allowed Exxon and Mobil to reunite, creating Exxon Mobil Corp., Investor contact\\nthe largest publicly-traded integrated oil company in the world aside from Saudi Aramco (the national oil S. A. Littleton (972-940-6000)\\ncompany of Saudi Arabia). ExxonMobil\\u2019s businesses include oil and natural gas exploration and production\\n($10.0 billion in 2019 segment earnings excluding one-time items, versus $13.8 billion in 2018); refining Office\\nand marketing ($2.3 billion, $5.1 billion); chemicals ($0.6 billion, $3.1 billion); and other operations, such as 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75039-2298\\nelectric power generation, coal, and minerals. The combined earnings of $12.9 billion in 2019, not including\\none-time items, was thus down 41% versus 2018\\u2019s $22.0 billion in pre-adjustment earnings. Telephone\\n972-940-6000\\nIncluding non-consolidated equity interest, proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019 stood at 22.4\\nbillion BOE (65% liquids; 66% developed). Oil and gas production in 2019 fell 3.8%, to 3.83 million barrels of Fax\\noil equivalent per day (BOE/d; 59% liquids). At their most recent annual Investor Day event (March 2020), 972-940-6143\\nXOM expected production, ex-divestitures, to be about 3.9 million boe/d in 2020, but with the potential to\\nrise to 5.0 mmb/d by 2024. Website\\ncorporate.exxonmobil.com\\nIn 2019, total liquids production was 2.39 mmb/d but very dispersed across regions. Asia-Pacific led the way\\nwith 0.79 mmb/d, U.S. production of liquids was next highest with 0.65 mmb/d, while Canada/Other\\nAmericas added 0.47 mmb/d. On the natural gas front, XOM generated total production of 9.4 billion cubic Officers\\nfeet per day (bcf/d), with Asia again leading the way (52%) and the U.S. next at 30%.

Capital spending peaked in 2013 at $42.5 billion, but in the immediate aftermath of J. L. Hooley W. C. Weldon\\nthe 2014 oil crisis, XOM pulled in the reins considerably. In 2019, capital investment was $31 billion, and K. C. Frazier W. Z.

We think the key catalysts for capex over the next five years will be the Permian Basin and Guyana,\\nas well as its Golden Pass LNG development in the U.S. Gulf Coast, although the Permian Basin in 2021 will\\nlikely see significant cuts Domicile Auditor\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 New Jersey N/A\\nacres of land in the Permian Basin from the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in\\nFounded\\nXOM stock and possible contingency payments of up to $1.0 billion in cash, based on performance. The deal\\n1870\\ndoubles XOM\\u2019s prior asset base in the Permian, which we view as the most economically viable region for\\nU.S. unconventional shale oil development. Employees\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including 74,900\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\nStockholders\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. However, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion impairment\\nN/A\\ncharge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s\\nproduction is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to\\nsome degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges\\nbecame more severe in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets\\nin the U.S., as well as assets in Canada and Argentina.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had a debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year-end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term. Total distributions to shareholders in 2019 stood at $14.7 billion, up $0.9\\nbillion over those in 2018, including both share repurchases as well as quarterly dividends.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion\\nshares after the Exxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019, XOM had a diluted share count of 4.28 billion shares, flat versus the end of 2018.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.) is a global oil & gas exploration & Investor contact\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC), J. R. Wilson (212 997 8500)\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES as a pure-play upstream oil & gas company. Office\\nAs of the end of 2021, HES had proved reserves of 1.31 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe), up 12% from 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 40th Floor, New York, New\\nthe end of 2020. Proved reserves skew 79% liquids/21% natural gas. Geographically, 887 million boe of the York, 10036\\nend of 2021 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (213 million boe),\\nTelephone\\nMalaysia (93 million boe), and Other (116 million boe).\\n212 997 8500\\nDuring 2021, HES averaged 315,000 boe/d of production (69% liquids, 31% natural gas), down 5% from\\n2020. For 2022, as of July, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by 5% to Fax\\n330,120 boe/d. N/A\\nHES held approximately 462,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2021. From February 2021 Website\\nto August 2021, HES operated two rigs in this region, and added a third rig in September 2021. The www.hess.com\\ncompany drilled 63 wells in 2021 in this region, and brought a total of 51 rigs on production. As of July 2022,\\nHES added a fourth rig in the region, to drill 95 wells, and bring 80+ wells on production for FY 2022. Overall,\\nOfficers\\nit expects Bakken production to average 153,000 boe/d in 2022, a decline of 3,000 boe/d from 2021 levels.\\nSenior Vice President of Executive VP, General\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nTechnology & Services Counsel, Corporate\\nWestern countries has led to banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nR. Lynch Secretary & Chief\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\nCompliance Officer\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to CEO & Director T. B. Goodell\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from J. B. Hess\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May Executive VP & CFO\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long Independent Chairman J. P. Rielly\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European J. H. Quigley\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with its growing supply COO and President of\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand. Exploration & Production\\nG. P. Hill\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final Board Members\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent D. McManus L. Glatch\\nelection.\\nE. E. Holiday L. S. Coleman\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\nJ. B. Hess M. S. Lipschultz\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nJ. H. Quigley R. J. McGuire\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day. K. F. Ovelmen T. J. Checki\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the K. O. Meyers W. G. Schrader\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nDomicile Auditor\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nDelaware Ernst & Young LLP\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets; Founded\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its 1920\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES Employees\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES 1,545\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\nStockholders\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2021 stood at $2.7 billion, up 12% from 2021. HES ended 2021 with\\n2,725\\na net debt to capital ratio of 40%, above the ~30% peer average, with no major principal repayment due until\\n2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from July 12, 2022,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $104/b in 2022 and $94/b in 2023.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Employees\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including 74,900\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\nStockholders\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. However, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion impairment\\nN/A\\ncharge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s\\nproduction is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to\\nsome degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges\\nbecame more severe in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets\\nin the U.S., as well as assets in Canada and Argentina.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had a debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year-end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term. Total distributions to shareholders in 2019 stood at $14.7 billion, up $0.9\\nbillion over those in 2018, including both share repurchases as well as quarterly dividends.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion\\nshares after the Exxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019, XOM had a diluted share count of 4.28 billion shares, flat versus the end of 2018.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

On August 2, 2022, MPLX announced its board of directors approved a $1.0\\u00a0billion unit repurchase authorization. The unit repurchase authorizations have no expiration date. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, accelerated unit repurchases, tender offers or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be discontinued at any time.Total unit repurchases were as follows for the respective periods:As of September\\u00a030, 2023, MPLX had approximately $846 million remaining under its unit repurchase authorization.Redemption of the Series B Preferred UnitsOn February 15, 2023, MPLX exercised its right to redeem all of its 600,000 outstanding preferred units (the \\u201cSeries B preferred units\\u201d). MPLX paid unitholders the Series B preferred unit redemption price of $1,000 per unit. The final semi-annual distribution on the Series B preferred units was paid on February 15, 2023 in the usual manner.The excess of the total redemption price of $600\\u00a0million paid to Series B preferred unitholders over the carrying value of the Series B preferred units on the redemption date resulted in a $2\\u00a0million net reduction to retained earnings.
