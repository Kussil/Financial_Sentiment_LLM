In late 1999, the FTC allowed Exxon and Mobil to reunite, creating Exxon Mobil Corp., Investor contact\\nthe largest publicly-traded integrated oil company in the world aside from Saudi Aramco (the national oil S. A. Littleton (972-940-6000)\\ncompany of Saudi Arabia). ExxonMobil's businesses include oil and natural gas exploration and production\\n($10.0 billion in 2019 segment earnings excluding one-time items, versus $13.8 billion in 2018); refining Office\\nand marketing ($2.3 billion, $5.1 billion); chemicals ($0.6 billion, $3.1 billion); and other operations, such as 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75039-2298\\nelectric power generation, coal and minerals. The combined earnings of $12.9 billion in 2019, not including\\none-time items, was thus down 41% versus 2018\\u2019s $22.0 billion in pre-adjustment earnings. Telephone\\n972-940-6000\\nIncluding non-consolidated equity interest, proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019 stood at 22.4\\nbillion BOE (65% liquids; 66% developed). Oil and gas production in 2019 fell 3.8%, to 3.83 million barrels of Fax\\noil equivalent per day (BOE/d; 59% liquids). At their most recent annual Investor Day event (March 2020), 972-940-6143\\nXOM expected production, ex-divestitures, to be about 3.9 million boe/d in 2020, but with potential to rise to\\n5.0 mmb/d by 2024. Website\\ncorporate.exxonmobil.com\\nIn 2019, total liquids production was 2.39 mmb/d, but very dispersed across regions. Asia-Pacific led the\\nway with 0.79 mmb/d, U.S. production of liquids was next highest with 0.65 mmb/d, while Canada/Other\\nAmericas added 0.47 mmb/d. On the natural gas front, XOM generated total production of 9.4 billion cubic Officers\\nfeet per day (bcf/d), with Asia again leading the way (52%) and the U.S. next at 30%. Senior VP & Principal VP & General Counsel\\nFinancial Officer C. S. Morford\\nOn the downstream side in 2019, XOM generated total refining throughput of 3.98 million barrels per day\\nA. P. Swiger\\n(mmb/d), down from 4.29 mmb/d in 2018. The regional breakdown of 2019 refining throughput consists of\\nU.S. refining (38%), Europe (33%), Asia-Pacific (15%), Canada (8.9%) and Other (4.1%).

F. Braly S. A. Kandarian\\nMARKET PROFILE. XOM maintains the largest portfolio of proved reserves and production in North America,\\nD. R. Oberhelman S. J. Palmisano\\nand is the biggest net producer of oil and gas in Europe. Through wholly owned ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. and\\nits 69.6%-owned affiliate Imperial Oil, XOM is one of the largest oil and gas producers in Canada and is D. W. Woods S. K. Avery\\nbuilding the Kearl oil sands project. J. L. Hooley U. M. Burns\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY. Capital spending peaked in 2013 at $42.5 billion, but in the immediate aftermath of K. C. Frazier W. C. Weldon\\nthe 2014 oil crisis, XOM pulled in the reins considerably. In 2019, capital investment was $31 billion, and\\ninitial guidance for 2020 originally indicated $32 billion, before being slashed 30% to about $23 billion. We\\nthink the key catalysts for capex over the next five years will be the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as its Domicile Auditor\\nGolden Pass LNG development in the U.S. Gulf Coast, although the Permian Basin in 2020 will likely see New Jersey PricewaterhouseCoopers\\nsignificant cuts LLP\\nFounded\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 1870\\nacres of land in the Permian Basin from the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in\\nXOM stock and possible contingency payments of up to $1.0 billion in cash, based on performance, starting Employees\\nin 2020. The deal doubles XOM's prior asset base in the Permian, which we view as the most economically 74,900\\nviable region for U.S. unconventional shale oil development.\\nStockholders\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including\\n352,585\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. We think XOM's technical expertise will unlock additional XTO resource potential in\\nthe coming years. We do note, however, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion\\nimpairment charge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas\\nprices. XTO's production is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge\\nreflects, to some degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term. Total distributions to shareholders in 2019 stood at $14.7 billion, up $0.9\\nbillion over those in 2018, including both share repurchases as well as quarterly dividends.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion\\nshares after the Exxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019, XOM had a diluted share count of 4.28 billion shares, flat versus the end of 2018.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Phillips 66 is a downstream energy company with three businesses: refining and Investor contact\\nmarketing, midstream, and chemicals. On May 1, 2012, ConocoPhillips (COP) separated its downstream J. A. Dietert (281 293 6600)\\nbusiness to create a new publicly traded, independent company, Phillips 66, via a tax-free spin-off (COP\\nshareholders received 1 PSX share for every 2 COP shares). PSX\\u2019s assets include 13 refineries with a net Office\\ncrude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day, 7,520 branded marketing outlets, 22,000 miles of pipeline 2331 CityWest Boulevard, Houston, Texas, 77042\\nsystems, and 6.7 billion cubic feet per day of gross natural gas processing capacity. PSX has four operating\\nsegments. In the four full years prior to the pandemic (2016 through 2019), PSX generated an average Telephone\\npretax net income of about $4.3 billion per year. Owing to the pandemic, however, PSX absorbed a pretax net 281 293 6600\\nloss of almost $5.0 billion in 2020. As of April 2021, consensus estimates for PSX suggest 2021 pretax\\nFax\\nincome of about $1.5 billion, before advancing further to $4.0 billion in 2022. We think the pandemic, which\\nN/A\\ndecimated refining economics, is likely to give way to a gradual recovery in energy demand, which should\\nultimately enable PSX\\u2019s refining business to recover.

In late 1999, the FTC allowed Exxon and Mobil to reunite, creating Exxon Mobil Corp., Investor contact\\nthe largest publicly-traded integrated oil company in the world aside from Saudi Aramco (the national oil S. A. Littleton (972-940-6000)\\ncompany of Saudi Arabia). ExxonMobil's businesses include oil and natural gas exploration and production\\n($10.0 billion in 2019 segment earnings excluding one-time items, versus $13.8 billion in 2018); refining Office\\nand marketing ($2.3 billion, $5.1 billion); chemicals ($0.6 billion, $3.1 billion); and other operations, such as 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75039-2298\\nelectric power generation, coal and minerals. The combined earnings of $12.9 billion in 2019, not including\\none-time items, was thus down 41% versus 2018\\u2019s $22.0 billion in pre-adjustment earnings. Telephone\\n972-940-6000\\nIncluding non-consolidated equity interest, proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019 stood at 22.4\\nbillion BOE (65% liquids; 66% developed). Oil and gas production in 2019 fell 3.8%, to 3.83 million barrels of Fax\\noil equivalent per day (BOE/d; 59% liquids). At their most recent annual Investor Day event (March 2020), 972-940-6143\\nXOM expected production, ex-divestitures, to be about 3.9 million boe/d in 2020, but with potential to rise to\\n5.0 mmb/d by 2024. Website\\ncorporate.exxonmobil.com\\nIn 2019, total liquids production was 2.39 mmb/d, but very dispersed across regions. Asia-Pacific led the\\nway with 0.79 mmb/d, U.S. production of liquids was next highest with 0.65 mmb/d, while Canada/Other\\nAmericas added 0.47 mmb/d. On the natural gas front, XOM generated total production of 9.4 billion cubic Officers\\nfeet per day (bcf/d), with Asia again leading the way (52%) and the U.S. next at 30%. Senior VP & Principal VP & General Counsel\\nFinancial Officer C. S. Morford\\nOn the downstream side in 2019, XOM generated total refining throughput of 3.98 million barrels per day\\nA. P. Swiger\\n(mmb/d), down from 4.29 mmb/d in 2018. The regional breakdown of 2019 refining throughput consists of\\nU.S. refining (38%), Europe (33%), Asia-Pacific (15%), Canada (8.9%) and Other (4.1%).

F. Braly S. A. Kandarian\\nMARKET PROFILE. XOM maintains the largest portfolio of proved reserves and production in North America,\\nD. R. Oberhelman S. J. Palmisano\\nand is the biggest net producer of oil and gas in Europe. Through wholly owned ExxonMobil Canada Ltd. and\\nits 69.6%-owned affiliate Imperial Oil, XOM is one of the largest oil and gas producers in Canada and is D. W. Woods S. K. Avery\\nbuilding the Kearl oil sands project. J. L. Hooley U. M. Burns\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY. Capital spending peaked in 2013 at $42.5 billion, but in the immediate aftermath of K. C. Frazier W. C. Weldon\\nthe 2014 oil crisis, XOM pulled in the reins considerably. In 2019, capital investment was $31 billion, and\\ninitial guidance for 2020 originally indicated $32 billion, before being slashed 30% to about $23 billion. We\\nthink the key catalysts for capex over the next five years will be the Permian Basin and Guyana, as well as its Domicile Auditor\\nGolden Pass LNG development in the U.S. Gulf Coast, although the Permian Basin in 2020 will likely see New Jersey PricewaterhouseCoopers\\nsignificant cuts LLP\\nFounded\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 1870\\nacres of land in the Permian Basin from the Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in\\nXOM stock and possible contingency payments of up to $1.0 billion in cash, based on performance, starting Employees\\nin 2020. The deal doubles XOM's prior asset base in the Permian, which we view as the most economically 74,900\\nviable region for U.S. unconventional shale oil development.\\nStockholders\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including\\n352,585\\n$10.0 billion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of\\n$11.51 per proved BOE. We think XOM's technical expertise will unlock additional XTO resource potential in\\nthe coming years. We do note, however, that in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2.0 billion\\nimpairment charge on some of its dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas\\nprices. XTO's production is approximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge\\nreflects, to some degree, reduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2019, XOM had debt of $46.9 billion (up $9.1 billion from year end\\n2018) and cash balances of $3.1 billion (up just $0.1 billion). We think XOM has historically enjoyed above-\\naverage returns versus peers, but with several headwinds looming for 2020, we think returns may be\\nrelatively weak in the near term. Total distributions to shareholders in 2019 stood at $14.7 billion, up $0.9\\nbillion over those in 2018, including both share repurchases as well as quarterly dividends.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares outstanding at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion\\nshares after the Exxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of\\nDecember 31, 2019, XOM had a diluted share count of 4.28 billion shares, flat versus the end of 2018.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Phillips 66 is a downstream energy company with three businesses: refining and Investor contact\\nmarketing, midstream, and chemicals. On May 1, 2012, ConocoPhillips (COP) separated its downstream J. A. Dietert (281 293 6600)\\nbusiness to create a new publicly traded, independent company, Phillips 66, via a tax-free spin-off (COP\\nshareholders received 1 PSX share for every 2 COP shares). PSX\\u2019s assets include 13 refineries with a net Office\\ncrude oil capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day, 7,520 branded marketing outlets, 22,000 miles of pipeline 2331 CityWest Boulevard, Houston, Texas, 77042\\nsystems, and 6.7 billion cubic feet per day of gross natural gas processing capacity. PSX has four operating\\nsegments. In the four full years prior to the pandemic (2016 through 2019), PSX generated an average Telephone\\npretax net income of about $4.3 billion per year. Owing to the pandemic, however, PSX absorbed a pretax net 281 293 6600\\nloss of almost $5.0 billion in 2020. As of April 2021, consensus estimates for PSX suggest 2021 pretax\\nFax\\nincome of about $1.5 billion, before advancing further to $4.0 billion in 2022. We think the pandemic, which\\nN/A\\ndecimated refining economics, is likely to give way to a gradual recovery in energy demand, which should\\nultimately enable PSX\\u2019s refining business to recover.
