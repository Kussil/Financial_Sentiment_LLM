Spark!Lab is an experiential learning and activity space \\u2013 developed by the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center \\u2013 that provides children and young people with opportunities to invent, design, collaborate, and find solutions to real-world problems, equipping them with STEM skills that can ultimately help them build careers in creative industries. Together with ConocoPhillips Qatar, QF and the Lemelson Center created a pop-up Spark!Lab at Education City during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021\\u2122, where young participants worked together on innovations themed around accessibility and sport. Spark!Lab will be back at QF at the end of the year, before and during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\\u2122, after which the partnership seeks to build a permanent Spark!Lab within Education City Stadium post-tournament. The partnership will also make invention education learning materials globally available in the Arabic language. \\u201cWelcoming Spark!Lab to Education City, which has been made possible through our long-term strategic partnership with the Smithsonian Institution and ConocoPhillips Qatar\\u2019s support, reflects QF\\u2019s commitment to providing our youth with new and engaging opportunities to explore, discover, grow, and become lifelong learners,\\u201d said Machaille Hassan Al-Naimi, President of Community Development, Qatar Foundation. \\u201cWe believe in both the importance of accessibility and inclusivity, and the power of sport, in building strong, healthy, vibrant communities, and it has been wonderful to see children and young people produce amazing, inventive solutions to real-life challenges based on these themes at the pop-up Spark!Lab. \\u201cTo see them embracing the invention education opportunities that Spark!Lab offers makes us really excited for its return in 2022, the opportunities that it will offer youth in Qatar beyond the World Cup, and the invention education resources in the Arabic language that will be made possible through this partnership. We look forward to seeing our work with the Smithsonian Institution continuing to go from strength to strength, as together we open up new pathways for youth to realize their potential.\\u201d Arthur Daemmrich, Director of the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, said: \\u201cIt has been inspiring to see young people in Qatar embrace inventive identities. \\u201cTheir willingness to tackle challenges that use both familiar and novel materials and to create physical prototypes while practicing 21st Century skills of risk-taking, perseverance, and creative problem solving bodes well for the future of Qatar and the world. \\u201cWe have been fortunate to have such engaged collaborators in Qatar Foundation and ConocoPhillips Qatar, which has made it possible to carry out our most successful international Spark!Lab to date. Continuing to develop new activities that relate to innovations in Qatar while benefitting the world is an exciting next step for us.\\u201d \\u201cOur future relies on the next generation of inventors, as our communities and industries will need their ideas to solve challenges and power our economies. Spark!Lab plays an invaluable role inspiring children to become leaders in STEM fields, encouraging them to foster lifelong passions for science and engineering,\\u201d said Todd Creeger, President of ConocoPhillips Qatar. \\u201cWe are proud to partner with the Smithsonian Institution and Qatar Foundation, two leading entities in the fields of education and scientific research, to bring this unique initiative to Qatar. This offers a glimpse of the potential for multi-disciplinary collaborations between industry and public organizations to bring a positive impact to society.\\u201d QF\\u2019s collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution \\u2013 the US\\u2019 leading education, cultural, and research institution \\u2013 was formed in 2020 at the third U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue in Washington D.C., and focuses on education, science, and conservation and heritage preservation.

The stock is a Shell Centre, 2 York Road, London, Greater London, SE1\\nconstituent of FTSE 100 Index. As of February 12, 2021, The Capital Group is effectively the largest 7NA\\nshareholder with a 5% stake in the firm.\\nTelephone\\nDIVISIONAL OVERVIEW: Shell has five reporting segments \\u2013 Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products,\\n44 80 0731 8888\\nChemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas (45% of 2021 normalized earnings) business focuses on liquefying\\nnatural gas (LNG) for transportation to customers around the world.

At the same time, it will continue divesting non-strategic assets at an annual average of around\\nUnited Kingdom Ernst & Young LLP\\nUSD4 billion to high-grade its portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders will still be rewarded by progressive\\ndividend growth of around 4% each year, as well as additional cash return via share buybacks that will bring Founded\\ntotal shareholders distributions to around 20-30% of cash flow from operations. 1907\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: Shell\\u2019s financial performance recovered in 2021 with adjusted earnings nearly\\nEmployees\\nquadrupled Y/Y to USD19.3 billion, leading to a sharp rebound in return on average capital employed to 8.5%\\n82,000\\nfrom 2.9% in prior year.

Together with ConocoPhillips Qatar, QF and the Lemelson Center created a pop-up Spark!Lab at Education City during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021\\u2122, where young participants worked together on innovations themed around accessibility and sport. Spark!Lab will be back at QF at the end of the year, before and during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\\u2122, after which the partnership seeks to build a permanent Spark!Lab within Education City Stadium post-tournament.
