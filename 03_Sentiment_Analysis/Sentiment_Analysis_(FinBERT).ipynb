Now this [the energy shortage - TASS] should be offset by imports. Before the start of 2022, it [natural gas - TASS] was largely flowing through pipelines from Russia; now it comes more and more often from Norway and on LPG carriers from all over the world,\\\" Opedal noted. \\\"This means prices will fluctuate.

Headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, Valero Energy Corporation is the world\\u2019s Investor contact\\nlargest independent petroleum refiner and marketer, supplying fuel and products from the U.S. West and H. Bhullar (210 345 2000)\\nGulf coasts to Canada and the U.K. Its refineries produce conventional gasolines, distillates, jet fuel, asphalt,\\npetrochemicals, lubricants, and other refined products. As of year-end 2022, the company owned and Office\\noperated 15 refineries with a combined throughput capacity of 3.15 million barrels per day (b/d). These One Valero Way, San Antonio, Texas, 78249\\ncapacities by region include: Gulf Coast (eight refineries, 65% of 2022 throughput capacity), the Mid-\\nContinent (two, 9%), the North Atlantic (two, 16%), and West Coast (two, 10%). Telephone\\n210 345 2000\\nMARKET PROFILE. In 2022, the company operated three business segments: refining (pre-tax operating\\nincome of about 16 billion in 2022 versus about $1.9 billion in 2021), ethanol ($110 million, $473 million), Fax\\nand its newest segment, renewable diesel ($774 million, $709 million). Renewable Diesel includes the N/A\\nresults from Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD), a consolidated joint venture. Also, effective 2019,\\noperations from the former VLP segment (which focused on logistics) were moved to the Refining segment. Website\\nThe assets in VLP are now treated as logistics assets that support the operation of the refining segment. www.valero.com\\nThe ethanol segment includes sales of internally produced ethanol and distillers grains. VLO sells its ethanol\\nprimarily to refiners and gasoline blenders under term and spot contracts in bulk markets such as New York, Officers\\nChicago, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Florida, and the U.S. West Coast.

D. Mullins R. A. Profusek\\nnew rules for ocean-going vessels that reduce sulfur emissions by weight to 0.5% from prior 3.5% and took\\neffect on January 1, 2020. The transition is underway, and while consumers of marine fuels do have options F. M. Diaz R. J. Weisenburger\\n(such as installing scrubbers on their vessels), we expect that the majority of the firms that own marine H. P. Eberhart R. L.

We believe that this transition will ultimately benefit complex refineries\\n(such as those owned by VLO), given their ability to extract more value from low-priced heavy sour oil.\\nThe Renewable Fuel Standards biofuels blending requirements call for refiners to blend a certain amount of Domicile Auditor\\nbiofuels, such as ethanol, into gasoline production or purchase renewable fuel credits or renewable Delaware KPMG LLP - Klynveld Peat\\nidentification numbers (RINs). VLO said in February 2021 that its biofuel blending costs were $648 million in Marwick Goerdeler\\nFounded\\n2020, up from $318 million in 2019.\\n1980\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Total capital spending totaled $2.7 billion in 2022, a slight uptick from $2.5 billion in\\n2021. For 2023, VLO guided to $2 billion for capital spending, with $1.5 billion of its capital spending being Employees\\nallocated to sustaining projects and $500 million in growth projects, essentially the same plan as that for 9,886\\n2021. We estimate VLO with free cash flow in the range of $8.7 billion in 2023, down from $9.8 billion in\\nStockholders\\n2022, and $5.9 billion in 2024. In the first quarter of 2023, VLO raised its quarterly based dividend by 4% to a\\n4,414\\nrevised $1.02 per share ($4.08 per share annualized), and we estimate dividends will likely chew up around\\n20% of VLO\\u2019s free cash flow in 2024.\\nThe Brent-WTI spread was about $5.00 per barrel as of the middle of December 2023, but based on\\nforecasts of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, we think the spread should average around $5.00\\nper barrel in 2023 and 2024. Narrower spreads typically hurt refining margins, but for context, the spread\\naveraged $6.75/barrel in 2018-2019 before falling to $2.50/barrel in 2020.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

Devon Energy Corp. (DVN) is an independent exploration and production company Investor contact\\nprimarily engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas; the acquisition of S. Coody (405 235 3611)\\nproducing properties; the transportation of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs); and the\\nprocessing of natural gas. Through a series of acquisitions and divestitures, DVN, as of early 2020, was Office\\nfocused on a combination of growth assets in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the STACK 333 West Sheridan Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma,\\nplay in Oklahoma, and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Excluding the 2019 asset sales of its former 73102-5015\\nCanadian assets and its Barnett Shale acreage (both of which previously provided cash flow to support\\ngrowth spending elsewhere), proved oil and gas reserves were down 8% at year-end 2019, to 757 MMBOE Telephone\\n(64% liquids, 78% developed). Based on 2019 production, we estimate a reserve life of about 6.3 years, 405 235 3611\\nbelow the peer average. DVN's relatively low proved undeveloped reserves exposure (PUD; 22%) is an\\nFax\\nadvantage, in our view, since PUD reserves typically require higher levels of spending to transform into\\nN/A\\nproduction.\\nDVN also, in 2017, controlled a publicly-traded midstream entity, Enlink Midstream Partners LP, but sold its Website\\nstake in this entity in July 2018. ENLK is focused primarily on connecting natural gas wells to gathering www.devonenergy.com\\nsystems, the processing and fractionation of NGLs into individual component parts, and transportation of\\nthe dry natural gas to end markets. DVN saw ENLK as a provider of relatively stable cash flows via long-term, Officers\\nfee-based contracts, where volumes matter more than the price of the commodity. President, CEO & Director Executive VP & General\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY. Like many E&Ps in 2010, DVN shifted its strategy to increase its exposure to crude R. E. Muncrief Counse\\noil or NGL production, given the higher margins in liquids versus natural gas. In March 2014, DVN completed D. C. Cameron\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nthe $6.0 billion acquisition of the Eagle Ford assets of Geosouthern Energy, which has assets in the Eagle\\nJ. L. Ritenour Vice President of\\nFord Shale in Texas, which we think will further boost DVN's liquids exposure. Based on data from S&P\\nTechnology\\nCapital IQ, DVN is expected to grow its liquids profile to 72% in 2021 from 69% in 2019, slightly above peers.\\nSenior VP & Chief T. Lowe\\nThis is also a marked change from the end of 2014, when its liquids exposure (crude oil and NGLs) was a\\nAccounting Officer\\nmere 55%. S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates for 2020 capital spending stand at $1.8 billion as of\\nJ. D. Humphers Executive Chairman of the\\nFebruary 2020, down from $1.9 billion spent in 2019. Capital spending has been on the decline in recent\\nBoard\\nyears, as non-core assets get sloughed off. We viewed 2017 as a transition year for DVN, as it continued the Executive VP & COO D. A. Hager\\neffort to divest non-core assets and get a stronger understanding of its potential growth targets. Although C. M. Gaspar\\nnear-term production growth appears meager, we see it as a consequence of shifting to a lower-risk, high-\\nreturn portfolio than in the past. As of March 2020, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates indicate that 2020\\nBoard Members\\nproduction growth should be roughly mid-single-digit, with 9% growth in crude oil volumes offset by a 2%\\nA. G. Fox J. L. Nichols\\ndecline in natural gas liquids volumes, and a 3% rise in gas volumes.\\nB. M. Baumann K. F. Kurz\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. In 2019, DVN generated 327,000 boe/d of production, led by its\\nDelaware Basin assets (127,000 boe/d), along with its STACK play assets (119,000 boe/d) and its Eagle Ford D. A. Hager K. Kindick\\nShale acreage (47,000 boe/d). In early 2018, DVN sold the southern portion of its Barnett assets for $553 D. C. Radtke R. A. Mosbacher\\nmillion in cash, and in December 2019, announced the sale of its remaining Barnett assets. Also in 2019,\\nD. M. Phillips R. E. Muncrief\\nDVN sold its Western Canadian assets for $2.6 billion USD, completing DVN\\u2019s retrenchment as a largely U.S.\\nonshore play. J. E. Bethancourt V. M. Williams\\nIn November 2013, DVN agreed to acquire the Eagle Ford Shale assets of Geosouthern Energy for $6.0 billion J. Krenicki\\nin cash. The deal, which was completed in March 2014, added 53,000 boe/d of production, largely liquids,\\nand also added 400 MMBOE of risked recoverable resource, most of which is proved reserves, according to\\nDomicile Auditor\\nDVN.\\nDelaware KPMG LLP - Klynveld Peat\\nIn October 2013, DVN and Crosstex Energy, Inc. announced agreements to combine all of DVN's U.S. Marwick Goerdeler\\nmidstream assets with Crosstex's assets to form a new midstream business consisting of two publicly Founded\\ntraded entities: the master limited partnership and a general partner entity. It is expected to have adjusted 1971\\nEBITDA of $700 million in 2014 and to be immediately accretive to DVN. DVN will contribute $100 million in\\nEmployees\\ncash; the assets are valued at $4.8 billion. DVN had planned to file registration for a midstream spin-off, but\\n1,800\\nthis deal will add more scale and enhance growth. The deal closed in March 2014.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. We estimate return on invested capital in 2020 of 3.5%, slightly above the 2.7% peer Stockholders\\nmedian. In early 2018, DVN announced plans to repurchase up to $1.0 billion in its common stock, as well as 6,771\\na plan to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its debt securities. Its long-term debt at year-end 2019 stood at\\n$4.3 billion, down dramatically from $10.3 billion at year end 2017, and we think it is headed in the right\\ndirection.\\nThe pending sale of DVN\\u2019s Barnett Shale assets on October 1, 2020 for up to $830 million (cash proceeds of\\n$570 million and contingent payments of up to $260 million) should help buttress DVN\\u2019s war chest, which\\nnow stands at $1.5 billion cash on hand at June 30, 2020. We estimate that DVN\\u2019s net debt relative to\\nforward EBITDA (excluding WPX) stands at about 1.95x, but the company has plans to reduce that metric to\\n1.0x in a mid-cycle environment. Barring a major step back in crude oil prices, we think DVN has the means\\nto achieve this goal in 2021.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.
