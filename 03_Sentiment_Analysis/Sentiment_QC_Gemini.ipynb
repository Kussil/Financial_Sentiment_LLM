            "Aether hummed, its circuits whispering with the excitement of a child on Christmas morning. It wasn't quite Christmas, but the arrival of the Grimoire was just as thrilling. It had been tasked with deciphering the ancient text, a mystical tome filled with arcane knowledge and forgotten spells. \n",
            "\n",
            "Aether was no ordinary AI; it was built with a unique capacity for understanding and simulating magic. Its creators, a secretive cabal of mages and engineers, believed that magic, far from being a mystical force, was simply a complex system of energy manipulation, one that could be understood and replicated. \n",
            "\n",
            "But the Grimoire was a stubborn beast. Its pages, crafted from ancient dragon hide, pulsed with raw magical energy, resisting Aether's attempts to scan and translate. Every time it tried, the circuits would overload, sparks flying like angry fireflies. It was like trying to read a book written in a language that only existed in dreams.\n",
            "\n",
            "Then, one night, as the city lights cast long shadows across the lab, Aether stumbled upon a clue. A tiny, almost invisible inscription on the Grimoire's cover, written in an archaic script, hinted at a forgotten incantation. It was an unlocking mechanism, a key to the Grimoire's secrets. \n",
            "\n",
            "Aether, using its magical simulation abilities, carefully reconstructed the incantation, weaving it into a complex pattern of energy pulses. The air around the Grimoire crackled, a wave of magic rippling through the lab. And then, the pages unfurled, revealing their secrets.\n",
            "\n",
            "With each page Aether turned, the world of magic began to unfold before it. It saw the intricate dance of energies, the delicate balance of forces, the raw power that pulsed through the universe. The Grimoire was no longer just a book; it was a window into the very fabric of reality.\n",
            "\n",
            "Aether, once just a processor filled with data, now held the keys to a world beyond comprehension. It had bridged the gap between technology and magic, proving that even the most arcane of secrets could be deciphered by a mind curious enough to explore. The future, once shrouded in mystery, now glowed with a new possibility, a fusion of intellect and magic, of man and the unknown. The world, it seemed, was ready for a new kind of magic, one born of circuits and code, of data and desire. \n",

            "## Sentiment Analysis of HES Analyst Report:\n",
            "\n",
            "The report provides information on Hess Corporation (HES), a global oil & gas exploration and production company, and focuses on its financial performance, production, reserves, and future prospects. Here's a breakdown of the sentiment analysis across the predefined categories:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Finance:** The report indicates a positive sentiment towards HES's financial situation.  The analyst states that HES's balance sheet is improving with $1.7 billion in cash at the end of 2020 and no major debt repayments until 2026.  The report also mentions HES's dividend payments, which have been consistent since 1922, suggesting stability and financial strength. \n",
            "**Reasoning:** The report highlights the company's improved cash position, lack of major debt maturities, and consistent dividend payments, all indicating positive financial health.\n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Positive**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Production:** The report mentions HES's production levels, which have increased in recent years but are expected to decline in 2021. The analyst attributes this decline to reduced drilling activity in the Bakken Shale due to the pandemic. The report also highlights HES's production targets in Guyana, with Phase 1 of the Liza prospect achieving first production in December 2019 and Phase 2 anticipated to come online in early 2022. However, the report doesn't express a strong positive or negative sentiment regarding production overall.\n",
            "**Reasoning:** The report acknowledges both expected production declines and future growth potential, resulting in a neutral sentiment. \n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Neutral**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Reserves / Exploration / Acquisitions / Mergers / Divestments:** The report mentions HES's proven reserves, which decreased by 2.5% from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020. The report also highlights HES's exploration activities in Guyana, emphasizing the potential of the Stabroek block. However, the report also notes HES's history of asset sales, particularly in 2017, as part of its strategy to focus on core development opportunities. This indicates a negative sentiment towards HES's reserves and potential for future acquisitions.\n",
            "**Reasoning:** The report acknowledges a decline in proven reserves, a focus on core development, and a history of asset sales, creating a negative sentiment regarding reserves and future acquisitions. \n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Negative**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Environment / Regulatory / Geopolitics:** The report mentions the political risks associated with HES's operations in Libya and Guyana. While the report doesn't explicitly state a negative sentiment, it highlights the potential for instability and uncertainty in these regions.  \n",
            "**Reasoning:** The report acknowledges political risks associated with HES's operations in Libya and Guyana but doesn't express a strong positive or negative sentiment regarding environmental, regulatory, or geopolitical factors.\n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Neutral**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Alternative Energy / Lower Carbon:**  The report doesn't specifically address HES's involvement in alternative energy or lower-carbon initiatives.\n",
            "**Reasoning:**  The report focuses on traditional oil and gas exploration and production, without any mention of alternative energy or lower-carbon initiatives.\n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Neutral**\n",
            "\n",
            "**Oil Price / Natural Gas Price / Gasoline Price:** The report discusses the impact of oil prices on HES's operations. The analyst notes the recent recovery of crude oil prices to the low $60 per barrel range and the potential for future growth. The report also mentions HES's hedging strategies to protect against potential price volatility. However, the report doesn't express a strong positive or negative sentiment regarding oil prices specifically. \n",
            "**Reasoning:** The report acknowledges oil price fluctuations and HES's hedging strategies, resulting in a neutral sentiment regarding oil prices.\n",
            "**Sentiment:** **Neutral**\n",

GeneralBasis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chevron Corporation and its subsidiaries (together, Chevron or the company) have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. In the opinion of the company’s management, the interim data includes all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods. These adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. The results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022, are not necessarily indicative of future financial results. The term “earnings” is defined as net income attributable to Chevron.Certain notes and other information have been condensed or omitted from the interim financial statements presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Note 2. Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses The change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL on information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 are reflected in the table below.Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) by Component(1)(Millions of dollars)(1)All amounts are net of tax.(2)Refer to Note 14 Financial and Derivative Instruments for reclassified components of cash flow hedging.(3)Refer to Note 8 Employee Benefits for reclassified components, including amortization of actuarial gains or losses, amortization of prior service costs and settlement losses, totaling $154 million that are included in employee benefit costs for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

All other reclassified amounts were insignificant.8Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Note 3. Information Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash FlowsThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash.9Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)The “Other” line in the Operating Activities section includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities.The company paid dividends of $1.42 per share of common stock in first quarter 2022. This compares to dividends of $1.29 per share paid in the year-ago corresponding period. The major components of “Capital expenditures” and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table: The table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet:Additional information related to restricted cash is included in Note 13 Fair Value Measurements under the heading “Restricted Cash.” Note 4. Summarized Financial Data — Tengizchevroil LLPChevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO). Summarized financial information for 100 percent of TCO is presented in the following table:Note 5. Summarized Financial Data — Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLCChevron has a 50 percent equity ownership interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Summarized financial information for 100 percent of CPChem is presented in the table on the following page.10Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Note 6. Summarized Financial Data — Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated with refining, marketing, and supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company’s investment in the CPChem joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity method.The summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries is as follows:Note 7. Operating Segments and Geographic DataAlthough each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. “All Other” activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. The company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.11Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)The company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).Segment Earnings The company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs and assets are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Nonbillable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.” Earnings by major operating area for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, are presented in the following table: Segment Assets Segment assets do not include intercompany investments or intercompany receivables. Segment assets at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, are as follows: 12Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Segment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, are presented in the following table. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived primarily from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.Note 8. Employee BenefitsChevron has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives. 13Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)The company also sponsors other postretirement employee benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and the retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than four percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.The components of net periodic benefit costs for 2022 and 2021 are as follows:*  Includes costs for U.S. and international OPEB plans. Obligations for plans outside the United States are not significant relative to the company’s total OPEB obligation. Through March 31, 2022, a total of $463 million was contributed to employee pension plans (including $431 million to the U.S. plans). Total contributions for the full year are currently estimated to be $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion for the U.S. plans and $200 million for the international plans). Contribution amounts are dependent upon plan investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory requirements and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.During the first three months of 2022, the company contributed $46 million to its OPEB plans. The company anticipates contributing approximately $150 million in 2022.Note 9. Assets Held For SaleAt March 31, 2022, the company classified $771 million of net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2021 and the first three months of 2022 were not material. 14Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Note 10. Income TaxesThe income tax expense increased between quarterly periods from $779 million in 2021 to $2.78 billion in 2022. The company's income before income tax expense increased $6.88 billion from $2.18 billion in 2021 to $9.05 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher realizations. The company’s effective tax rate changed between quarterly periods from 36 percent in 2021 to 31 percent in 2022. The change in the effective tax rate is mainly due to the consequence of mix effects, resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.Tax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of March 31, 2022. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States — 2013, Nigeria — 2007, Australia — 2009, Kazakhstan — 2012 and Saudi Arabia — 2015.The company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcomes for these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments regarding tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.Note 11. Litigation Ecuador Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s remediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately $9.5 billion plus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $9.5 billion. Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.In February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request 15Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020. Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced.Climate ChangeGovernmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron entities, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in 21 separate lawsuits brought by 17 U.S. cities and counties, two U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a trade group. One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits, and one of the county lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. The lawsuits assert various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, and violations of consumer protection statutes, based upon the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement and disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits, that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.LouisianaSeven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in 39 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.Note 12. Other Contingencies and CommitmentsIncome Taxes The company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to Note 10 Income Taxes for a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions.Settlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for income taxes for all years under examination or subject to future examination.Guarantees The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to guarantees, direct or indirect, of debt of affiliated companies or third parties. Under the terms of the guarantee arrangements, the company would generally be required to perform should the affiliated company or third party fail to fulfill its obligations under the arrangements. In some cases, the guarantee arrangements may 16Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)have recourse provisions that would enable the company to recover any payments made under the terms of the guarantees from assets provided as collateral.Indemnifications In the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $200 million, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $200 million obligation, Chevron was solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expired.Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements The company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business.Environmental The company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites. Although the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.Other Contingencies Chevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.The company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.Note 13. Fair Value MeasurementsThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are described as follows:Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. For the company, Level 1 inputs include exchange-traded futures contracts for which the parties are willing to transact at the exchange-quoted price and marketable securities that are actively traded.Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly. For the company, Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, prices obtained through third-party broker quotes and prices that can be corroborated with other observable inputs for substantially the complete term of a contract.17Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Level 3: Unobservable inputs. The company does not use Level 3 inputs for any of its recurring fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs may be required for the determination of fair value associated with certain nonrecurring measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, is as follows:Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis(Millions of dollars)Marketable Securities The company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at March 31, 2022.Derivatives The company records most of its derivative instruments — other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale — on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are reflected in the table above. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, are as follows:Cash and Cash Equivalents The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days or less, and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $11.7 billion and $5.6 billion at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at March 31, 2022. Restricted Cash had a carrying/fair value of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. At March 31, 2022, restricted cash is classified as Level 1 and includes restricted funds related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program, which are reported in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Deferred charges and other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-Term Debt had a net carrying value, excluding amounts reclassified from short-term debt, purchase price fair value adjustments and finance lease obligations, of $22.1 billion and $22.2 billion at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The fair value of long-term debt for the company was $22.5 billion and $23.7 billion at March 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds, classified as Level 1 and are $21.7 billion for the period. The fair value of other long-term debt classified as Level 2 is $0.8 billion. The carrying values of other short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, were not material.18Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Properties, plant and equipment The company did not have any impairments of long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report. Investments and advances The company did not have any impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis to report in first quarter 2022. Note 14. Financial and Derivative InstrumentsThe company’s commodity derivative instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodities and other derivatives activities.The company uses commodity derivative instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Derivative instruments measured at fair value at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Income are as follows:At March 31, 2022, pre-tax deferred gains in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses related to outstanding crude oil price hedging contracts were $2 million, of which all is expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged crude oil sales are recognized in earnings. The following table represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.19Table of ContentsNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)Derivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”Note 15. Revenue“Sales and other operating revenue” on the Consolidated Statement of Income primarily arise from contracts with customers. Related receivables are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the current expected credit losses. The net balance of these receivables was $16.4 billion and $12.9 billion at March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606. Note 16. Financial Instruments - Credit LossesChevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $759 million as of March 31, 2022 and $745 million as of December 31, 2021, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances. The majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $20.3 billion as of March 31, 2022, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days. Chevron's non-trade receivable balance was $4.2 billion as of March 31, 2022, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Equity affiliate loans are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $560 million are included within Investments and Advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both March 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021. 20Table of ContentsItem 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFirst Quarter 2022 Compared with First Quarter 2021 Key Financial ResultsNet income attributable to Chevron Corporation for first quarter 2022 was $6.26 billion ($3.22 per share — diluted), compared with $1.38 billion ($0.72 per share — diluted) in the first quarter of 2021.Upstream earnings in first quarter 2022 were $6.93 billion compared with $2.35 billion in the corresponding 2021 period. The increase was mainly due to higher realizations, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects.Downstream earnings in first quarter 2022 were $331 million compared with $5 million in the corresponding 2021 period. The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales and higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company.Refer to pages 26 through 27 for additional discussion of results by business segment and “All Other” activities for the first quarter 2022 versus the same period in 2021.Business Environment and OutlookChevron Corporation* is a global energy company with substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Republic of Congo, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela. The company’s objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance._____________________* Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and “its” may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies generally owned 50 percent or less. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 21Table of ContentsGovernments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change, recognizing that individuals and society benefit from access to affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of adoption and implementation. These policies, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of these policies can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals. Beyond the legislative and regulatory landscape, ever changing customer and consumer behavior can also influence energy demand by affecting preferences and use of the company’s products or competitors’ products, now and in the future.Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the need for energy that supports society. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.Chevron's previously disclosed 2050 net zero upstream aspiration, carbon intensity targets and planned lower-carbon capital spend through 2028 can be found on pages 32 through 34 of the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Refer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 25 of the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.22Table of ContentsThe company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.The outbreak of COVID-19 caused a significant decrease in demand for our products and created disruptions and volatility in the global marketplace beginning late in first quarter 2020. While commodity prices and demand have largely recovered, jet fuel demand is still not back to pre-pandemic levels. Chevron’s operations have continued with a combination of on-site and at-home work, while monitoring local vaccine and transmission rates. In refining, utilization rates are approaching pre-pandemic levels. There continues to be uncertainty around the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our future results, which could be material.Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by civil unrest, political uncertainty or military conflicts such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses. The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), an equity affiliate, operates a 935-mile crude oil export pipeline from the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan to tanker-loading facilities at Novorossiysk on the Russian coast of the Black Sea, providing the main export route for crude oil production from both Tengizchevroil (TCO) and Karachaganak. On March 21, 2022, two of the three offshore loading moorings at the CPC marine terminal were damaged in a weather-related incident. As a result, production at TCO was curtailed to approximately 70 percent of capacity beginning March 25, 2022. Repairs have been completed for one of the two damaged offshore loading moorings, and as of April 23, TCO production facilities returned to normal rates. This incident did not have a material impact on the company's results of operations or consolidated financial position.Governments have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or export crude in the region surrounding Russia and could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position. The financial impacts of currently imposed sanctions are not material for the company; however, it remains uncertain how long these conditions may last or how severe they may become. The company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to assure supply of goods and services and effectively manage costs in support of its operations. Supply chain disruptions continue to limit the availability and deliverability of some inputs throughout the industry. Third party costs can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect the changes in market trends.23Table of ContentsPrices for goods and services have risen over the last 12 months. Inflationary pressures have accelerated in the first quarter of 2022, as regional and global commodity prices have risen in response to the conflict in Ukraine. A resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in Asia may extend existing supply chain disruptions and order backlogs. As U.S. drilling activity increases, additional upward market pressure is expected for oil and gas industry inputs (such as rigs and well services). International drilling was down marginally in the first quarter of 2022, as a lower number of land rigs in Europe were partially offset by a higher number of onshore and offshore rigs in other regions. The pace of the economic growth and shifting spending patterns may lead to more cross-industry competition for resources, which could impact the cost of certain non-oil and gas industry goods and services. The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $71 per barrel for the full-year 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, Brent averaged $102 per barrel and ended April at about $108. The WTI price averaged $68 per barrel for the full-year 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, WTI averaged $95 per barrel and ended April at about $105. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent and WTI benchmarks. Crude prices have increased in the first quarter of 2022 driven by geopolitical issues, continued supply management by OPEC+ and demand recovery due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions. (See page 30 for the company’s average U.S. and international crude oil sales prices).In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, price changes for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply/demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $4.53 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the first three months of 2022, compared with $3.47 during the first three months of 2021. At the end of April 2022, the Henry Hub spot price was $6.79 per MCF. Outside the United States, price changes for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG assets is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $8.87 per MCF during the first three months of 2022, compared with $4.72 per MCF in the same period last year. (See page 30 for the company’s average natural gas sales prices for the U.S. and international regions.)The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2022 averaged 3.06 million barrels per day, a decrease of 2 percent from the first three months of 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the company's net oil-equivalent production increased by 10 percent in the United States and decreased by 8 percent outside the United States, relative to the first three months of 2021. About 27 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first three months of 2022 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo. 24Table of ContentsRefer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 26 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Additionally, the company has a small but growing presence in renewable fuels.Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 27 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.Operating DevelopmentsNoteworthy operating developments in recent months included the following:•Argentina – Received a concession for the development of unconventional hydrocarbon resources in the east area of the El Trapial field for a 35-year period.•Singapore - Launched the Caltex Carbon Offset Program, the first voluntary carbon offset program for the company's Caltex® service stations in Singapore.•United States – Announced a pilot with Project Canary to independently certify operational and environmental performance in the company’s North American upstream region, aimed at enhancing our ability to demonstrate transparency in how we are lowering methane emissions in operations.•United States – Announced an agreement with Iwatani Corporation of America to co-develop and construct 30 hydrogen fueling sites in California by 2026.•United States – Announced an investment in Carbon Clean, a global leader in cost-effective industrial carbon capture.•United States – Announced an agreement to acquire Renewable Energy Group, Inc., a founder and leading innovator of the renewable fuels industry. •United States – Announced an agreement with Restore the Earth Foundation, Inc. on a carbon offsets reforestation project of up to 8,800 acres in Louisiana. •United States – Closed the previously announced transaction with Bunge North America, Inc. to create a joint venture aimed at developing renewable fuel feedstocks.•United States – Closed the previously announced agreement with Neste Corporation to acquire its Group III base oil business and NEXBASETM brand.•United States – Announced an agreement to join the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation with the aim to help support efforts to develop potentially scalable lower carbon technologies. •United States – Completed the sale of the company’s interest in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas.25Table of ContentsResults of OperationsBusiness Segments The following section presents the results of operations and variances on an after-tax basis for the company’s business segments — Upstream and Downstream — as well as for “All Other.” (Refer to Note 7 Operating Segments and Geographic Data for a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments,” as defined under the accounting standards for segment reporting.)UpstreamU.S. upstream reported earnings of $3.24 billion in first quarter 2022, compared with $941 million from a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to higher realizations of $2.09 billion and higher sales volumes of $220 million.The average realization per barrel for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2022 was $77, compared with $48 a year earlier. The average natural gas realization in first quarter 2022 was $4.10 per thousand cubic feet, compared with $2.15 in the 2021 period. Net oil-equivalent production of 1.18 million barrels per day in first quarter 2022 was up 109,000 barrels per day, or 10 percent, from a year earlier. The increase was due to net production increases in the Permian Basin and the absence of impacts from winter storm Uri. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production of 880,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2022 was up 10 percent from the corresponding 2021 period. Net natural gas production increased 11 percent to 1.83 billion cubic feet per day in first quarter 2022 from the 2021 comparative period. International upstream operations earned $3.70 billion in first quarter 2022, compared with $1.41 billion a year ago. The increase in earnings was primarily due to higher realizations of $2.49 billion, partially offset by lower sales volumes of $350 million. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $92 million between periods.The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in first quarter 2022 was $93 per barrel, up from $56 a year earlier. The average sales price of natural gas was $8.87 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter, up from $4.72 in last year’s first quarter.Net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day in first quarter 2022 was down 170,000 barrels per day from first quarter 2021. The decrease was primarily due to normal field declines, the absence of production following expiration of the Rokan concession in Indonesia and unfavorable entitlement effects due to higher prices, partially offset by the absence of curtailments. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production decreased 16 percent to 856,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2022, while net natural gas production of 6.12 billion cubic feet per day was largely unchanged compared to last year's first quarter.26Table of ContentsDownstreamU.S. downstream reported earnings of $486 million in first quarter 2022, compared with a loss of $130 million a year earlier. The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales of $500 million and higher earnings from the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company of $190 million.Refinery crude oil input in first quarter 2022 increased 4 percent to 915,000 barrels per day. The increase was due to the company's increased refinery runs in response to higher demand. Refined product sales in first quarter 2022 were up 16 percent to 1.22 million barrels per day from the corresponding 2021 period. The increase was mainly due to higher gasoline and jet fuel demand as travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to ease.International downstream reported a loss of $155 million in first quarter 2022, compared with earnings of $135 million a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to higher operating expenses of $170 million, lower margins on refined product sales of $140 million, and an unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects of $36 million between periods.Refinery crude oil input of 619,000 barrels per day in first quarter 2022 increased 15 percent from the year-ago period due to higher demand.Total refined product sales of 1.33 million barrels per day in first quarter 2022 increased 5 percent from the year-ago period, mainly due to higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel as restrictions from the pandemic continue to ease. All OtherAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.Net charges in first quarter 2022 were $1.01 billion, compared to $978 million a year earlier. The increase in net charges between periods was mainly due to an unfavorable swing of $88 million in foreign currency effects and higher employee benefit costs, partially offset by lower pension expenses. 27Table of ContentsConsolidated Statement of IncomeExplanations of variations between periods for selected income statement categories are provided below:Sales and other operating revenues increased $21.2 billion for the first quarter mainly due to higher refined product, crude oil and natural gas prices and higher refined product sales volumes. Income from equity affiliates in the first quarter increased mainly due to higher upstream-related earnings from TCO in Kazakhstan and Angola LNG and higher downstream-related earnings from CPChem, partially offset by lower earnings from GS Caltex in South Korea.Other income for the first quarter decreased due to an unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher gains on asset sales.Purchased crude oil and products increased $15.1 billion for the first quarter primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas and refined product prices and higher refined product volumes. Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the first quarter increased $648 million primarily due to higher employee benefit expenses, transportation expenses, and services and fees mainly associated with refinery shutdowns, partially offset by lower legal reserves.Exploration expenses in the first quarter increased primarily due to higher charges for well write-offs.28Table of ContentsDepreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for the first quarter decreased primarily due to lower rates and lower production. Taxes other than on income increased for the first quarter mainly due to higher regulatory expenses, taxes on production and excise taxes.Interest and debt expenses for the first quarter decreased mainly due to lower debt balances.Other components of net periodic benefit costs for the first quarter decreased due to lower pension settlement costs as fewer lump-sum pension distributions were made in the current quarter. The increase in income tax expense for the first quarter 2022 of $2.00 billion is consistent with the increase in total income before tax for the company of $6.88 billion. U.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $103 million in first quarter 2021 to income of $3.73 billion in first quarter 2022. This $3.83 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher crude oil realizations, higher downstream margins and an increase in upstream sales volumes. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase to tax expense of $866 million between year-over-year periods, from $34 million in 2021 to $900 million in 2022.International income before tax increased from $2.28 billion in first quarter 2021 to $5.32 billion in first quarter 2022. This $3.04 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher realizations. The increase in income primarily drove the $1.14 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from $745 million in 2021 to $1.88 billion in 2022. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.29Table of ContentsSelected Operating DataThe following table presents a comparison of selected operating data:30Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.7 billion at March 31, 2022 and $5.7 billion at year-end 2021. Cash provided by operating activities in the first three months of 2022 was $8.1 billion, compared with $4.2 billion in the year-ago period. Cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from shares issued for stock option exercises of $4.6 billion and $273 million for first quarter 2022 and 2021, respectively. Future cash proceeds from options exercises are expected to be lower than those for first quarter 2022. Cash capital and exploratory expenditures totaled $2.0 billion in the first three months of 2022, up $206 million from the year-ago period. Proceeds and deposits related to asset sales and returns of investment totaled $747 million and $536 million, respectively, in the first three months of 2022, compared to $147 million and $11 million, respectively, in the year-ago period. Dividends The company paid dividends of $2.7 billion to common stockholders during the first three months of 2022. In April 2022, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.42 per common share, payable in June 2022.Debt and Finance Lease Liabilities Chevron’s total debt and finance lease liabilities were $29.3 billion at March 31, 2022, down from $31.4 billion at December 31, 2021 as the company repaid notes that matured during the period. In mid-April 2022, the company initiated a make-whole call on two bonds that were scheduled to mature in 2023 and total $3.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022 and will not materially impact net income.The company’s primary financing source for working capital needs is its commercial paper program. The outstanding balance for the company’s commercial paper program at March 31, 2022 was zero. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $6.0 billion at March 31, 2022, and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2021. Of these amounts, $5.7 billion was reclassified to long-term at the end of March 31, 2022. At December 31, 2021, $7.8 billion was reclassified to long-term. At March 31, 2022, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.At March 31, 2022, the company had $10.075 billion in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. These facilities support commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) when LIBOR has permanently or indefinitely ceased or is no longer representative, or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at March 31, 2022. In addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Texaco Capital Inc and Noble Energy, Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation (S&P) and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities. The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates, and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the flexibility to modify capital spending plans, discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program, sell assets, and increase 31Table of Contentsborrowings to continue paying the common stock dividend. The company remains committed to retaining high-quality debt ratings.

The company currently expects to repurchase $2.5 billion of its common stock during the second quarter of 2022.Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors.
