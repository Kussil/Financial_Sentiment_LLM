The report also mentions DVN's ability to maintain a solid ratio in 2024 and their lack of major debt payments until late 2025.  \n",
            "- **Reasoning:**  The report states \"DVN’s long-term debt at year-end 2022 stood at $6.2 billion, down from $6.5 billion at year-end 2021. Relative to projected 2023 EBITDA, we calculate this is a ratio of 0.7x, an improvement from 1.95x at mid-2020.\"  It also notes \"Barring a major step back in crude oil prices, we think DVN can maintain a solid ratio in 2024.

            "- **Reasoning:** The report mentions \"Recent bolt-on M&A purchases have added to DVN’s capital spending, but operating cash flow does not look like it will keep pace, leading to slightly lower free cash flow in 2023 than in 2022.\" \n",
