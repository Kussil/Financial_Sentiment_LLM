      "CORPORATE OVERVIEW. Until mid-2011, Marathon Oil (MRO, formerly USX-Marathon Group, a part of USX\n",
      "Corp.) was engaged in three operating segments: Exploration & Production; Oil Sands Mining, Refining,\n",
      "Marketing, and Transportation; and Integrated Gas. In June 2011, MRO spun off its downstream RM&T\n",
      "business into a new publicly traded entity, Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC 175 ***}, and, in June 2017, sold\n",
      "its former Oil Sands division in Canada. MRO now operates just two segments—U.S. E&P and International\n",
      "ESP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s estimated proved reserves, as of December 31, 2023, totaled approximately 1.3 bboe (billion\n",
      "barrels of oil equivalent], in line with 2022 levels. At this estimated level, and assuming that 2023 production\n",
      "levels could be held constant, MRO’s estimated reserve life (the amount of time it would take before such\n",
      "reserves would be exhausted] is 8.9 years, which is well below the peer average of about 15 years. As a\n",
      "result, while replacing reserves is an issue for any oil and gas producer, in our view, this takes on acute\n",
      "significance for MRO.\n",
      "\n",
      "MRO possesses a fairly diverse set of assets in the U.S., with four different regions contributing significant\n",
      "production. The U.S. EGP segment (355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023, up 71,000 boe/d\n",
      "versus 2022 production) was comprised of Eagle Ford shale assets in South Texas (151,000 boe/d), the\n",
      "Bakken Shale (111,000 boe/d), Oklahoma Resource plays (50,000 boe/d), the Permian Basin (41,000 boe/\n",

      "\n",
      "U.S. acreage acquisitions have been fairly frequent in the last few years. In 2018, MRO acquired an additional\n",
      "61,000 acres in Oklahoma, on top of its existing 265,000 acres, which we think will add meaningfully to its\n",
      "liquids production in the state going forward. In addition, MRO purchased 70,000 net acres in the Northern\n",
      "Delaware section of the Permian Basin for $1.9 billion, an average price of about $27,000 per acre. We view\n",
      "this as a reasonable price for Permian acreage, although a premium to many other shale plays. In the fourth\n",
      "quarter of 2019, MRO acquired approximately 18,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford for $191 million and\n",
      "approximately 40,000 acres in a Texas Delaware oil play in West Texas for $106 million. As of December 31,\n",
      "2023, MRO’s held net acreage stood at 1,113,000 acres (down from 1,176,000 acres in 2022), with the U.S.\n",

      "\n",
      "The company’s International EGP segment (50,000 boe/d in 2023, down 9,000 boe/d from 2022) now\n",
      "consists solely of acreage in Equatorial Guinea.\n",
      "\n",
      "MRO has made recent improvements in its cost structure. In 2023, MRO achieved an average production\n",
      "cost of $10.13/boe, down 3% from $10.42/boe in 2022. Meanwhile, costs in Equatorial Guinea grew 36% to\n",
      "$4.13/boe. Essentially, the gap in costs between the two regions closed, but production costs in Africa\n",
      "remain considerably lower than those in the U.S.\n",
      "\n",
      "CORPORATE STRATEGY. MRO’s growth assets are where it expects to make significant investments in order\n",
      "to realize oil and gas production and reserve increases. It is focused on U.S. growth by developing liquids-\n",
      "rich shale play positions, a strong position in the core of the Eagle Ford shale and in the Bakken shale. As of\n",

      "approximately nine rigs and four frac crews on average in 2024 while keeping production levels flat.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. Over 2017-2020, MRO has steadily pursued non-core asset sales to\n",
      "streamline the company to a handful of core plays. Almost all of this activity has been outside North\n",
      "America, although the largest proceeds came from its 2017 sale of its former Canadian operations for $2.5\n",
      "billion. In 2019, MRO sold its former U.K. assets for $95 million, along with its Kurdistan assets for $63\n",
      "million. In 2018, MRO sold its former Libya assets for $450 million. Collectively, from 2017 through 2019,\n",
      "MRO sold assets that yielded net proceeds of roughly $3.0 billion.\n",

      "prior $0.10 per share. The implied annual dividend of $0.44 per share is a 1.8% dividend yield. In addition,\n",
      "MRO has aggressively repurchased around $5 billion of shares since October 2021, reducing its share count\n",
      "by about 27%. In 2023, MRO generated around $2 billion in free cash flow, in line with $2 billion in 2022. We\n",

      "\n",
      "**Production:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sentiment: Neutral**\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** The report indicates that MRO expects production levels to remain flat in 2024.  While there is some mention of potential challenges, such as weaker international volumes, the overall production outlook is not strongly positive or negative.\n",

      "**Reserves / Exploration / Acquisitions / Mergers / Divestments:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sentiment: Positive**\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** The report focuses on MRO's growth strategy, which emphasizes developing liquids-rich shale play positions and acquiring new acreage.  The report mentions recent acquisitions, such as the purchase of acreage in the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford.\n",

      "**Environment / Regulatory / Geopolitics:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Sentiment: Negative**\n",
      "- **Reasoning:** The report expresses concerns about potential regulatory changes, particularly in the Bakken Shale, which could impact MRO's operations. It also mentions the possibility of a court-ordered shutdown of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which could indirectly impact crude oil pricing.\n",

      "**Alternative Energy / Lower Carbon:**\n",

      "**Oil Price / Natural Gas Price / Gasoline Price:**\n",
