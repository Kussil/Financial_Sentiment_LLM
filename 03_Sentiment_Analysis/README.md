# 03_Sentiment_Analysis Folder

This folder contains the sentiment analysis notebooks and outputs. Note that the next folder, 04_Stock_Modeling, will reference all of the models shown in each subfolder below. However, our final app only uses sentiment analysis from Google Gemini. This [folder](./Gemini/Prompt2) contains the final version of the files used in our app. Below is a brief description of each subfolder and its purposes. All notebooks are designed to run in Google Colab unless specified in the description.
