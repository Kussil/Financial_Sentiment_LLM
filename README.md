- Paste the URL of the GitHub repository or enter the username to browse repositories.
- Choose the desired notebook file (`.ipynb`) from the repository.

### Step 3: Accessing Data from the Repository
After cloning, access files using:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('/content/repository/datafile.csv')

### Step 4: Saving Your Notebook
To save changes back to GitHub:
- Choose File > Save a copy in GitHub.
- Authorize Colab if prompted.
