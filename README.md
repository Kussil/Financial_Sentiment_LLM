We containerized the web application by creating a Docker image that includes only the essential files and dependencies required to run the app, ensuring a minimal and efficient container. This container was built using Docker Buildx to guarantee compatibility with Azure's AMD architecture. The Docker image was then tagged and pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) for easy management and deployment. We configured the Azure Web App to pull and use this Docker image directly from the ACR using Azure CLI commands, ensuring that the updated and fixed version of the application is deployed and running smoothly in the Azure environment. This work was done on the current branch, which includes all recent bug fixes and updates necessary for the deployment.
