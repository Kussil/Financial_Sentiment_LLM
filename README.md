# Financial Analysis Sentiment Tool

## Description
Understanding the dynamics of stock prices is a significant challenge in financial market research (Shen & Shafiq, 2020). Traditionally, researchers have focused on predicting future stock movements based on historical price data (Fama, 1970; Gordon, 1959). However, the vast amount of data generated daily by the stock market makes it increasingly difficult to consider all current and historical information effectively (Li et al., 2017; Hariri et al., 2019).

This project aims to analyze stock prices and/or total market capitalization of around 20 industry-related competitors (e.g., Chevron, Exxon, Shell) based on various factors. The specific goals include:
- Developing a News Sentiment Analysis Tool: Analyzing sentiment from news articles, financial reports, and extensive documents.
- Determining Feature Importance to Predict Stock Price Movement: Identifying key factors that significantly influence stock price movements.
- Explaining Stock Price Movements Using News Articles: Finding relevant documents and references explaining stock price movements.
- Delivering a Comprehensive Analysis Report: Producing detailed reports summarizing the findings.

# Using GitHub Repositories in Google Colab

This guide explains how to link and use GitHub repositories in Google Colab, enabling you to run notebooks and access files directly from GitHub.

## Step 1: Open Google Colab

Access Google Colab by visiting [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and start a new notebook.

## Step 2: Linking GitHub Repository

To use notebooks from GitHub:
- In your Colab notebook, navigate to `File` > `Open notebook`.
- Switch to the "GitHub" tab in the dialog that appears.
- Paste the URL of the GitHub repository or enter the username to browse repositories.
- Choose the desired notebook file (`.ipynb`) from the repository.



## Step 3: Accessing Data from the Repository
After cloning, access files using:
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('/content/repository/datafile.csv')
## Step 4: Saving Your Notebook
To save changes back to GitHub:

Choose File > Save a copy in GitHub.
Authorize Colab if prompted.
Select the target repository and branch.
Enter a commit message and click "OK".
