      "fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and\n",

      "to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to\n",

      "Majority\n",
      "ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which\n",
      "subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may indicate that a\n",
      "majority-owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted\n",
      "for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the\n",
      "minority shareholders are granted by law or by contract substantive\n",
      "participating rights. These include the right to approve operating policies,\n",
      "expense budgets, financing and investment plans, and management compensation\n",
      "and succession plans. \n",
      "Evidence\n",
      "of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investments in companies\n",
      "accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence\n",
      "represents a loss in value of the Corporation’s investment that is other than\n",
      "temporary. Examples of key indicators include a history of operating losses,\n",
      "negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil\n",
      "and gas reserves, and the financial condition and prospects for the investee’s\n",
      "business segment or geographic region. If evidence of an other than temporary\n",
      "loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined, an impairment is\n",

      "flows are used to assess fair value. \n",

      "in equity securities other than consolidated subsidiaries and equity method\n",

      "that do not have a readily determinable fair value. This modified approach\n",

      "accrued when the sale is recognized, and are finalized when the price is\n",
      "available. Such adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied\n",
      "in previous periods are not significant. Payment for revenue transactions is\n",
      "typically due within 30 days. Future volume delivery obligations that are\n",
      "unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through\n",

      "operating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include: \n",
      " \n",
      "Supply and\n",
      "Demand \n",
      "The oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are\n",
      "fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and\n",
      "earnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical\n",
      "prices and by changes in margins on refined products. Oil, gas, petrochemical,\n",
      "and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global\n",
      "events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any\n",
      "material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse\n",
      "effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Upstream\n",
      "segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. On the other hand, a\n",
      "material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse\n",
      "effect on certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Downstream and\n",
      "Chemical segments.\n",
      "Economic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is\n",
      "generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities and levels of\n",
      "prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative\n",
      "economic growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results.\n",
      "Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a\n",
      "major region, such as changes in population growth rates, periods of civil\n",
      "unrest, government austerity programs, or currency exchange rate fluctuations,\n",
      "can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt\n",
      "downgrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal\n",
      "constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of fiscal,\n",
      "monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or\n",
      "conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions\n",
      "also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial\n",
      "assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their\n",
      "commitments to ExxonMobil.\n",
      "Other demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand\n",
      "for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our results, include\n",
      "technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns;\n",
      "increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources; changes in technology\n",
      "or consumer preferences that alter fuel choices, such as technological advances\n",
      "in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power\n",
      "generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicles;\n",
      "and broad-based changes in personal income levels. \n",
      "Other supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary\n",
      "depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For example, increased\n",
      "supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies\n",
      "to enhance recovery from existing sources tend to reduce commodity prices to\n",
      "the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in\n",
      "demand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical\n",
      "manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins on the\n",
      "affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be\n",
      "affected by factors that reduce available supplies, such as adherence by countries\n",
      "to OPEC production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, and the occurrence\n",
      "of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in competitors’\n",
      "operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution\n",
      "channels that may disrupt supplies. Technological change can also alter the\n",
      "relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to\n",
      "manufacture petrochemicals. \n",
      "Other market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also\n",
      "exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates,\n",
      "inflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market\n",
      "conditions. \n",
      " \n",
      "Government and Political Factors \n",
      "ExxonMobil’s results can be adversely affected by political\n",

      "Access limitations. A number of countries limit access to\n",
      "their oil and gas resources, or may place resources off-limits from development\n",
      "altogether. Restrictions on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend\n",
      "to increase in times of high commodity prices, when national governments may\n",
      "have less need of outside sources of private capital. Many countries also\n",
      "restrict the import or export of certain products based on point of origin. \n",
      "Restrictions on doing business. ExxonMobil is subject to laws and\n",
      "sanctions imposed by the United States or by other jurisdictions where we do\n",
      "business that may prohibit ExxonMobil or certain of its affiliates from doing\n",
      "business in certain countries, or restricting the kind of business that may be\n",
      "conducted. Such restrictions may provide a competitive advantage to competitors\n",
      "who may not be subject to comparable restrictions. \n",
      "Lack of legal certainty. Some countries in which we do business\n",
      "lack well-developed legal systems, or have not yet adopted, or may be unable to\n",
      "maintain, clear regulatory frameworks for oil and gas development. Lack of\n",
      "legal certainty exposes our operations to increased risk of adverse or\n",
      "unpredictable actions by government officials, and also makes it more difficult\n",
      "for us to enforce our contracts. In some cases these risks can be partially\n",
      "offset by agreements to arbitrate disputes in an international forum, but the\n",

      "subsidiaries are consolidated. However, certain factors may indicate that a\n",

      "for using the equity method of accounting. These factors occur where the\n",

      "negative earnings and cash flow outlook, significant downward revisions to oil\n",
