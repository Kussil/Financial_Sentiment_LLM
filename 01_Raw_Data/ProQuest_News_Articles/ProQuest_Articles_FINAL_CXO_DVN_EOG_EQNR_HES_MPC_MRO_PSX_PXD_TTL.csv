Marathon Petroleum said it is shutting some of the units at its Garyville, La., refinery as it works to fully extinguish a fire that broke out Friday morning.
The partial shutdown of the refinery, which at nearly 600,000 barrels a day of crude-refining capacity makes it one of the nation's largest refineries, is causing gasoline and diesel fuel prices to trade sharply higher in futures markets. Diesel futures settled 4.8% higher Friday at $3.31 a gallon, the highest closing price since Jan. 26.
""Out of an abundance of caution, the facility began a shutdown process of units closest to the fire this morning,"" Marathon said in an emailed statement. ""As the fire-suppression efforts continue to progress, facility operations will continue to be evaluated, with safety as our top priority.""
The fire broke out in an area where crude oil and fuels are stored in massive, circular tanks. Local television footage showed two of the huge tanks fully engulfed in fire, with flames and thick black smoke shooting several stories into the air while two water cannons within the plant tried to douse the flames.
A cause of the fire is unknown, but Marathon said an investigation is under way. An earlier statement from the refinery indicated there was also a leak of naphtha, a flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture, but it isn't clear if that had anything to with causing the fire.
""The fire is currently under control and has remained within the common containment-dike area of two tanks on the refinery's property,"" it said, noting the fire isn't out completely yet. ""Both tanks have sustained damage.""
Marathon said one firefighter was being evaluated for heat stress, but reported no other injuries.
As a precaution, St. John the Baptist Parish required its residents living within a two-mile radius of the part of the refinery closest to the fire to temporarily evacuate to locations made available by the Parish.
The Garyville refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and according to Marathon's website, the plant has a crude-oil refining capacity of 596,000 barrels per calendar day.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
It is a great time to be an American refiner.
Marathon Petroleum Corp. on Tuesday said its refining and marketing segment generated $4.6 billion in segment income from operations -- nine times what it did a year earlier. Its shares rose nearly 2% on the day. Valero Energy Corp., which reported last week, saw its net profit swell to $2.9 billion in the third quarter from just over half a billion a year earlier. While margins have come down since the records set in the second quarter, they are multiples of prepandemic norms.
Marathon's gross profit for the quarter more than doubled year over year to $30.21 a barrel. Valero's was $21.34 a barrel, also more than doubling. In the five years leading up to 2019, the average gross profit for Valero's third quarter was less than $11 a barrel. Despite complaints about pump prices from the White House, refiners are running full tilt in such business conditions. Marathon's and Valero's utilization rates were 98% and 95% in the quarter, respectively.
And they have some tailwinds working in their favor. One is that a significant input cost -- natural gas -- remains much cheaper in the U.S. thanin Europe. Even though a warm start to winter helped natural-gas prices descend from their peak in Europe, the Dutch benchmark price is roughly six times as expensive as that of the U.S. High natural-gas prices are ""setting a higher floor on margins,"" Valero Energy Chief Executive Joseph Gorder said in the company's earnings call last Tuesday.
Furthermore, the price U.S. refiners pay for the heavy, sour crude for which many refineries are optimized has been decreasing relative to light, sweet varieties. Part of that is because sanctions on Russia caused a reshuffling: Indian and Chinese refiners are using up heavily discounted Urals oil from Russia in lieu of other heavy varieties. That ""backed up Mars and heavy Canadian [crude]"" into the Gulf Coast, according to Valero. Mars is a sour grade of crude produced in the U.S.
Higher-than-expected maintenance at U.S. refiners -- some of which deferred maintenance in the second quarter -- contributed to the glut.
There are some additional factors adding to the sulfur-heavy sour crude discount: High natural-gas prices spurred European refiners to buy light, sweet crude oil, which is less energy-intensive and less hydrogen-intensive to process than sour crude. IMO 2020, an international rule that limits sulfur content in marine fuels, compounds that effect by raising demand for lower-sulfur fuel.
An economic downturn could ruin the party for refiners. Gary Simmons, chief commercial officer at Valero, said last week that petroleum-product demand was hit twice as hard as gross domestic product in prior recessionary periods. But he noted two ""unique situations"" will prop up fuel demand. First, jet fuel demand is recovering. The U.S. Energy Information Administration figures show U.S. jet fuel demand is 19% lower than what it was in 2019. Second, Chinese oil demand, which has been down by one-fifth, should bounce back once the country comes out of the pandemic. Marathon Chief Executive Michael Hennigan reminded investors on Tuesday that roughly 4 million barrels a day of refining capacity was shut down globally over the past couple of years.
Winter should continue to be supportive. Distillate demand tends to move higher in the winter as power plants in Europe and the U.S. Northeast switch from expensive natural gas to heating oil. U.S. diesel inventoriesfor October were the lowest seen in that month since 1951, per EIA data, at about one-fifth below the five-year average.
A downturn is always a risk, but U.S. refiners look better equipped than ever to power through it.

Marathon Petroleum's quarterly profits and revenue soared past expectations thanks to tight refining capacity and strong demand for oil products.
The oil refiner reported a profit of $10.61 per share in the second quarter versus the consensus call of $8.92 a share among analysts tracked by FactSet. Revenue of $54.24 billion was ahead of Wall Street estimates of $40.34 billion. In the same quarter a year earlier, the company earned 67 cents a share from revenue of $29.83 billion.
The stock (ticker: MPC) rose 2.4% to $92.53 on Tuesday morning.
Oil and natural-gas prices have taken off since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up more than 55% by mid-June from the start of the year, also benefiting companies such as Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).
For Marathon, this has meant higher profits. Its refining and marketing margins tripled to $37.54 a barrel in the quarter ended in June from $12.45 in the same period last year.
The company was using nearly 100% of its crude-oil refining capacity in the quarter, lifting throughput, or the amount of oil processed each day, to 3.1 million barrels. Analysts were expecting 2.96 million barrels a day. In the second quarter last year, utilization was 94%, or 2.9 million barrels a day.
""We accomplished a lot during the quarter,"" said CEO Michael J. Hennigan. ""Our team delivered on supplying products to meet strong market demand…""
The company expects throughput of 2.9 million barrels in the third quarter, while the FactSet consensus forecast is for 2.94 million.

| Jump to first hitThe Federal Election Commission hit Marathon Petroleum Company with a $85,000 fine in February. Because Marathon has contracts with the federal government, it's barred from making political contributions. The oil refinery and transportation company give $500,000 apiece to 2 Republican political committees.
The Federal Election Commission levied a $85,000 fine against Marathon Petroleum Company after it illegally contributed $1 million to a pair of political action committees supporting House and Senate Republicans' re-election campaigns.
In the summer of 2020, the oil refinery and transportation giant contributed $500,000 apiece to the Senate Leadership Fund and the Congressional Leadership Fund, two political action committees that spend money on ads to boost Republicans in Senate and House elections, respectively.
But there was one problem: Marathon has contracts with the federal government, and federal campaign finance laws prohibit federal contractors from making any political contributions while negotiating or performing federal contracts.
In October 2020, the Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the commission. Both political action committees quickly informed the commission the following month that they did not know Marathon was a federal contractor at the time they received the contributions.
In its own January 2021 response, Marathon argued that ""had not historically engaged in federal government contracting"" and the company's lawyers were ""unaware"" that the company ""was negotiating, had entered into, or was performing a federal government contract at the time of the contributions.""
The oil giant asked that the commission exercise discretion and simply dismiss the complaint, arguing that the contributions had already been refunded and the contributions were a result of ""innocent oversight.""
But the commission's legal counsel disagreed, writing in August 2021 that Marathon's ""argument that its federal contract work represented a 'small percentage' of its business does not negate the company's status as a federal contractor.""
Further, they wrote that the company's $1 million in political spending constituted the ""largest federal contractor contributions to an [outside spending group] that the Commission has considered in an enforcement matter.""
In February, the commission unanimously voted to accept a conciliation agreement with the company, leaving Marathon with the $85,000 fine and a pledge to not violate campaign finance laws again.
The company paid the fine last week.
It's not the only fine the commission issued last month against federal contractors who made political contributions.
The commission also hit 3M Company with a $4,500 fine after it contributed $50,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund in 2018, and hit TonerQuest with a $4,700 fine after it gave $25,000 to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC, in 2019."

WASHINGTON—The 7-Eleven convenience store chain said Friday it had completed a $21 billion acquisition of Marathon Petroleum Corp.'s Speedway convenience stores, amid disarray from U.S. antitrust enforcers who hadn't agreed on what to do about a transaction they all said they believed was anticompetitive.
7-Eleven, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Seven & I Holdings Co., reached the deal with Marathon last August, which adds roughly 3,800 Speedway stores in 36 states to its business . 7-Eleven said the transaction allowed it to expand its footprint and diversify its presence in 47 of the 50 most populated U.S. metro areas.
The timing of the acquisition's consummation was unusual because Democrats and Republicans at the Federal Trade Commission each said they had reasons to believe the transaction was unlawful, though the two camps, in dueling statements, signaled there wasn't consensus, at least not yet, on how to address those concerns.
7-Eleven in a statement said it had negotiated a settlement with FTC staffers and thought it had a deal in place to address competitive concerns by divesting 293 stores, whose buyers were vetted and blessed by FTC investigators.
Such agreements still need formal approval by the commission.
""7-Eleven will continue to work with them to ensure that 7-Eleven meets its obligations under the negotiated settlement,"" the company said. ""We are hopeful that the Commission will approve the negotiated settlement agreement in the near term.""
Acting Chairwoman Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Commissioner Rohit Chopra, both Democrats, said they thought the transaction ""is illegal"" and raises ""significant competitive concerns in hundreds of local retail gasoline and diesel fuel markets across the country.""
The FTC, they said, ""has spent significant resources investigating this transaction but hasn't yet come to an agreement with the parties and a majority of the commission that would fully resolve the competitive concerns. Seven and Marathon's decision to close under these circumstances is highly unusual, and we are extremely troubled by it.""
The commission's two Republicans, Commissioners Noah Phillips and Christine Wilson, likewise said they believed the companies had hundreds of overlapping gasoline and convenience stores and combining them in certain markets would ""violate the antitrust laws.""
""There is no good reason for the commission to be in this mess,"" they said in a joint statement, referring to the FTC's inability to finalize a decision. The Republicans said they ""have been given no information suggesting the parties failed to work constructively with staff to negotiate a timely and effective resolution.""
Neither statement made clear what exactly had prevented the FTC from making a decision on how to proceed.
The FTC is a five-member body, with one seat currently vacant. President Biden has nominated Lina Khan, a big-tech critic who favors aggressive antitrust enforcement , to fill it. The commission needs majority support for any course of action.
Companies normally wait for resolution with U.S. antitrust authorities before completing their transactions, but the government doesn't have unlimited time to make up its mind.
Even though the transaction has closed, the companies and the FTC still potentially could reach a settlement. The commission also still has the option to challenge the acquisition if it chooses, though the government generally challenges mergers before they are finalized.

Fuel maker Marathon Petroleum Corp. said it has agreed to sell its gas stations to the owners of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain for $21 billion in the largest U.S. energy-related deal of the year.
The all-cash agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. comes less than a year after Marathon agreed to spin off its convenience-store chain, known as Speedway, under pressure from activist investors including Elliott Management Corp.
Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon had been close to a deal with Seven & I Holdings Co., the Japanese parent of 7-Eleven Inc., earlier this year, but talks fell apart in March as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.
The company revived sales discussions months later, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. Other suitors included Canada-based convenience- store chain Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc.
""Our announcement crystalizes the significant value of the Speedway business, creates certainty around value realization and delivers on our commitment to unlock the value of our assets,"" Marathon Chief Executive Michael Hennigan said.
""This was the chance of a lifetime,"" said Ryuichi Isaka, president of Seven & I Holdings. He said he saw convenience stores in the U.S. as the biggest growth driver for the company, whose department stores and supermarkets in Japan are struggling.
The Speedway deal includes about 3,900 convenience stores and would bring 7-Eleven's retail footprint in the U.S. and Canada to around 14,000 locations.
Under the agreement, expected to close early next year, Marathon would supply 7-Eleven with about 7.7 billion gallons of fuel a year for 15 years.
""This acquisition is the largest in our company's history and will allow us to continue to grow and diversify our presence in the U.S., particularly in the Midwest and East Coast,"" 7-Eleven Chief Executive Joe DePinto said in a statement. ""By adding these quality locations to our portfolio, 7-Eleven will have the opportunity to bring convenience to more customers than ever before.""
There has been a flurry of energy deals in recent weeks during what has otherwise been a slow year for oil-and-gas-related acquisitions. Last month, Chevron Corp. agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. signed a deal to buy Dominion Energy Inc.'s natural-gas storage and transmission network for $4 billion, excluding debt.
Marathon's sale of its gas-station chain would provide a cash infusion for a company that, like other U.S. refiners, has been badly bruised by a decline in fuel demand because of the pandemic. It told employees Friday that it has no plans to restart two refineries that it idled this spring.
The company said it expects the deal to generate about $16.5 billion in after-tax proceeds, which it plans to use to pare debt and ""return capital to shareholders"".
Marathon, which reports second-quarter earnings Monday, posted a $9.2 billion first-quarter loss, its largest on record, in May as it took $12.4 billion in charges.
As of Friday, the company's shares had lost more than a third of their value since the end of last year, slightly more than the decline in U.S. benchmark oil prices.
Elliott has repeatedly called on Marathon to split into three businesses -- a gas-station chain, a pipeline business and a fuel-making operation -- saying the integrated model left the company undervalued.

Mr. Isaka, who formerly led the convenience-store business in Japan, said the company has been trying to transform its U.S. outlets to focus more on fresh food and private brand products.
Mr. Isaka said convenience-store sales have been rising during the coronavirus pandemic. As a result of the acquisition, about one-third of Seven & I's operating profit is expected to come from North America. In the year ended February 2020, Seven & I reported sales of ¥6.6 trillion ($62 billion) and operating profit of ¥424 billion ($4 billion).

Marathon Petroleum shares surged in early trading Friday after The Wall Street Journal
reported late Thursday
that the big U.S. refiner was considering a sale of its Speedway gasoline and convenience store business as an alternative to its planned spinoff of the valuable division.
Marathon shares (ticker: MPC) jumped 8% at the opening and were trading up nearly 5%, at $40.33 in Friday morning trading.
J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh calls a Speedway sale a ""silver bullet"" that would be superior to a spinoff that Marathon Petroleum is now targeting for early 2021 because it would result in substantial cash proceeds that could allow the company to retire debt and buy back stock. Gresh has a Neutral rating on the stock.
A Marathon Petroleum spokesman declined to comment on the Speedway sale report.
A major issue if Marathon does choose to sell Speedway, which the No. 2 operator of gasoline and convenience stores behind Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada, is the price that it could get. Gresh is assuming $15 billion in after-tax proceeds. Marathon indicated last fall that Speedway, which operates about 3,900 stores, was worth $15 billion to $18 billion.
Marathon, the largest independent U.S. refiner by capacity, also owns a sizable stake in a pipeline operator, MPLX (MPLX).
Barron's
wrote favorably on Marathon Petroleum
in May, arguing that the shares, then around $35, looked inexpensive based on a potential improvement in depressed refining margins and on a sum-of-the-parts basis. In the article, we argued that the stock could be worth at least $50 a share.
Refiners also stand to benefit from widening margins. A key Gulf Coast crack spread has nearly doubled this month, to nearly $8 a barrel. This spread measures the profit from refining crude oil into gasoline and other petroleum products.
One shareholder told Barron's on Friday that he would like to see proceeds of at least $20 billion from a potential sale of Speedway, or the company should proceed with the spinoff.
Last September, activist investor Elliott Management
put out a presentation
arguing that the shares, then around $55, were worth at least $89. Elliott held a stake of under 2% in Marathon Petroleum on March 31.

Marathon Petroleum Corp. is in discussions with potential buyers of its sprawling Speedway gas-station unit, reviving a sale that fell apart in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis.
Possible buyers include Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., people familiar with the matter said. It couldn't be determined how much the business might fetch, but Marathon indicated last fall that it could be valued at between $15 billion and $18 billion.
Any deal is likely weeks away, and Marathon might opt to stick with a plan to spin off the unit instead.
Marathon said last fall that it planned to separate the unit as part of an effort to appease activist investors including Elliott Management Corp. The fuel producer then held talks to sell the division and was close to a deal with Seven & I Holdings Co., the Japanese parent of 7-Eleven convenience stores, for more than $20 billion. But the deal fell through in March as the coronavirus pandemic began to roil markets and crimp economic activity, and the focus returned to a spinoff.
In a sign of the renewed possibility of a sale, Marathon recently pushed the expected timetable for a spinoff to the first quarter of 2021 from the end of this year.
Based in Findlay, Ohio, Marathon owns and operates roughly 4,000 convenience stores in the U.S., largely under the Speedway brand, making it one of the nation's biggest such chains. It also has long-term fuel-supply contracts with other gas stations.
Marathon and other refiners have had a difficult spring because of coronavirus lockdowns that eroded demand for the fuels they produce and squeezed margins. The company's market capitalization has fallen more than a third this year to around $25 billion, roughly tracking the slide in the price of U.S. benchmark crude, which fetched about $39 a barrel Thursday.
Typically, cheap oil is good for refiners because it stimulates demand at the pump, but that hasn't been the case this time around. Marathon's $9.2 billion first-quarter loss was its largest quarterly loss on record.
Michael Hennigan took over as Marathon's chief executive officer in mid-March after Gary Heminger stepped down under pressure from the activists.
As of earlier this year, Quebec-based Couche-Tard, which has a market value of roughly $35 billion, operated about 14,800 convenience stores around the world, including nearly 10,000 in North America.

Marathon Petroleum Corp. is in discussions with potential buyers of its sprawling Speedway gas-station unit, reviving a sale that fell apart in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis.
Possible buyers include Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., people familiar with the matter said. It couldn't be determined how much the business might fetch, but Marathon indicated last fall that it could be worth between $15 billion and $18 billion.
Any deal is likely weeks away, and Marathon might opt to stick with a plan to spin off the unit instead.
Marathon said last fall that it planned to separate the unit as part of an effort to appease activist investors including Elliott Management Corp. The fuel producer then held talks to sell the division and was close to a deal with Seven & I Holdings Co., the Japanese parent of 7-Eleven convenience stores, for more than $20 billion. But the deal fell through in March as the coronavirus pandemic began to roil markets and crimp economic activity, and the focus returned to a spinoff.
In a sign of the renewed possibility of a sale, Marathon recently pushed the expected timetable for a spinoff to the first quarter of 2021 from the end of this year.
Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon owns and operates roughly 4,000 convenience stores in the U.S., largely under the Speedway brand, making it one of the nation's biggest such chains. It also has long-term fuel-supply contracts with other gas stations.

Marathon Petroleum stock climbed early on Tuesday as the largest U.S. oil refiner reported a smaller-than-expected loss amid
collapsing fuel demand.

The Ohio-based company plummeted to a $9.2 billion, or $14.25 per share, loss in the first quarter compared to a loss of $7 million the previous year. The heavy loss was driven by a $12.4 billion impairment charge as fuel demand was hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, the adjusted loss of $0.16 per share beat the FactSet consensus of a $0.25 per share loss. The stock rose sharply in early trading before slipping back to trade 0.5% higher. It is trading 47% down year-to-date.
Retail earnings of $644 million - up from $296 million the previous year - convincingly beat expectations as higher retail margins delivered a strong quarter for gas station unit Speedway. Total revenue fell 16% to $24.1 billion, below analysts' estimates of $27.1 billion.
""Recent global events, including the Covid-19 pandemic and oil price tensions, have been disruptive to the personal and professional lives of many and significantly impacted demand for the transportation fuels we manufacture,"" CEO Michael Hennigan.
Marathon said it would
cut capital spending
by $1.4 billion - down to $3 billion for 2020 - with $770 million of those cuts at its midstream business, which includes MPLX. Operating expenses will also be reduced by $950 million in response to the pandemic, it said. The company issued $2.5 billion in senior notes in April and secured an additional $1 billion revolving credit facility.

Marathon said it continued to target the fourth quarter for the planned separation of Speedway but admitted the timing could be impacted by coronavirus.
Looking ahead. Cowen analysts, led by Jason Gabelman described the first quarter earnings as a ""modest positive"", maintaining a neutral rating on the stock. ""Income statement metrics were around the midpoint of guidance, while cash flow was at the low end and impairments at the high end."" They added that the company's retail outlook for the second quarter - sales to fall up to 35% from the first quarter - and uncertainty of the Speedway spin-off offset the positive update.

Chevron, Quest Diagnostics and HCA Healthcare were among the companies that declared dividend increases last week in a busy period for such announcements.

Chevron, a major integrated energy company,
declared a quarterly dividend of $1.29 a share, up 8.4%. Last year Chevron (CVX) increased its dividend by 6%.
The stock, which yields 4.8%, has a one-year loss of 6%, reflecting the difficulties energy companies have faced amid weaker oil prices.
Quest Diagnostics (DGX) declared a quarterly dividend of 56 cents a share, up 3 cents, for a boost of nearly 6%.
The medical testing company's
stock, which has a one-year return of nearly 30%, yields 1.9%.
HCA Healthcare (HCA) is planning to up its quarterly payout to 43 cents a share, up 7.5% from 50 cents. The stock yields 1.2%. Its one-year return is up slightly. The company's businesses include operating hospitals.
AmerisourceBergen (ABC), one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in the U.S., plans to raise its quarterly dividend by 5% to 42 cents a share. It's currently 40 cents.
The stock, which yields 2%, has a one-year return of about 4%.
Financial services firm Charles Schwab (SCHW) plans to boost its quarterly payout by a penny to 18 cents a share. That's an increase of 6%. Charles Schwab, whose one-year return is flat, yields 1.6%.
Alaska Air Group (ALK) declared a quarterly dividend of 37.5 cents a share, a 7% increase from 35 cents. The stock yields 2.3%. Its one-year return is about 2%. The company expanded its route network with its $2.6 billion acquisition of
Virgin America
, especially in California.
Tech company Juniper Networks (JNPR) plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 20 cents a share from 19 cents. That's a 5% increase. The stock, which yields 3.5%, is down 9% in the past 12 months.
The company's products include switching and routing equipment for data networks.
Chevron wasn't the only energy firm to announce a dividend increase last week.
Marathon Petroleum (MPC), an oil refiner, plans to boost its quarterly dividend to 58 cents a share from 53 cents. That's a little more than a 9% increase.
Factoring in the higher dividend, the yield would be about 4.2%, based on Friday's stock price. The stock is down 15% in the past 12 months— another example of how energy stocks have struggled.
Stifel Financial (SF) declared a 13.3% increase to its quarterly dividend, raising it to 17 cents a share from 15 cents. The stock, which yields about 1%, has a one-year return of nearly 34%. The brokerage firm is based in St. Louis.
Shareholders of Nexstar Media (NXST), which operates television stations and digital media properties, will be looking forward to a big boost in their quarterly payout. The company announced a 24% dividend hike to 56 cents a share.
The move closely follows the company's $7.2 billion acquisition last year of the Chicago-based Tribune Media, a deal that created the largest local television broadcaster in the U.S.
The stock, which yields 1.5%, has a one-year return of about 50%.
Comerica (CMA), a large regional bank based in Dallas, will be increasing its quarterly dividend as well.

The chief executive of fuel maker Marathon Petroleum Corp. is stepping down and the company is spinning off its gas-station chain to placate activist investors including Elliott Management Corp.
Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Heminger, 66 years old, plans to step down next year after more than eight years at the company's helm, Marathon said Thursday.
The Findlay, Ohio-based company, which has been under pressure by multiple shareholders in recent weeks, also is planning to review its pipeline business.
""We believe this separation will create two strong, industry-leading companies well-positioned for long-term growth and success,"" Mr. Heminger said of spinning off Marathon's gas-station operation, known as Speedway, into a separate company. He also told investors that the separation grew out of a company review that began in January.
Elliott proposed in September that Marathon separate its refining, pipeline and gas-station businesses, reprising a push that the hedge fund made three years ago. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group, another Marathon shareholder, also has supported such a breakup, according to people familiar with the matter.
Meanwhile, Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens, former board members of refiner Andeavor, which Marathon acquired last year, had advocated for replacing Mr. Heminger, who has led Marathon since 2011 when it was spun off from parent Marathon Oil Corp.
""I am grateful to Gary for his distinguished and successful leadership of this great company, for which he has earned the unqualified and unanimous support of the board,"" James Rohr, the company's lead independent director, said. The company said it has begun a search to replace Mr. Heminger.
Former Andeavor Chief Executive Gregory Goff, 63, who now serves as Marathon's executive vice chairman, also is planning to step down, effective at the end of this year. Some shareholders view Mr. Goff as a potential successor to Mr. Heminger, people familiar with the matter said.
Earlier this week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Marathon was preparing to spin off its gas-station chain and discussing Mr. Heminger's departure as part of a plan to appease activist shareholders.
This marks the second resolution in a week for Elliott, which on Monday reached a truce with AT&T Inc. The hedge fund had been pressuring the telecom giant to revamp its strategy since early September.
""The actions announced today will unlock substantial value for shareholders,"" Elliott said Thursday.
Refiners have been a rare bright spot in the energy industry as investors have soured on producers over lackluster returns. The value of Marathon's shares including reinvested dividends has roughly quadrupled under Mr. Heminger's leadership, far outpacing the S&P 500 index, FactSet data show.
However, the company has lagged behind peers since it agreed to buy rival Andeavor last year. Elliott has been critical of the deal, saying that Marathon shouldn't have pursued the transaction at a time when it had promised to consider simplification.
The new, independent gas-station operation will consist of the roughly 4,000 convenience stores that Marathon owns and operates, meaning it would be the largest such U.S.-listed company, Mr. Heminger said. He said Marathon intends to provide fuel to Speedway long-term and complete the spinoff by the end of 2020.
Marathon also has long-term fuel-supply contracts with other gas stations -- a portion of the business it plans to retain, the company said Thursday.
On Thursday, the company reported third-quarter profit of $1.1 billion, up from $737 million during the same period a year earlier.
Marathon shares dropped 3.4%, as the U.S. price of crude fell 1.6%.

Oil refiner Marathon Petroleum Corp. is preparing to spin off its gas-station chain and considering shaking up its executive leadership to appease activist shareholders including Elliott Management Corp., according to people familiar with the matter.
As part of a truce between the Findlay, Ohio, company and Elliott that could be announced as soon as this week, Marathon's board is discussing changes including a spinoff of its sprawling gas-station operation and potentially replacing Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Heminger and other executives, the people said.
The situation is fluid and the company, which is set to report earnings Thursday, may still end up reversing course on some or all of the moves.
Marathon owns and operates roughly 4,000 convenience stores in the U.S., largely under the Speedway brand, according to a securities filing, making it one of the nation's largest such chains.
It also has long-term fuel supply contracts with other gas stations.
Elliott proposed last month that Marathon split into a refining business, a pipeline operation and a gas-station chain, echoing a similar push three years ago by the hedge fund.
D.E. Shaw Group, another Marathon shareholder, also supports such a breakup, according to people familiar with the matter.
Members of the company's board have met in recent weeks with Elliott, D.E. Shaw and other large shareholders seeking change at the company, the largest U.S. oil refiner.
Meanwhile, Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens, former board members of Andeavor, which Marathon acquired last year, have pushed for Mr. Heminger's ouster and said they back portions of Elliott's restructuring proposal.
Mr. Heminger, 66 years old, has led Marathon since 2011, when the company was spun out of parent Marathon Oil Corp.
Messrs. Foster and Stevens, who own about 1.7% of Marathon's outstanding common shares, said in a recent letter that there was ""overwhelming support"" among investors for replacing Mr. Heminger as chairman and chief executive, citing conversations with roughly 100 shareholders.
The former Andeavor board members previously served as chairman and chief executive, respectively, of Western Refining, which Andeavor acquired in 2017.
As of Friday, Marathon stock had fallen roughly 16% since it agreed to buy Andeavor for roughly $23 billion last year.
Shares in Phillips 66, another independent refiner, rose about 3% in that time, while Valero Energy Corp. stock fell about 10%.
Refiners, which process oil into fuels such as gasoline and diesel, have benefited in recent years from soaring U.S. production and pipeline bottlenecks that damped crude prices in many regions, though geopolitical tensions have hampered performance recently.
Elliott, which has said its funds own about 2.5% of Marathon, has criticized the Andeavor deal, saying that Marathon shouldn't have acquired the refining company at a time when it said it would consider simplifying its corporate structure.
Some shareholders view former Andeavor Chief Executive Gregory Goff, 63, now Marathon's executive vice chairman, as a potential replacement for Mr. Heminger, people familiar with the matter said.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Elliott Management doesn't need to go the distance to make money at Marathon Petroleum.
The activist hedge fund run by Paul Singer is in the thick of some huge battles, agitating for overhauls at AT&T, eBay and PG&E. Its investment in oil midstream and refining business Marathon Petroleum is decidedly less exciting. That may be why it turns out to be one of its better bets.
The hedge fund sent a letter to the company's board of directors on Wednesday requesting that the Ohio-based business separate into three parts: a retail and convenience store operator; a midstream business that ships fuel; and a petroleum-refining company. In doing so, Elliott thinks Marathon could be $22 billion more valuable, or 60% more than its Tuesday closing price.
Elliott has been agitating at Marathon since 2016. It had similar requests at the time, but Marathon went another direction. Last year it bit off a big deal for Andeavor, paying $23 billion in cash and stock. That deal made Marathon the largest U.S. oil refiner and had some strategic logic. Production of fuel in the U.S. was projected to increase, refinery capacity is limited and the two companies had little geographic overlap.
The problem, Elliott argues, is that Marathon bought the company with an undervalued stock and it hasn't done well with integrating Andeavor. The market seems to agree. Since announcing the deal, Marathon's shares are off by more than 15%.
Marathon also seemingly hasn't taken advantage of certain dislocations in the U.S. refining sector. A scarcity of pipelines in the Permian Basin has put oil at a lower price inland. That, in theory, should help Marathon, which could buy crude cheaply, refine it and ship it to the coast for more money. While competitor Phillips 66's stock has increased more than 25% so far this year, though, Marathon's barely budged.
Separating the businesses has disadvantages. Though all are loosely involved with oil, they are somewhat uncorrelated. The steady cash flows of one can help offset another during a slump, and there are occasional synergies.
But Marathon's shares could benefit simply if Elliott spurs management to manage the company more effectively rather than split it up. Coming changes to maritime fuel guidelines, which could require more sophisticated refining techniques, also could help Marathon, which has complex coastal refineries.
Research analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt estimate the company's shares are worth almost one-quarter more than their level as of Tuesday's close.
Marathon could get there while hardly breaking a sweat.

Two large shareholders have sent a letter to Marathon Petroleum Corp. calling for the ouster of the fuel maker's chief executive.
Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens, former board members of refiner Andeavor, which Marathon acquired last year, back a proposal by hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. to split the company into three units.
But Messrs. Foster and Stevens, who said that they and their affiliates own about 1.7% of Marathon's common shares outstanding, went a step further in the letter sent to the company Thursday evening, calling for Chief Executive Gary Heminger to be replaced, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. They said Marathon had lost the confidence of top shareholders and criticized Mr. Heminger for ignoring their input.
""We are investors with a demonstrated track record operating refining, mid-stream and retail businesses on a sizable scale within this industry,"" the shareholders wrote. ""This experience, combined with Marathon's stagnation and destruction of value, causes us great concern with your decision to ignore our perspectives and insights.""
Messrs. Foster and Stevens served as chairman and chief executive, respectively, of Western Refining, which was acquired by Andeavor in 2017. Marathon bought Andeavor for $23 billion last year and is now the second-largest independent U.S. refiner by market capitalization.
A Marathon spokesman said the board unanimously supports Mr. Heminger as the company's chairman and chief executive, citing a ""track record of delivering value to shareholders and all of the company's constituencies.""
Elliott on Wednesday sent a letter to Marathon's board reviving its push to split the business in three: a gas-station chain, a pipeline company and a refining business. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group also supports breaking up Marathon and has been in conversations with the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Shares in Marathon have increased nearly 10% since Elliott sent its letter. As of the market close Tuesday, before Elliott's letter, Marathon's stock had declined roughly 32% since the company announced the Andeavor deal, while shares in fuel makers Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp. fell about 7% and 24%, respectively.
Messrs. Foster and Stevens said they agree with most of Elliott's proposals but believe the fund didn't go far enough. They also expressed frustration at not being able to have a ""meaningful private dialogue"" with Mr. Heminger or the company's lead independent director.

Foster and Stevens, who said that they and their affiliates own about 1.7% of Marathon's common shares outstanding, went a step further in the letter sent to the company Thursday evening, calling for Chief Executive Gary Heminger to be replaced, according to a copy reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. They said Marathon had lost the confidence of top shareholders and criticized Mr. Heminger for ignoring their input.
""We are investors with a demonstrated track record operating refining, mid-stream and retail businesses on a sizable scale within this industry,"" the shareholders wrote. ""This experience, combined with Marathon's stagnation and destruction of value, causes us great concern with your decision to ignore our perspectives and insights.""
Messrs. Foster and Stevens served as chairman and chief executive, respectively, of Western Refining, which was acquired by Andeavor in 2017. Marathon bought Andeavor for $23 billion last year and is now the second-largest independent U.S. refiner by market capitalization.
A Marathon spokesman said the board unanimously supports Mr. Heminger as the company's chairman and chief executive, citing a ""track record of delivering value to shareholders and all of the company's constituencies.""
Elliott on Wednesday sent a letter to Marathon's board reviving its push to split the business in three: a gas-station chain, a pipeline company and a refining business. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group also supports breaking up Marathon and has been in conversations with the company, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Shares in Marathon have increased nearly 10% since Elliott sent its letter. As of the market close Tuesday, before Elliott's letter, Marathon's stock had declined roughly 32% since the company announced the Andeavor deal, while shares in fuel makers Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp. fell about 7% and 24%, respectively.
Messrs. Foster and Stevens said they agree with most of Elliott's proposals but believe the fund didn't go far enough. They also expressed frustration at not being able to have a ""meaningful private dialogue"" with Mr. Heminger or the company's lead independent director.

Activist investment firm Elliott Management is pushing the oil company Marathon Petroleum to split into three units, separating its refining arm from its pipeline division and its Speedway-branded gas stations.
Marathon shares were up 6.1% in midday trading. Elliott made its case for a split in
a letter
to the Marathon board on Tuesday, saying the company has burned through shareholder value by pursuing a ""failed conglomerate model.""
Marathon didn't respond to a request for comment.
Elliott, which owns about 2.5% of Marathon's stock, has agitated for changes before. It told the company in 2016 to separate its businesses and simplify the corporate structure of its pipeline, or ""midstream"", segment.
Marathon did simplify the midstream operations, but decided against selling Speedway. That seemed enough to keep Elliott from upping the ante at the time.
But in the letter, Elliott says Marathon doubled down on its conglomerate model by buying the oil company Andeavor in 2018. ""This disingenuous set of actions has seriously undermined the Company's credibility with shareholders, who now have reason to doubt that promises made by the Board and management will in fact be kept,"" the letter says.
""The Andeavor transaction created a new, larger and even more complex Marathon structure, which we believe compounded the Company's historical valuation issues.""
Since the Andeavor deal was announced in April 2018, Marathon shares have trailed behind the broader refining industry by 23%, Elliott calculates. Following Elliott's strategy could allow the stock to double, the firm said.
Elliott has questioned conglomerate structures at other companies too. Most recently, it pushed for a strategic review at AT&T (T).

Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. sent a letter to Marathon Petroleum Corp.'s board Wednesday proposing again that the fuel maker split into three different companies.
Elliott's letter asked Marathon, which has struggled this year as fuel makers have faced higher prices for crude, to separate its Speedway gas-station chain and its pipeline business into their own companies, and leave Marathon's refining business as the new Marathon.
""There is little to no 'synergy' value to retaining the three businesses in Marathon,"" Elliott said in the letter.
Marathon, the second-largest independent U.S. refiner by market capitalization, said it would ""continue to evaluate opportunities to deliver more value for our shareholders.""
""We will thoroughly evaluate Elliott's proposal and look forward to continuing our constructive engagement around these issues,"" the company said.
Marathon shares increased more than 8% Wednesday, as the U.S. benchmark oil price fell 1.4%.
Fuel makers had been a bright spot in the flagging U.S. energy industry but have
hit a rough patch recently
amid heightened geopolitical tensions that have reduced the availability of heavier varieties of crude. Companies rely on a combination of heavy and light oil to make fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
As of market close Tuesday, before Elliott's letter, Marathon's stock had declined roughly 32% since the company agreed to a $23 billion
deal last year to acquire
rival Andeavor. Shares in refiners Phillips 66 and Valero Energy Corp. fell roughly 7% and 24%, respectively, in that time.
Elliott, which said its funds own about a 2.5% economic interest in Marathon, criticized the Andeavor purchase, saying that Marathon pursued another integrated refining company at a time when it said it would consider simplifying its corporate structure.
""Thus, while Marathon executives were telling investors that they were taking a critical look at their structure, they were in fact already contemplating and in the process of executing a massive recommitment to their failed conglomerate model,"" Elliott said.
Elliott isn't the only activist shareholder that has set its eyes on Marathon. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw has a similar-sized stake in the fuel maker, and it is also supportive of the company breaking up, according to a person familiar with the matter. D.E. Shaw has been in conversations with Marathon, the person said.
Marathon Chief Executive Gary Heminger told investors in August that the company was assessing potential asset sales.
""We are an asset-rich company. We will look at some assets that probably have more value in somebody else's portfolio than ours and proceed accordingly,"" he said.
Elliott also asked Marathon to review its management and board structures.
The firm's request echoes the change it sought at Marathon three years ago. The activist investor then asked Marathon to review its structure and divide itself into three different businesses.
In its latest letter to Marathon, Elliott said: ""While our previous engagement concluded with promises from management and the Board that certain steps would be taken to improve performance, those promises have not been kept.""
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. analyst Matthew Blair characterized Elliott's proposal to split Marathon in three as extreme but said the company's parts are indeed more valuable than their sum.

Marathon Petroleum Corp. on Thursday said Donald Templin would return to the role of finance chief as part of a broader executive restructuring at the oil refiner.
Mr. Templin, who serves as president of refining, marketing and supply, will replace Timothy Griffith, who is moving to the Marathon subsidiary Speedway LLC.
Mr. Griffith, in turn, will replace longtime President Anthony Kenney, who is retiring after 43 years with Speedway. Mr. Kenney has led that business since 2005.
Mr. Templin, who joined Findlay, Ohio-based Marathon in 2011 as CFO, left that role in 2015 as he took on other high-level positions within the company and its subsidiaries. In 2012, he also became CFO of midstream company MPLX LP,
in which Marathon owns a stake
.
Before joining Marathon, Mr. Templin was the managing partner of an audit practice at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Marathon, which operates one of the largest refining systems in the U.S., closed a $23.3 billion
merger
with San Antonio-based Andeavor late last year. The combined company reported first-quarter revenue of $28.62 billion, up 50.1% from the same period of 2018.
The company posted a loss of $7 million in the period, however, compared with earnings of $37 million a year earlier. Its net loss was 1 cent a share, compared with a profit of 8 cents a share. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting earnings of 8 cents a share.
Cowen analysts last month downgraded Marathon to ""market perform,"" adding that investors likely will be more cautious because of a higher-than-expected postmerger cost structure.
The company declined to comment on the appointment.
The announcement was made after the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. Shares were trading down 0.2% at $51.87 in after-hours trading Thursday evening.

ConocoPhillips is to buy Concho Resources in a deal worth $9.7bn, as one of the largest independent oil producers gambles on a post-pandemic market recovery with a huge bet on US shale.
The deal will make Conoco a commanding participant in the US shale patch and transform its position in the Permian, the most prolific oilfield, where its output will rival that of ExxonMobil.
""Today's transaction is an affirmation of our commitment to lead a structural change for our vital industry,"" said Ryan Lance, Conoco chief executive. ""Together, ConocoPhillips and Concho will have unmatched scale and quality across the important value drivers in our business.""
Under the all-share transaction, Concho investors will receive 1.46 shares of Conoco stock for each of their own, a 15 per cent premium to closing share prices on October 13. Conoco said the combined group would have an enterprise value of $60bn. Concho chief executive Tim Leach would join the Conoco board.
The deal is the third big acquisition in the shale patch since the pandemic. Chevron agreed to buy Noble Energy in July in a $13bn transaction, while Devon Energy last month agreed to take over rival WPX for $12bn.
The Conoco deal follows months of brutal cost-cutting and bankruptcies in the US oil patch, where production has fallen from a record near 13m barrels a day to about 11m b/d. Analysts said Conoco's move showed that big oil groups were ready to use the crash, which has driven asset valuations to multiyear lows, to build scale in shale.
""ConocoPhillips is adding enough Permian production to nip at the heels of ExxonMobil's massive programme,"" said Robert Clarke, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Conoco said the combined companies would hold a resource base of 23bn barrels of oil equivalent with an average supply cost of less than $30 a barrel, and would produce 1.5m barrels of oil and gas a day.
The group's operations include assets in Australia, Asia-Pacific and Canada. Its production from the Permian shale in Texas and New Mexico was less than 100,000 b/d last year.
Concho produced just over 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day last year. In a sector that became notorious in recent years for its failure to generate profits or return capital, it was considered one of the better performers. Ian Nieboer, head of oil research at Enverus, said it offered ""quality assets, sufficient scale and an inventory of rich areas to be drilled"". Lex page 20

Any lingering doubts about the wave of consolidation engulfing the US oil and gas industry were put to rest by ConocoPhillips' all-stock deal for Concho Resources yesterday.
Valued at $13.3bn including debt, this is not only the year's biggest deal but the third big transaction in the US shale industry in under three months. All three — struck at little or no premium — offer a marked contrast to Occidental Petroleum's pricey $55bn acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year. Patience is truly a virtue.
Like Chevron, which agreed to buy Noble Energy in July in a $13bn transaction, Conoco is taking advantage of its relatively strong balance sheet to hoover up bargains. An oil price that has stabilised at about $40 a barrel should make the case even more compelling for investors.
Conoco's offer — at around $49.30 a share — is a mere 15 per cent premium to Concho's closing price on October 13, before news of the deal talks surfaced. In return, it is buying one of the biggest shale operators in the Permian Basin. The acquisition will immediately catapult Conoco to the number three spot in US shale production. Its expected 2020 output of 465,000 barrels per day will surpass Occidental's and put it just behind Chevron and EOG Resources, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Concho, whose shares were trading at $158 just two years ago, has little net debt — its $3.6bn is around 1.3 times expected ebitda for this year. Another attraction: few of Concho's wells are on federal lands. This could become an significant advantage if Joe Biden wins the US presidency in November and follows through with his proposal to ban new fracking permits on government land.
Taxed and capitalised, the $500m of annual cost savings forecast by Conoco are worth as much as $4bn. That is about 40 per cent the equity value of the deal, suggesting that Conoco has got a great price. For Conoco investors, the main downside is they will have to wait a little bit longer for share buybacks to restart. The company said that its stock repurchase programme will remain suspended until the first quarter of next year, when it expects the Concho deal to close. Judging by the muted reaction of Conoco shares when the announcement was made, investors clearly believe that it will pay to wait."

""Today's transaction is an affirmation of our commitment to lead a structural change for our vital industry,"" said Ryan Lance, Conoco chief executive. ""Together, ConocoPhillips and Concho will have unmatched scale and quality across the important value drivers in our business.""
Under the all-share transaction, Concho investors will receive 1.46 shares of Conoco stock for each of their own, a 15 per cent premium to closing share prices on October 13. Conoco said the combined group would have an enterprise value of $60bn. Concho chief executive Tim Leach would join the Conoco board.
The deal is the third big acquisition in the shale patch since the pandemic. Chevron agreed to buy Noble Energy in July in a $13bn transaction, while Devon Energy last month agreed to take over rival WPX for $12bn.
The Conoco deal follows months of brutal cost-cutting and bankruptcies in the US oil patch, where production has fallen from a record near 13m barrels a day to about 11m b/d. Analysts said Conoco's move showed that big oil groups were ready to use the crash, which has driven asset valuations to multiyear lows, to build scale in shale.
""ConocoPhillips is adding enough Permian production to nip at the heels of ExxonMobil's massive programme,"" said Robert Clarke, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Conoco said the combined companies would hold a resource base of 23bn barrels of oil equivalent with an average supply cost of less than $30 a barrel, and would produce 1.5m barrels of oil and gas a day.
The group's operations include assets in Australia, Asia-Pacific and Canada. Its production from the Permian shale in Texas and New Mexico was less than 100,000 b/d last year.
Concho produced just over 330,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day last year. In a sector that became notorious in recent years for its failure to generate profits or return capital, it was considered one of the better performers. Ian Nieboer, head of oil research at Enverus, said it offered ""quality assets, sufficient scale and an inventory of rich areas to be drilled"". Lex page 20

| Jump to first hitConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for about US$9.7 billion in stock, the largest shale industry deal since the collapse in energy demand earlier this year and one that will create a heavyweight driller in America's most prolific oilfield.
Investors will get 1.46 Conoco shares for each Concho share, the companies said Monday in a statement. The transaction represents a 15 per cent premium over Concho's closing price on Oct. 13, the last trading session before Bloomberg News first reported the companies were in talks.
The pandemic-induced price crash and lacklustre global economic recovery have accelerated the push for consolidation across the shale patch, which is under severe financial strain after years of debt-fuelled growth.
The combination of Conoco and Concho will be one of the dominant operators in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, rivalling only the likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. in terms of crude output.
The deal may also signal further mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Despite a compelling rationale for more consolidation in order to cut costs, a lack of cash and Wall Street's antipathy toward the sector has, until recently, made it hard to get deals across the line.
But with oil stable at around US$40 a barrel, there are signs that M&A is now gaining momentum. Chevron Corp. completed its acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. in early October, and in late September Devon Energy Corp. announced it was buying Permian operator WPX Energy Inc. Unlike some shale deals in 2019, Devon's tie-up with WPX was well-received, with both companies agreeing on a small deal premium. That follows investor criticism of some deal premiums last year for being excessive.
The Concho takeover is Conoco's biggest under its current chief executive, Ryan Lance, who until now has sought to position the company almost as an anti-shale option for Wall Street, touting little-to-no-growth, steady cash flow and disciplined spending.
While Lance has made no secret of his desire to take advantage of the downturn to expand in shale, he said in July that any transaction must meet Conoco's criteria of having a low cost of supply while being able to compete with the rest of the company's portfolio.
Houston-based Conoco emerged from the oil market slump in a relatively strong position with about US$7 billion of cash on hand. It recently resumed share buybacks.
But its growth outlook is challenged: second-quarter production was down by almost 25 per cent from a year earlier after it joined many other U.S. drillers in curbing output in response to lower prices.
Conoco and Concho said on a conference call that the deal didn't arise from a need to fix anything but rather a desire to bulk up.
""Evaluating the go-forward size and scale really becomes more and more important,"" Concho CEO Tim Leach, who will be executive vice-president and president of the merged companies'operations in the lower 48 U.S. states, said on the call. ""The 'why now'is that we have common vision on this, and creating a company that can attract capital and be a leader in that regard is the compelling reason why we wanted to move now.""
Adding Concho will dramatically alter Conoco's production profile. The Midland, Texas-based shale company is entirely focused on the Permian and pumped 319,000 barrels in the second quarter, about six times what Conoco produced there.
The combination will save US$500 million a year by 2022, and hand shareholders more than 30 per cent of cash from operations through dividends and other distributions, the companies said.
Concho ""was an attractive company and had one of the deepest tier 1 resource bases in shale,"" analysts at Wells Fargo said in a note. With a deal premium of 15 per cent along with the projected efficiencies, Conoco ""seems to be getting a bargain.""
Though the transaction may be good for shareholders, the extensive cost cuts mean it's unlikely to benefit already declining U.S. oil production, or the companies like Halliburton Co. who provide drilling and other services. Halliburton said Monday that business outside the U.S. is still weak.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is Conoco's financial adviser on the deal and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is its legal adviser. Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are Concho's financial advisers and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is its legal adviser.
Concho's shares rose 0.14 per cent to US$48.67 as of early afternoon trading in New York while Conoco's dropped 0.7 per cent to US$33.54.

ConocoPhillips has agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion in what would be the largest U.S. oil deal since the coronavirus pandemic began roiling global energy markets.
The acquisition gives ConocoPhillips, the largest oil producer in Alaska, a much larger footprint in the hottest oil field in the U.S., the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The combined company would be the largest U.S. oil independent, with output in the Permian second only to Occidental Petroleum Corp., according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis of Enverus data.
""Sector consolidation is both necessary and inevitable,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts Monday. ""We both believe our industry needs solutions that address the lack of scale, poor returns and, increasingly, the challenges and opportunities of environmental, social and governance matters.""
The all-stock acquisition values Concho at a 15% premium to its closing price on Oct. 13 and would give shareholders 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips stock for each share of Concho common stock. Bloomberg News reported the companies were close to a deal last week.
It is the latest in a series of combinations in the U.S. oil patch, where companies are seeking to bulk up to ride out weak demand and low prices, which have hovered around $40 a barrel since June, below the level many companies require to make money on new shale wells.
Devon Energy Corp. agreed last month to a $2.6 billion merger with WPX Energy Inc., while Chevron Corp. agreed in July to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion. Both were all-stock deals.
""Scale has never been more important. Through this transaction, we're joining Concho with a larger diversified energy company with even more size and resources to create value in today's markets and beyond,"" Concho CEO Tim Leach said Monday. He is set to join the combined company as an executive vice president and board member.
It has been a brutal year for U.S. oil companies, which are suffering from prolonged weak demand for fossil fuels during the pandemic. The companies had already been facing investor flight after failing to generate consistent returns, even as they helped lift American oil production to world-leading totals.
As of Friday, the value of Concho's shares had fallen roughly 25% in a year, as the S&P 500 index rose about 17%. Both companies' shares fell about 3% Monday while U.S. benchmark oil prices were relatively flat, settling near $41 a barrel.
In a sign of the shale industry's problems, Concho is selling itself for little more than the roughly $8 billion it paid two years ago to acquire RSP Permian Inc. Later, in the first quarter of this year, the company wrote down the value of its oil and natural-gas assets by $12.6 billion, one of the largest recent impairments by an oil and gas producer.
The deal marks a strategic departure for ConocoPhillips, which has spent years shedding assets even as peers chased aggressive growth. Adding Concho, which drills exclusively in the Permian, would give the company a far larger footprint in the nation's top oil basin.
For Concho, joining with a larger, more diversified rival would help alleviate one of the major challenges for shale companies: Their wells generate a lot of oil and gas early on, but that output trails off quickly. That leaves companies on a treadmill, consistently plowing money back into the ground simply to maintain output.
""The size and scale that we are today with an underlying decline rate that approaches 40%, it's hard to distribute cash back to the shareholders as rapidly as we can in this new model,"" Mr. Leach said, referring to the pace at which the company's production would decline in a year if it didn't invest in new wells.
Without producing new wells, the combined company's output would decline by less than 12% a year, ConocoPhillips said. Roughly half of the combined company's production would be in the Lower 48 states, with a further 15% coming from Alaska and the remaining 35% from international positions.
Mr. Lance said in an interview that ConocoPhillips has yet to set growth targets, but would seek to at least hold the combined production flat.
The company also intends to return more than 30% of its cash generated from operations to shareholders through regular dividends and other distributions, consistent with ConocoPhillips's current targets. Mr. Lance said those payouts help differentiate ConocoPhillips from other independent rivals.
ConocoPhillips said it expects the combined company to be able to trim costs by $500 million annually by 2022, thanks in part to lower administrative expenses and a reduction in its global exploration program.
The company also pledged to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations by 35% to 45% from 2016 levels by 2030, and eliminate them by 2050. Mr. Lance said the company supports government measures to put a price on carbon, which include such ideas as a carbon tax.
The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close early next year.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
When an industry is in a swoon, M&A tends to serve a defensive function for the hunter, the hunted, and often both. ConocoPhillips's $9.7 billion purchase of Concho Resources looks much more like an offensive strategy.
ConocoPhillips has agreed to acquire the smaller company in an all-stock transaction that values Concho at a modest 15% premium to its closing price on Oct. 13. Buyer's remorse seems unlikely for now: Analysts at RBC surveyed Conoco investors who would have been comfortable with a 20% premium.
If shareholders approve the deal, the combination would create the largest independent oil-and-gas company with an enterprise value of roughly $60 billion. The companies estimate that the combination would create synergies of about $500 million a year by 2022.
Times are tough in the business, but the combination isn't born out of desperation for either company. While shares of both have plummeted this year, both companies have outperformed a broad basket of oil-and-gas exploration stocks in the S&P 500 and have maintained their investment-grade status. Conoco has a $7 billion-plus cash position and recently announced a return to its share-buyback program. Notably, Conoco has long prized discipline over growth. The deal would be its largest purchase since 2005, according to a report from Pavel Molchanov, analyst at Raymond James.
Concho's shareholders have reasons to be excited. The merger would reduce the company's leverage and give it access to Conoco's more generous dividend policy. For Conoco shareholders, Concho brings attractive shale economics: Its 2021 free cash flow break-even point is below $30 a barrel, while Conoco's is just below $35 a barrel, according to RBC. The deal looks like an offensive strategy for another reason: In a departure from U.S. peers, the combined company announced a target to reach net-zero emissions from operations by 2050. The move could be a key differentiator for the combined company in an investment climate that has seen big institutions dump the industry to meet environmental mandates.
At a time when European peers are doubling down on green goals and U.S. peers have mainly focused on shareholder returns, straddling both could differentiate the enlarged company.

When an industry is in a swoon, M&A tends to serve a defensive function for the hunter, the hunted, and often both. ConocoPhillips's $9.7 billion purchase of Concho Resources looks much more like an offensive strategy.
ConocoPhillips has agreed to acquire the smaller company in an all-stock transaction that values Concho at a relatively modest 15% premium to its closing price on Oct. 13, before deal rumors surfaced. That is in keeping with recent tie-ups in the industry that have commanded small premiums. Buyer's remorse seems unlikely for now: Analysts at RBC surveyed Conoco investors who would have been comfortable with a premium of 20%.
If shareholders approve the deal, the combination would create the largest independent oil-and-gas company with an enterprise value of roughly $60 billion. The companies estimate that the combination would create synergies of about $500 million a year by 2022.
Times are tough in the business, but the combination isn't born out of desperation for either company. While shares of both have plummeted this year with the Covid-19-induced drop in oil prices, both companies have outperformed a broad basket of oil-and-gas exploration stocks in the S&P 500 and have maintained their investment-grade status. Conoco has a $7 billion-plus cash position and recently announced a return to its share-buyback program. Notably, Conoco has long prized discipline over growth .

ConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources on Monday for $9.7 billion in stock, making it the largest oil and gas deal since the pandemic began. If approved, the combined company would become the largest independent producer of oil and gas in the country by far.
The stocks weren't moving much in early trading, probably because the
merger news surfaced in a report last week
and the price came in line with what many analysts had been expecting. Conoco (ticker: COP) was trading flat and Concho (CXO) rose 0.3% in early trading, to $48.74—close to the implied deal price. That indicates that investors don't expect another company to come in and try to offer a higher price.
The deal gives Concho investors only a slight bump—it values the company at $49.30 based on Friday's closing price, a 15% premium to its closing price the day before the merger talks first leaked, but a 47% discount to its 52-week high. (Because it's an all-stock deal, those numbers could change as stock prices change.)
The initial report about the deal last week did not specify a price, but analysts had assumed it would be a modest premium. Analyst Paul Sankey wrote that investors were expecting a midteens premium, which is what they got.
Concho is attractive to Conoco because Concho owns premium land in the Permian Basin, an oil-rich area in Texas and New Mexico that has become the most productive oil basin in the United States.
""The key to Conoco-Concho, is that it is not
a consolidate-and-cut-costs move of the kind we suggested
for Chevron (CVX)-Exxon Mobil (XOM),"" Sankey wrote. ""This is an expansionary move by Conoco, into what was widely seen as their most likely play for growth at the bottom of the cycle, the Permian.""
That said, Conoco is projecting to the market that it is more interested in safety and steady returns than in fast growth.
In a presentation that accompanied the deal announcement, Conoco pledged to focus on annual dividend growth. Indeed, the dividend and balance sheet were mentioned in the company's first three priorities. Right now, Conoco's dividend yield is 5% and Concho's is 1.6%.
The deal is a signal that energy mergers and acquisitions are heating up. Investors have mostly been negative on M&A, because of value-killing deals like Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year. But the latest wave has been different. Chevron's deal to buy Noble Energy and Devon Energy's (DVN) agreement to merge with WPX Energy (WPX) were both all-stock transactions. The companies are not taking on debt, and the premiums have been modest. That's a good sign for investors who grew tired of debt-fueled deals that didn't improve the cash flow of the acquirers.
Truist analyst Neal Dingmann thinks the news ""is likely to push peers to reconsider their future strategies in order to better compete in today's new energy environment,"" he wrote. ""In our opinion, a key to the COP/CXO is the deal consists mostly of equity enabling holders of the combined company to benefit from future upside synergies/scale, offsetting some downside from CXO shares in past months.
""Given recently announced M&A deals, we believe E&Ps within our coverage that could potentially look to transact include Cimarex Energy (XEC), Parsley Energy (PE), Whiting Petroleum (WLL), Matador Resources (MTDR), and QEP Resources (QEP) among others, based on attributes such as their attractive asset bases and/or strong balance sheets, among other things,"" he added.

ConocoPhillips has agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion in what would be the largest U.S. oil deal since the coronavirus pandemic began roiling global energy markets.
The acquisition gives ConocoPhillips, the largest oil producer in Alaska, a much larger footprint in the hottest oil field in the U.S., the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico . The combined company would be the largest U.S. oil independent, with output in the Permian second only to Occidental Petroleum Corp., according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysis of Enverus data.
""Sector consolidation is both necessary and inevitable,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts Monday after the announcement. ""We both believe our industry needs solutions that address the lack of scale, poor returns and, increasingly, the challenges and opportunities of environmental, social and governance matters.""
Oil sector's response to coronavirus
The all-stock acquisition values Concho at a 15% premium to its closing price on Oct. 13 and would give shareholders 1.46 shares of ConocoPhillips stock for each share of Concho common stock. Bloomberg News reported the companies were close to a deal last week.
It is the latest in a series of combinations in the U.S. oil patch, where companies are seeking to bulk up to ride out weak demand and low prices , which have hovered around $40 a barrel since June, below the level many companies require to make money on new shale wells.
Devon Energy Corp. agreed last month to a $2.6 billion merger with WPX Energy Inc., while Chevron Corp. agreed in July to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion . Both were all-stock deals.
""Scale has never been more important. Through this transaction, we're joining Concho with a larger diversified energy company with even more size and resources to create value in today's markets and beyond,"" Concho CEO Tim Leach said Monday. He is set to join the combined company as an executive vice president and board member.
It has been a brutal year for U.S. oil companies, which are suffering from prolonged weak demand for fossil fuels during the pandemic. The companies had already been facing investor flight after failing to generate consistent returns, even as they helped lift American oil production to world-leading totals.
As of Friday, the value of Concho's shares had fallen roughly 25% in a year, as the S&P 500 index rose about 17%. Both companies' shares fell about 3% Monday while U.S. benchmark oil prices were relatively flat, settling near $41 a barrel.
In a sign of the shale industry's problems, Concho is selling itself for little more than the roughly $8 billion it paid two years ago to acquire RSP Permian Inc. Later, in the first quarter of this year, the company wrote down the value of its oil and natural-gas assets by $12.6 billion, one of the largest recent impairments by an oil and gas producer.
The deal marks a strategic departure for ConocoPhillips, which has spent years shedding assets even as peers chased aggressive growth. Adding Concho, which drills exclusively in the Permian, would give the company a far larger footprint in the nation's top oil basin.
For Concho, joining with a larger, more diversified rival would help alleviate one of the major challenges for shale companies: Their wells generate a lot of oil and gas early on, but that output trails off quickly. That leaves companies on a treadmill , consistently plowing money back into the ground simply to maintain output.
""The size and scale that we are today with an underlying decline rate that approaches 40%, it's hard to distribute cash back to the shareholders as rapidly as we can in this new model,"" Mr. Leach said, referring to the pace at which the company's production would decline in a year if it didn't invest in new wells.
Without producing new wells, the combined company's output would decline by less than 12% a year, ConocoPhillips said. Roughly half of the combined firm's production would be in the Lower 48 states, with a further 15% coming from Alaska and the remaining 35% from international positions.
Mr. Lance said in an interview that ConocoPhillips has yet to set growth targets, but would seek to at least hold the combined company's production flat.
The company also intends to return more than 30% of its cash generated from operations to shareholders through regular dividends and other distributions, consistent with ConocoPhillips's current targets. Mr. Lance said those payouts help differentiate ConocoPhillips from other independent rivals.
""You've got to deliver financial returns in this business,"" he said.
ConocoPhillips said it expects the combined company to be able to trim costs by $500 million annually by 2022, thanks in part to lower administrative expenses and a reduction in its global exploration program.
The company also pledged to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations by 35% to 45% from 2016 levels by 2030, and eliminate them by 2050. That doesn't include the emissions generated when consumers use fossil fuels, such as by burning a gallon of gasoline. To address those releases, Mr. Lance said the company supports government measures to put a price on carbon, which include such ideas as a carbon tax.
The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, is expected to close early next year.

| Jump to first hitConocoPhillips is in talks to acquire rival Concho Resources Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, as one of America's largest independent oil explorers looks to make a bold bet on shale during a historic industry downturn.
The companies may announce a deal in the next few weeks, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the matter isn't public. Concho shares climbed as much as 15 per cent in New York trading Wednesday, the most since April.
Conoco shares fell 1 per cent Wednesday to US$34.53, translating into a market value of about US$37 billion. No final decision has been made and talks could fall through, the people said. Representatives for Conoco and Concho didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The potential combination would be the latest sign that long-expected consolidation in the shale patch has finally arrived. A purchase of Concho, which has an enterprise value of US$13.4 billion, could become the year's largest takeover of an oil and gas company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It would likely surpass Chevron Corp.'s all-stock acquisition of Noble Energy Inc., which was valued at about US$11.8 billion including debt when it closed in October.
It would follow Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s US$38 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. last year and could come just weeks after a US$2.6 billion merger of Devon Energy Corp. and WPX Energy Inc. A transaction would also continue a trend of explorers seeking to bulk up specifically in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most productive field in the U.S.
Conoco has been dropping hints about a potential M&A deal for months. In July, chief executive Ryan Lance said the company was encouraged by the low premiums needed for acquisitions in the shale sector, citing Chevron's deal to buy Noble.
""We're looking at asset deals, we're looking at corporate deals, we look across the board,"" he said at the time.
Concho has drilling rights on about 800,000 gross acres in the Permian, according to a September investor presentation. While Houston-based Conoco has lost nearly half its market value this year, it's held up relatively well compared to peers as oil prices collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic.
A deal between the two companies would make ""strategic and financial sense,"" JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Phil Gresh wrote in a note Wednesday, adding that acquiring Concho would be accretive on most metrics and provide ""critical mass"" to Conoco's position in the Permian."

ConocoPhillips, the country's largest independent oil producer, is in talks to buy Concho Resources, a large oil producer in the Permian Basin,
according to a report
late Tuesday.
The report by Bloomberg sent Concho stock (ticker: CXO) 13% higher Wednesday morning, although Bloomberg didn't report on the potential price that Conoco (COP) is willing to pay. Conoco, whose stock was up 1.7%, wouldn't comment on what it called market rumors and Concho didn't respond to a request for comment.
But as market rumors go, this one isn't particularly surprising. ConocoPhillips has hinted for months that it was looking to do a deal. Investors in oil-and-gas stocks have been against deals for more than a year because some recent ones haven't worked out well. But that may be starting to change.
Chevron just
completed an acquisition
of Noble Energy and producers Devon Energy (DVN) and WPX Energy (WPX) have also
announced merger plans
. Those deals were all-stock transactions and were done without much of a buyout premium—the lack of new debt makes them more attractive to investors. In addition, oil prices have been stuck in a rut and consolidation makes more sense than it did before the pandemic. At $40 oil prices few producers
can maintain their current operations
and expect to make money in the long-term. But acquisitions allow companies to cut costs and become more efficient.
Conoco has positioned itself smartly for an acquisition. Instead of spending too heavily when oil rebounded after 2016, it kept its powder dry and now has a strong enough balance sheet to do a deal without risking serious debt trouble.
Conoco ""has been counter-cyclical, aggressively selling assets from 2016 onwards with some spectacular successes such as the 2017 Cenovus disposition that was so wildly in favor of ConocoPhillips that it essentially cost the entire Cenovus management team their jobs,"" wrote analyst Paul Saney of Sankey Research. ""In short, the company finds itself with the financial firepower to do a deal for a high quality Permian play. At face value ConocoPhillips' multiple is higher than Concho's and its balance sheet can handle the debt. The question now, is the price.""
Other analysts also see the potential deal as a smart one, because it would bolster Conoco in the Permian, the most productive U.S. oil basin.
""Strategically, Concho would provide critical mass to ConocoPhillips' position in the Permian Basin, where investors have often cited its subscale position as a longer term area of concern,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh wrote. ""Further, it would increase ConocoPhillips' optionality around the pace of its investments in the US, Canada and Alaska (ConocoPhillips' key regions of planned investment).""
For Concho, making a deal now could be a smart move, because the company faces regulatory uncertainty. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has proposed banning new oil-and-gas drilling on federal lands, and about 20% of Concho's acreage is on federal property, according to Gresh.
There is ample reason to think that the M&A wave isn't over yet. If companies can pull off all-stock deals with relatively small premiums, they can bolster their businesses ahead of what could be a long period of mediocre oil prices. Truist analyst Neal Dingmann thinks other names could be targets too.
""Within our coverage, similar to Concho, we think there could be other potentially attractive targets given their strong asset bases and solid balance sheets including Cimarex (XEC), Parsley (PE), and others,"" he wrote. Both of those names were up more than 4% Wednesday morning, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose a fraction.

Texas oil producer Concho Resources is in a strong position to persevere through the Covid-19 crisis, and could even be a takeout candidate, says SunTrust Robinson Humphreys analyst Neal Dingmann in upgrading its shares to Buy.
Concho (ticker: CXO) cut its capital expenditures by about 50% but is still likely to produce about the same number of barrels of oil -- 200,000 a dayday—as it did in 2019, Dingmann notes.
And the stock is trading at a 15% to 25% valuation discount to its peers.
""Concho also has a surprising in line valuation as its stock has been outperformed by nearly all peers since the beginning of the second quarter,"" Dingmann writes.
In addition, Concho's balance sheet
can weather an extended downturn
.
""Concho has among the lowest leverage with no debt coming due until 2025,"" Dingmann wrote. ""The company continues to enjoy some of the best hedges well into 2021 assuming oil prices remain range bound as we project.""
Concho drills about 15% of its wells on federal land making it somewhat exposed to a possible ban on new federal drilling, which has been proposed by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. But Dingmann writes that Concho has considerable acreage on private land that will keep it insulated from a change in the law.
And Concho, a $10 billion market-cap company, has a wild card. Dingmann thinks the company could get bought by a larger operator. Chevron announced the first big oil and gas deal of the pandemic era last week when it said it was buying Noble Energy (NBL).
While
some analysts believe that the Chevron purchase is unlikely to kick off a larger wave of M&A
, Dingmann thinks Concho could be ""a premier takeover candidate"" because of its low valuation and strong debt profile.
He thinks shares could rise to $66. The stock was down 0.7%, on Tuesday to $52.32.

Texas shale driller Concho Resources Inc. reported a net quarterly loss of $9.3 billion Thursday and wrote down the value of its oil and gas assets by $12.6 billion, a sign of the severe stress U.S. oil and gas companies are feeling as demand for their products erodes.
Concho, a Midland, Texas-based producer with a market capitalization of about $11 billion, attributed the impairment to a steep decline in oil and gas prices and market weakness due to the novel coronavirus.
U.S. benchmark oil closed around $19 a barrel Thursday, up from less than zero last week. Excluding the charges and other one-off items, the company said it generated quarterly profits of $142 million.
Concho's charge is one of the largest by an oil and gas producer in years, exceeding Chevron Corp.'s
write-down of more than $10 billion
last year.
It comes two years after Concho agreed to buy RSP Permian Inc.
for about $9.5 billion
. That deal valued RSP's assets at about $76,000 per acre, significantly higher than other deals in the Permian Basin oilfield of Texas and New Mexico around that time, which were for $40,000 an acre or less.
""We are managing through the volatility and uncertainty from a position of strength, which we are focused on maintaining by aligning our operations with current market realities,"" Concho Chief Executive Tim Leach said in a statement Thursday.
Concho said it plans to further reduce 2020 capital spending to about $1.6 billion, from the roughly $2.7 billion it forecast earlier in the year. The company expects production to remain relatively flat from 2019.
Concho's $9.3 billion quarterly loss compares with a loss of $695 million during the same period last year.

It hasn't been an easy year for energy stocks, particularly exploration-and-production companies. But Concho Resources has fallen harder than most. Now a former bull warns that more losses await, and the downgrade is sending the shares down more than 5% Tuesday.
The back story. The Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLE) has climbed less than 2% year to date, compared with the S&P 500's nearly 14% climb, but upstream companies have struggled even more, with the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) down 17.3% in 2019. Yet Concho (CXO) has tumbled almost 35% in the same time frame, and has lost more than 50% in the past 12 months.

The latest round of China tariffs isn't helping
the price of oil, which was
already languishing
. In addition, Concho's most
recent earnings report disappointed
, while the company also
wrote down the value
of its Permian Basin assets by some $900 million.
What's new. On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley analyst Drew Venker cut his rating on Concho by two notches, to Underweight from Overweight, and more than halved his price target, to $64 from $131.
Venker's earlier bullish estimates were too optimistic, he writes, especially in terms of oil output and natural gas pricing. He lowered his expectations for a number of metrics, including oil production, free cash flow, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and exploration expenses (Ebitdax), which reduce his price target and anchor his downgrade.
Looking ahead. Concho slid more than 20% after management slashed its full-year production guidance, which may make some investors think that all the bad news is already priced into the stock. Yet Venker argues that there are ""multiple challenges that could drive continued underperformance"" for Concho.
Venker writes that Ebitda and production estimates still have room to come down farther, while higher costs could lead to Concho overspending its initial 2019 budget. Moreover, given recent problems, he argues it will be difficult for the shares to retain its premium to peers—and that premium also leads him to believe there are better opportunities elsewhere in the sector.
Concho stock is down 5.2% to $66.61 in recent trading.

The energy sector was the only group of stocks in the S&P 500 in the red at midday on Thursday, with a decline of almost 1% versus a 0.9% rise for the broader index. Two main factors were to blame: A rising U.S. dollar and a gloomy earnings report from the Permian Basin's largest shale-energy producer.
The dollar rallied to its highest level against a basket of foreign currencies since early 2017 on Thursday morning, after the Federal Reserve took a
less accommodative stance
than expected on Wednesday. Expectations of higher relative interest rates in the U.S. versus abroad make the dollar more attractive for investors, lifting demand for the currency. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) remained up about 0.1% in the early afternoon.
It matters for oil and other commodities because they are priced in dollars when traded globally. A more valuable dollar means that a barrel of oil is worth fewer dollars, all else equal.
Futures on West Texas Intermediate crude were down 3.2% to $56.73, while Brent, the main international oil-price benchmark, fell 2.6% to $63.37. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (ticker: XLE) was down 0.96%. Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell 0.8%, while shares of Chevron (CVX), another giant energy company, were about flat.
Also not helping matters for oil-company stocks was an earnings report from Concho Resources (CXO), released Wednesday evening, that sent its stock down by more than 24% on Thursday. The U.S. oil and natural gas explorer and developer wrote down the value of its assets in the Permian Basin by almost $900 million.
That caused its second-quarter earnings to swing to a loss of 48 cents per share, while Wall Street had expected a profit of $1.12. Even after adjusting for the impairment charge, lower energy prices left Concho with its lowest quarterly EPS since 2017. The result was down 44% from a year earlier and again fell short of analysts' prior estimates.
Management warned that production will be lower in the second half of 2019.
The Concho news dragged down many other exploration and production players, including Diamondback Energy (FANG), which fell 6.6%; Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), down 6.4%; EOG Resources (EOG), down 4.9%; and Cimarex Energy (XEC), down 5.1%.

Concho Resources Inc. disclosed disappointing output from wells drilled close together, an emerging problem in the shale drilling industry, and its shares fell 22% on Thursday.
The company, one of the largest shale drillers in America's hottest oil field, the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, forecast that its production would likely decline in the third quarter, due in part to an experiment to pack wells closely together that wound up hurting output.
That, along with lower natural gas and natural gas-liquids prices, led the company to scale back this year's drilling plans to stay within budget.
""We made the decision to adjust our drilling and completion schedule in the second half of the year to slow down and not chase incremental production at the expense of capital discipline,"" Chief Executive Tim Leach told investors.
Another factor likely weighing on Concho's shares was a decline in the price of oil, which was down Thursday morning and fell further after President Trump announced a 10% tariff on some Chinese goods.
The Midland, Texas-based driller is one of several shale companies grappling with lower-than-expected output from wells it drilled too densely. Many shale companies sought to boost production by placing wells in proximity, but have since found that doing so often means the
wells produce less
as they draw down the same resource, as The Wall Street Journal
reported in March
.
These production challenges have come into focus as investors put intense pressure on companies to live within their means after years of struggling to make money.
Concho pointed to lackluster results from a 23-well development in the western portion of the
Permian
, where it tried cutting the distance between its wells by 50%.
""While initial rates were solid, current performance data indicates that we developed the Upper Wolfcamp too densely,"" Mr. Leach said, referring to a rock formation in the Permian. ""We're incorporating the data into our development model to adjust spacing on future projects.""
Other tightly spaced developments are set to begin producing later this year, the company said, but they are less dense than the 23-well project.
Concho is planning to bring fewer wells to production in the second half of the year, which will translate into reduced output. The company forecast third-quarter production of 316,000 to 322,000 barrels of oil and gas a day, down from 328,681 barrels a day in the second quarter. That translates into about 201,000 barrels of oil a day, according to company forecasts, down from 205,780 barrels a day during the second quarter.
""The magnitude of the miss will invariably raise capital efficiency concerns,"" JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note.
Concho reported a second-quarter loss of $97 million, down from $137 million in profit during the same period a year earlier and missing analyst expectations of profit totaling $142.6 million, according to FactSet.
That was due in part to
low natural gas prices
, which have weighed on shale drillers as they have struggled to get their gas to market due to insufficient pipeline and processing capacity. The company fetched an average of $1.16 per thousand cubic feet of gas, compared with $3.19 during the second quarter of 2018.

Concerns about shale have roared in recently like a Texas tornado—sudden and violent.
Permian Basin oil-and-gas driller Concho Resources posted a 25% drop in adjusted second-quarter earnings Wednesday night despite a year-over-year increase of more than 40% in oil and natural-gas volumes. The results sent Concho's shares plunging by over one-fifth on Thursday.
Concho wasn't alone: Whiting Petroleum's shares were off by more than one-third after a surprise quarterly loss. The results dragged down shares of other regional drillers including Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley Energy.
Oil and gas prices were lower in the quarter, which didn't help, but costs were the real culprit in Concho's disappointing results. They underscore challenges shale drilling poses for energy producers. At Concho, higher volumes helped push up total operating revenue by more than 19%. But extracting the oil using water and sand at high pressure is increasingly expensive. Total operating costs and expenses more than doubled in the second quarter.
Shareholders have become more sensitive to the cost side of the equation recently and have pressured drillers to rein in spending and to focus on returning cash.
It isn't working.
In the first quarter of this year a basket of seven unconventional oil-focused drillers collectively reported free cash flow of negative $1.58 billion, according to Wood Mackenzie—more than twice their free-cash-flow burn in the fourth quarter of 2018 and more than four times worse than during the first quarter of 2018.
Shale is uniquely problematic because of rapid production-decline rates and the constant need to reinvest. Other drilling, like deep-water, has high upfront costs but relatively modest ongoing investment.
True, other producers are less nimble than shale producers and are making more of an outright long-term bet on commodity prices, but investors seem to have rediscovered the charms of conventional-oil production. For example, Hess Corp, in a partnership with Exxon Mobil, has plunged into a big project in Guyana. Hess's return on invested capital has been negative since oil prices collapsed in 2014, yet its shares are suddenly in favor again, rising almost 60% so far this year.
Other Permian drillers such as Pioneer Natural Resources have started to
rethink their ambitious targets
and instead are slimming down operations. Conversely, big integrated oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil have raised their spending on shale while Occidental Petroleum has launched an ambitious deal for Anadarko Petroleum to plunge further into the area.
The wisdom of those bets will take years to dissect, but for now the wind suddenly seems to be blowing the wrong way.

| Jump to first hit Genesis Digital Assets Limited (GDA), one of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the world in terms of hash rate, has announced the opening of a new data centre in Argentina powered by YPF Luz, a leading company in electric power generation. The announcement comes during a period of expansion by GDA, which now operates 20 industrial-scale data centres across North America, South America, Europe, and Central Asia. The company’s first facility in South America is located in Rincón de Los Sauces, in the Neuquén Province and has a total capacity of 7 MW and 1 MW of backup. The Bajo del Toro Thermal Power Plant, composed of YPF, Equinor and YPF Luz, will power 1,200 bitcoin mining machines, and efficiently monetize stranded gas, which would otherwise be flared into the atmosphere. Speaking from the company’s Dubai office today, Abdumalik Mirakhmedov, Executive President of GDA, said: “We believe that Argentina is an important country for Bitcoin mining, given its abundance of energy sources and business-friendly environment. “The opening of our first data center in South America is an important step in our geographic diversification efforts. And this will be yet another opportunity to show the world that Bitcoin mining can have a positive effect on the environment and can be fully integrated into local communities. ”With an abundance of energy, a favourable political climate, and a strong crypto ethos, Argentina is becoming increasingly important for Bitcoin mining and the broader industry. For the new data center, GDA will use the electricity generated from stranded gas provided YPF Luz, an electric power generation company that has been leading the energy transition since 2013. As stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane gas adversely impacts the environment as it is responsible for approximately a third of the warming the world is experiencing. Methane mitigation techniques, such as the utilization of stranded gas, are important to reduce emissions and combat global warming. As stated in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology working paper, Bitcoin mining could potentially reduce between 25% and 63% of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions by repurposing methane gas. “In 2022, we were the first Argentine company to generate electrical energy for cryptocurrency mining from flare gas, an innovative solution in line with YPF's energy transition needs,” said Martín Mandarano, CEO of YPF Luz. “This project with GDA allows us to bring YPF and Equinor, two companies committed to reducing the carbon footprint of their exploration activities, an adaptable and sustainable flare gas use solution. ” - TradeArabia News Service"

| Jump to first hitEnvironment Energy companies work in a twilight industry where demand still endures. They don't know the answers to the questions that investor activists ask.
Environmental activism used to be a David and Goliath struggle. Underdogs combining stunt-based performance art with ideology to challenge the power of big government and business.
They were plucky, tactical attention seekers, demanding simple solutions to complex problems to draw attention to the issue at hand and galvanise grass-roots support. Success was measured in awareness, not outcomes.
Abseiling down buildings or chaining yourself to the doors of corporate offices is so 20th century.
The new activists are loaded, often bigger and more powerful than their targets, leveraging billions of dollars of other people's money to harass a careful selection of corporates.
Woodside was the latest target of this updated symbolism-over-substance model. A posse of pension and investment funds staged a media-centric star chamber at its AGM last week. Woodside's board and management were charged with vague but self-important charge of not doing enough on climate change.
It was a confected outrage. Woodside hadn't broken any laws or breached any fiduciary standards. The trigger for the pile-on was that some pension fund investors thought Woodside's climate action plan wasn't ambitious enough.
It's a subjective criticism to a question to which Woodside, and all other fossil fuel producers, doesn't know the long-term answer that these investors demand.
Conventional energy companies operate in a twilight industry, but demand endures without any endpoint in sight.
Unlike renewables or nuclear in electricity, there is no scalable zero emissions substitute for gas in most industrial applications. Electricity systems will need deeper and more liquid gas markets to support the transition to renewables.
A new paper by economists Paul Simshauser and Joel Gilmore modelled what Australian electricity markets will need to replace the capacity of the 18 remaining coal generators, the big next step towards decarbonisation.
Even with continued scale-up of renewables, more batteries and pumped hydro, a future renewables grid will need a significant increase in gas generation and supply to get it through periods of low renewable generation, mostly in winter.
This would require a significant scale-up of gas peaking capacity supported by expanded gas transmission and/or storage, basically to ensure there is always enough energy to replace the massive volumes currently supplied by coal.
Worryingly, gas supplies in southern Australia are drying up. Official forecasts predict increased risk of winter gas shortages from 2025 as production tails off. Over the next decade Australia will need more new gas, not less.
At a strategic level, the increased role of gas in supporting a renewables-based electricity system is probably similar for many other economies attempting the same model. This is what gas as a transition fuel means. That global emissions decrease while gas production increases, as the combination of renewables, storage and gas replace high emissions coal.
That's only an interim solution, with hopes that hydrogen or its derivatives can be developed to replace the role of gas in the same way that nuclear or renewables can replace coal.
The pension fund activists haven't proposed any solutions to Woodside's climate planning because, at least in the short run, there aren't any except to cut production. This wouldn't reduce global emissions, just shift supply to other gas exporters.
For all its hype, the super fund campaign was largely symbolic. Their highly publicised vote down of Woodside's climate plan is not binding on the company, and chairman Richard Goyder survived the vote against him.
The media attention has been great for the environmental brand of participating funds, helping to sign up new members or investors.
This is a fine line for investors to walk, because in this and other cases the two objectives are in conflict.
Shutting down new projects or imposing additional environmental requirements cuts revenues or adds additional costs, wiping value from the businesses they have invested in.
Consciously losing investors' money to make a point about climate change is a dangerous game. It's unclear that these funds have a genuine mandate from members to weaponise their retirement funds in this way. They can talk tough so long as they don't go too far.
The focus now moves to Norway, where a new group of pension funds is protesting against the lack of ambition being shown by Equinor, the majority state-owned Norwegian oil and gas business that has underpinned that countries' aggressive investment in decarbonisation technologies from renewables to electric cars.
Equinor's switch from hero to villain reflects how subjective these new activist campaigns have become, in who is targeted and the demands made of them.
Even with money at their disposal, the binary colours of the activist palate are no longer sufficient in a world that has moved past the symbolism of protest to the pragmatism needed to solve complex problems.
Despite the protests, Woodside will keep developing its gas projects because Australia and the rest of the world still need its gas.
That's good for Australia because we need the revenue to help governments underwrite the $300 billion rebuild of our energy systems.

Since discovering large volumes of offshore gas, Tanzania has initiated plans to become a major LNG exporter. The country’s flagship Tanzania LNG project – set to process gas from fields operated by Equinor, Shell and ExxonMobil, producing 10 million metric tonnes per year – is awaiting the signing of a host government agreement that would enable the start of development. Shell’s Blocks 1 and 4 have an estimated 16 tcf of gas in place, while Equinor’s Block 2 has yielded nine discoveries with more than 20 tcf of estimated reserves.

| Jump to first hitEXCLUSIVE: Mike Hughes hears the inside story of bp’s remarkable £4bn investment in the region from Ian Hunter, managing director of NZT Power.
It was one of the biggest ‘gamechangers’ the region has ever seen - just a few days ago, bp’s Net Zero Teesside Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership chose their key specialist contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction projects on Teesside with a combined value of around £4billion.
Announcing the contractors across eight packages is a major milestone and gives a much-needed confirmation of plans and job projections which had been possible targets and now seem to be confirmed parts of the timeline.
Ian Hunter, as managing director of NZT Power, has been piloting the whole project since it was just two people having a ‘what if’ conversation in a bp office.
* The full bp announcement
Now - subject to regulatory clearances and FIDs (Final Investment Decisions) around September - this joint venture between bp and Equinor is a full-scale gas fired-power station fully ‎integrated with carbon capture.
Through a network of pipes that stretch around Teesside, NEP’s Teesside facilities will gather and compress ‎CO2 from NZT Power and other customers and export it offshore for permanent storage in the undersea Endurance aquifer.
Remediation work continues at Teesworks
It’s difficult to get your head around the sheer scale of it all, but since the first time we met, Ian has been determined to distil it down to the local implications - jobs, skills and global attention.
On a visit to the Teesworks site, he told me: “We’ve been working hard over the past couple of years to make sure we were attracting companies from the local supply chains – and we’ve already had supplier events where we have been talking to 500 companies.
“But the big announcement that we’ve selected Liberty Steel to provide a significant amount of the steel for the pipeline is great news for them and great news for the UK because of the longevity of this sort of project.
“A big part of what we’re trying to do is help people come into the low carbon sector, so that means getting into the schools and inspiring young people to do technology and engineering, creating new apprenticeships and graduate roles, as well as helping older experienced workers to retrain.”
Press releases aside, you have to sit in front of people like Ian and see the emotion and commitment as they outline their plans, knowing the way it will change lives.
“Personally, it’s been an incredible journey,” he admits.
“We’ve gone from two people in a room pitching ideas through to the involvement now with companies, local authorities and the Government - they have all supported us so much on this.
“We have had support across business and the political spectrum, now what you find in Teesside is when you ask people what they think about the project, what they really want to know about is the jobs - just what are the opportunities here?
bp's Teesworks site
“So it tends to be a very positive story and if you look at the technology we’re developing here, we’re really putting Teesside on the map globally. This power station with carbon capture will be the first of its kind anywhere in the world.”
As bp and the partner companies it has now named gear up for the work ahead, NZT and all of its associated threads have become a cluster.
Someone has to take the first step to make that happen and thankfully for Teesside, bp saw the potential and made the move.
“It’s hard to overemphasise the importance of getting the first projects started,” said Ian.
“Once you’ve got one under construction, it gives a massive boost in investor confidence and attracts more companies to come here and invest and make sure that those construction jobs can work on projects like Net Teesside Power and the Northern Endurance Partnership.
“For all the partners, including bp, it’s very consistent with the strategy that we set out in terms of developing such projects in the UK and more widely overseas. So this is certainly a flagship project for the partners, but it’s hopefully the beginning of a growing industry that we will see elsewhere in the world.
“Each of these milestones can be challenging individually.
Ben Houchen and Ian Hunter at Teesworks
“But as you overcome each one, you get this growing sense of confidence that we’re going to make it to the FID and get construction underway which is when you’ll see the real benefits in terms of jobs and supply chain involvement – they will really take off.
“Then we will tap into the wealth of skills that we’ve got locally.
“That means the whole range of construction trades through the construction period, but after the projects start operating, you will then get ongoing operations and maintenance type roles that will last for generations.”
bp’s big three
Net Zero Teesside Power
One of the world’s first commercial-scale gas fired power stations with carbon capture technology could generate up to 860 megawatts of low carbon electricity, enough to power the equivalent of up to 1.3m homes per year, close to 5% of all homes in the UK. A joint venture between bp and Equinor, with bp leading as operator.
H2Teesside

| Jump to first hitThe biggest single investment in Teesside industry in generations has been hailed as a ‘transformational’ moment for jobs and the region's ambition to be a global capital for green energy and innovation.
bp's Net Zero Teesside Power (NZT Power) and the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) have selected contractors for engineering, procurement, and construction projects with a combined value of around £4billion.
The selection of nine leading specialist contractors across eight contract packages is a major milestone for the Teesside-based projects, which would contribute to the UK’s journey towards net zero emissions by 2050.
This would be the single biggest investment in Teesside since ICI.
Hartlepool-based Liberty Steel is among the companies selected with NZT and NEP adding the investment represents a significant opportunity for both the local and UK supply chain.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “We are delivering the highly-skilled well-paid jobs of the future as part of these world-leading developments that have established our area as a world-leading centre in the clean, green industries of the future.

Power station plans take further step forward
Tees Valley is leading the charge on hydrogen fuel, says Minister
Ian Hunter, Managing Director, Net Zero Teesside Power, said: “The selection of contractors is a major step forward for Net Zero Teesside Power. We have selected world-class partners who have the experience and capability needed to deliver. We aim to take final investment decision in September 2024 or before, after which we’d look forward to working with our EPC partners through the construction phase”.
Chris Daykin, General Manager, Northern Endurance Partnership, said: “The selection of contractors is a clear signal of momentum within the East Coast Cluster. The Northern Endurance Partnership’s CO2 pipelines are essential to connect carbon intensive projects to offshore storage and would play an important role in helping the region pursue its net zero plan”.
Extensive work to clear and prepare the former Redcar Blast Furnace site by Teesworks Ltd ahead of construction of NZT Power is continuing after commencing in 2023.
Teesworks chairman Chris Musgrave said: “This is another major milestone and shows the massive impact Teesworks is bringing to the local economy in terms of jobs and investment.
“We’ve worked hard to prepare the site and now the contractors have been selected, it means we are moving forward at pace on this transformational project.
“Net Zero Teesside Power is a key part our green energy drive, feeding into the net zero ambitions of existing businesses and becoming a prime asset for others looking to relocate here. This shows the speed at which we’re moving for the good of local people and the region.”
Siobhan McArdle, Tees Valley Business Board, chair, said: “This is outstanding news for the region and delivers huge opportunities for our supply chains and local businesses. We are working closely with businesses of all sizes to develop and deliver the packages of support and skills development programmes they need so that they capitalise on the opportunities that come from this and other projects.
""Businesses unsure about the opportunities that exist across the Tees Valley, both immediate and in the pipeline, should contact the Business Board directly for support and guidance. ”
NZT Power – led by partners bp and Equinor at Teesworks – last month received planning approval by the Secretary of State after a detailed process lasting more than two years.

NZT Power aims to be the world’s first gas-fired power station with carbon capture and storage capability and will help drive Teesside’s aim to become the UK’s first decarbonised industrial cluster as early as 2030.
The project could create and support up to 4,000 jobs during construction and operations and add up to £300million to the economy per year.
The proposed power station will generate up to 860 megawatts of low carbon electricity – enough to power up to 1.3 million UK homes. Up to two million tonnes of CO2 emissions from the power station will be captured each year – emissions which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere.
The captured CO2 will then be transported by the Northern Endurance Partnership (NEP) by pipeline to a geological storage site under the North Sea, where it will be permanently and safely stored.
The final award of contracts is subject to the receipt of relevant regulatory clearances and positive Final Investment Decisions (FID) by the projects and UK government, planned for September 2024 or earlier. Following FID, the projects would be aiming for first commercial operations from 2027."

This Wednesday (06/03), the Mataripe Refinery won the direct sales process carried out by the company to sell a load of 500 thousand barrels. The shipment comes from the Atapu production sharing contract and will be available in April.For minister Alexandre Silveira, the sale of this cargo represents progress for the state-owned company and the beginning of a promising future for the company. ""PPSA plays a very important role in marketing our oil produced in the pre-salt. This is a very important step forward in adding value to the Union's oil. Increasingly, we are no longer exporters of commodities and are becoming the country that treats its raw materials, transforming them into something with high added value. This applies to petroleum-derived fuels, but also to biofuels. Our country is reindustrializing and generating jobs and income for the population"", highlighted Silveira.All companies already operating in the pre-salt were invited to participate, in addition to PRIO and the Mataripe Refinery. Three of them sent proposals: Galp, Petrobras and Refinaria de Mataripe. The offers, based on the Brent price, were opened in real time in a meeting held via the Teams platform between PPSA and representatives of participating companies. The Mataripe Refinery is located in São Francisco do Conde (BA), and its logistical assets are in Madre de Deus (BA).The first cargo from Atapu, also of 500 thousand barrels, was sold in January 2023 and was won by Galp Energia Brasil.

2930491819,"Feb 23, 2024",BP and Shell Are Worth Less Than Exxon and Chevron. Here's Why. The European oil majors are valued at a roughly one-third discount to their American counterparts.,https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bp-shell-are-worth-less-than-exxon-chevron-heres/docview/2930491819/se-2?accountid=7064,EQNR,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

BP and Shell, two of Europe's biggest oil-and-gas companies, have a valuation problem that they haven't been able to solve for decades.
Both trade at about a one-third discount to their U.S. peers. Exxon trades at 12 times forward earnings, as does Chevron. Shell, by contrast, is at eight times, while BP is at seven.
This is a conundrum that Shell CEO Wael Sawan and BP CEO Murray Auchincloss would like to crack. Their latest gambits are leading them in different directions, both from their American counterparts and from each other.
European and U.S. majors have diverged in their strategies. American firms are loading up on additional production—Exxon bought Pioneer and Chevron bought Hess. BP and Shell have stayed on the sidelines of the latest merger frenzy and have set themselves more aggressive targets for the energy transition away from fossil fuels.
That may be a good move in the long term, and many shareholders support it. But the companies are still under pressure to lift their share prices—and BP now has an activist investor arguing that the company needs to focus more on oil and gas. To close the gap, Shell and BP may have to get creative, or engage in some megadeals themselves—perhaps even with each other.
""It's unfortunate that they have ramped up capital allocation to these new energy areas at precisely the time that the economics have deteriorated."" said Tom Nelson, a London-based fund manager at Ninety One, the asset manager that used to be a part of Investec.
At its investor day in June last year, Shell CEO Sawan explained that ""We're not trying to emulate a European model or a U.S. model of valuations. What we're trying to do is to maximize the value of this investment thesis.""
A Shell spokesperson told Barron's that ""the aim is to enhance trust in Shell by delivering on a few key targets centered around increased distribution to shareholders, more investment discipline, lower cost base, and competitive growth in free cash flow.""
BP declined to comment for this article. Auchincloss said Feb. 6 that BP will continue to transition to an integrated energy company, rather than just an integrated oil company.
Before the pandemic, both Shell and BP pledged to reduce oil production in the coming years. Shell says it reached its goal early and will now keep liquids output flat through 2030 at about 1.4 million barrels a day. Compared to 2019 levels, that's a reduction of 26%.
BP aims to cut output by 25% from 2019 levels by 2030. It had previously aimed for a 40% reduction. That's been a problem for BP's share price—BP shares are up about 60% over the past three years. Exxon's have doubled.
Bluebell Capital Partners have taken a stake in BP and say that the company's output-cutting goals are still too aggressive. It argues that it would be better simply returning more cash to shareholders.
While it's clear that the market prefers the higher returns on capital deployed on fossil fuel investments compared with renewables, some say investors are being shortsighted.
""The more ambitious you are about trying to transform your business, the lower multiple the market is willing to pay for your earnings,"" said Nick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management. ""The market is getting this one wrong. To continue as though nothing is changing raises real questions about whether you are building a business that is going to be genuinely resilient for the long term.""
Part of the problem is that the economics of oil and gas have become stronger within the U.S. Exxon and Chevron's big purchases give them more domestic shale fields. Both BP and Shell have a big presence in the U.S., but it's not getting bigger, even after shale propelled the U.S. to become the world's biggest oil and gas producer, overtaking Saudi Arabia.
Shell's Sawan, for his part, says he will cut back the less-profitable low-carbon business. The company will be selective in its investments, he said. That means that it will focus more on natural gas, growing sales volumes of liquefied natural gas by as much as 30% by the end of the decade.
""Most shareholders want BP and Shell to continue to invest in oil and gas and then invest in new energy or low carbon where it makes sense or there's some sort of competitive advantage,"" said Allen Good, a strategist at Morningstar. ""Over the longer term, though, the better bet remains U.S. firms, given that oil and gas isn't going anywhere anytime soon.""
BP, Shell, Exxon and Chevron all stepped up dividends and share buybacks last year even though profits were lower than in 2022, when oil and gas prices shot up after Russia invaded Ukraine.
The European firms are paying out a lot of cash to try to keep shareholders content. BP's dividend yield is 4.9% and Shell's is 4.2%. Chevron offers 4.3%, while Exxon's is only at 3.8%.
The biggest shortcut to closing the valuation gap might be for European firms to engage in M&A themselves—not necessarily to add production, but for cost synergies. There is occasional speculation that Shell should buy BP among traders in London. ConocoPhillips is also sometimes mentioned as a suitor. BP might also consider tie-ups with smaller rivals such as France's TotalEnergies or Norway's Equinor to protect itself. Conoco, TotalEnergies and Equinor declined to comment for this article.
The European majors all are cheap by U.S. standards. Like BP, TotalEnergies also trades at seven times earnings. Equinor trades at eight times, the same as Shell.
""Looking at BP's valuation today, it's not trading on its knees,"" said Nelson. ""But in terms of leadership and strategy, it's potentially vulnerable.""
How vulnerable depends on how patient investors are willing to be. And as long as the valuation gap persists, the more pressure European companies will face to do something drastic.

Vale completed the installation of one of Brazil's largest battery energy storage systems at Guaíba Island Terminal in Rio de Janeiro. The system reduced electricity demand at peak times by 55%. The implementation led to a 40% reduction in spending with the local energy distributor.Key Highlights:* The batteries have a storage capacity of 10 megawatt-hours.* Vale announced an investment of US$ 4 to 6 billion to reduce emissions by 33% by 2030.Original Press Release:Feb. 20 -- Vale issued the following news release:- Technology is an important step in the company's energy transition strategyAt the Guaíba Island Terminal (TIG) in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Vale has completed the installation of one of the country's largest battery energy storage systems for supplying electricity demand. In operation since the second half of last year, BESS (Battery Energy Storage Systems) has reduced electricity demand at peak times by 55%. By supplementing the supply from the concessionaire's electricity grid at this time, when the tariff is more expensive, the implementation allowed for a 40% reduction in spending with the local energy distributor that serves TIG.Composed of lithium-ion batteries manufactured by Tesla and using software engineering from the company Micropower for consumption management, the equipment is charged whenever TIG's electrical demand is low, thus supplementing the supply from the utility at times when demand tariffs are higher.""The pioneering system applied at TIG is now the largest in Brazil for an end consumer and lays the foundations for increasing the use of this technology within the company to meet a variety of needs. By reducing the use of the electricity grid, precisely at the time when the entire country's consumption is highest, we are helping to avoid the activation of thermoelectric plants based on fossil fuels, which tend to increase their participation at this time to reinforce the national interconnected system,"" says Ludmila Nascimento, Vale's Energy and Decarbonization director.Developed in partnership with Siemens and Micropower, a joint venture involving Comerc Energia, Siemens and Equinor, the technology is in line with Vale's decarbonization strategy. The batteries are produced using lithium-ion technology and have a storage capacity of 10 megawatt-hours, enough to supply 45,000 homes for one hour. On their own, they can supply half of all the ore terminal's equipment at the same time for two hours a day. ""We are very happy to contribute to a robust storage system in an operation as large as the one Vale has. Being able to save 40% of the value of a monthly demand bill is a significant amount, and this shows the high capacity of our system,"" says Sergio Jacobsen, CEO of Micropower.Vale announced an investment of US$ 4 to 6 billion to reduce its absolute direct and indirect emissions by 33% by 2030, based on the assumptions of the Paris Agreement, in addition to its intention to zero its net emissions by 2050.About ValeVale is a global mining company that exists to improve lives and transform the future together. One of the world's largest producers of iron ore and nickel and an important copper producer, Vale is headquartered in Brazil and operates globally. Its operations comprise integrated logistics systems, including approximately 2,000 kilometers of railroads, maritime terminals and 10 ports around the world.

1548 ET – The U.S. biogas industry saw a third consecutive year of record growth in 2023, with $1.8 billion invested in new projects, the American Biogas Council says. Growth is expected to continue in 2024, with over 100 new projects slated to go into operation this year, the trade group says. ""In 2023, 96 new biogas projects became operational in the U.S., pushing the total number of active U.S. biogas projects to 2,251, which represents $39 billion in capital investment,"" according to the council. While landfill gas leads in both investment dollars and biogas output, the agricultural sector and the food waste sector both saw significant gains last year. ( stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com )
0524 ET – Orsted's earnings beat expectations and there should be scope for improving sentiment towards the offshore industry through the year, Deutsche Bank analyst James Brand writes. The bank likes Orsted's plan to fix the balance sheet primarily via disposals and a dividend holiday, rather than a capital increase, as well as the more sensible investment program. The next major update will be results of the accelerated New York auction, in late February or early March, which will hopefully see Orsted secure a higher power purchase agreement for its Sunrise project, Brand says. ""There are a number of auctions [this year], and we expect PPA prices to clearly rise."" Deutsche Bank lifts its target price to DKK470 from DKK450 and retains its buy rating. Share trade 2.3% higher at DKK407.40. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0514 ET – RWE has made significant progress and its current and medium-term financial targets are almost double what was expected years ago, but that progress is not reflected in the German renewable energy company's share price, Citi analyst Piotr Dzieciolowski says in a research note. The analyst says that the market is underappreciating RWE despite it raising last year its 2027 Ebitda and net income targets when compared with expectations disclosed in late 2021. ""For the stock to re-rate, we think we will need to see stabilizing power prices, improved investor sentiment around renewables, and progress on project execution,"" the analyst says. RWE shares trade 0.92% higher at EUR32.81. ( pierre.bertrand@wsj.com )
0407 ET – Jefferies no longer believes that Equinor's near-term distribution yield will provide valuation support, while further downside will be driven by falling European gas prices for 2025 and 2026, analyst Giacomo Romeo writes. This raises questions around the sustainability of Equinor's new distribution guidance, which already underpins an underwhelming valuation relative to peers, he says. ""Based on Equinor's base case cash flow guidance, post-2025 there isn't free cash flow upside to support higher distributions, and distribution yields will fall from 14% in 2024 to 7%-10% in 2025 and then to 6% after that."" Jefferies cuts its price target to NOK210 from NOK270 and keeps its underperform rating. Shares trade 1.4% lower at NOK274. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
1738 ET – Macquarie thinks there's room for a deal if Beach Energy wants to buy assets from Santos as part of the bigger company's restructuring. ""We expect this could include straight asset purchases, or even something broader,"" such as Santos taking an in-specie distribution of Beach shares while transferring some assets to Beach, Macquarie says. The bank thinks several of Santos's domestic assets would interest Beach, such as conventional oil and gas fields in the Cooper Basin, natural-gas fields in Western Australia, and Santos's majority owned Dorado oil field. ""However clearly the scale is large for Beach,"" Macquarie says. ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)"

0858 ET – Equinor's capital distributions are expected to remain at lofty levels in 2024-2025 before normalising in 2026, but concerns on offshore wind profitability and rising renewables capex weighs on sentiment, HSBC analyst Kim Fustier writes. The 8% share price drop on the day of its earnings suggests that consensus expectations on shareholder returns were too high and that the market is wary of rising spending in renewables, the bank says. Green spending is set to rise from a low base to 25%-30% of total capex by 2030 and concerns around offshore wind's profitability remain top of mind, HSBC says. HSBC retains its hold rating on Equinor and lowers its target price to NOK315 from NOK350. Shares trade 0.3% higher at NOK278.40. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
0832 ET – Aker Carbon Capture's 2023 results showed strong revenue growth, good cost control and high levels of activity in the commercial pipeline, which grew 46% in 4Q, Berenberg analysts say in a note. Encouragingly, its active projects are progressing well, and the company has expanded its North American relationship with MAN Energy Solutions."" The balance sheet remains in good shape and overall, Berenberg remains positive about the long-term outlook for carbon capture and storage and the company's ability to deliver good market share as projects start to reach final investment decisions. Berenberg rates Aker Carbon Capture at hold with a NOK16 price target. Shares trade 1% higher at NOK10.40. (dominic.chopping@wsj.com)
0827 ET – Innergex Renewable Energy may be planning a new capital allocation strategy, which could include a dividend cut, Nelson Ng says in a report for RBC. The analyst says that the company's payout ratio has been at or above 100%, including prospective project expense, for the past five years. Ng says that a much lower payout is appropriate for a growth company at this point so that it can better manage its medium-term debt and remain financially flexible. This could put off some investors in the near-term, and so RBC lowers its target price to C$11 from C$13 ""to reflect our view that there will be a transition period before investors can get more constructive on the company's strategy."" (adriano.marchese@wsj.com)
0427 ET – SAP's pick of former Nokia President Pekka Ala-Pietila instead of Punit Renjen to succeed long-time Chairman Hasso Plattner came as unexpected news, UBS analysts write in a note to investors. The German business-software company last year nominated Renjen to replace Plattner, who served as chairman since 2003, but agreed to part ways with him following a disagreement. ""Renjen never became chairman so, arguably, the fact he will not take up the role has no impact,"" the analysts say. Ala-Pietila will stand for election for a two-year term at the company's annual general meeting on May 15 and assume the role of chairman if elected. SAP shares trade 0.7% lower at EUR167.22.

What you need to know 3 S&P 500 climbs to within touching distance of 5,000 points on Wall Street ? Mainland Chinese stocks rise as officials attempt to boost confidence ? European indices pulled lower by decline for energy groups Wall Street's S&P 500 rose to within touching distance of 5,000 for the first time yesterday as a handful of the largest tech companies continued to propel US stocks to record highs.
The S&P was 0.7 per cent higher in early afternoon trading in New York at 4,990.62, having last month surpassed a previous record set on January 3 2022.
The tech-dominated Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8 per cent, leaving the index just over 2 per cent short of its record high, hit in November 2021.
Both indices have recently been driven higher by six of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have propped up US markets, even as central banks last year ratcheted up interest rates to combat inflation.
Tesla's almost 25 per cent year to date decline has seen it bumped from the elite list, however, leaving US stock markets increasingly top-heavy.
""The hunger to buy these stocks on any and all dips appears to be the reason for the bulletproof nature of the S&P 500 lately,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading at Harvest Volatility Management.
""Either they will roll over and take the index with them or they will hold everything up while the rest of the market gathers [itself] to rejuvenate a broad bullish march,"" Zigmont added.
Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet
Asset Management, said market momentum meant even sceptical investors had little choice but to join the rally. ""If you are not bullish on equities and you see your competitors are doing well, you're forced to follow.""
Chinese equities, in contrast, have slumped to multiyear lows on concerns over the country's ailing property market and economic slowdown.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index lost 0.3 per cent while China's CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen stocks added 1 per cent as Chinese officials attempt to boost market confidence and Beijing's ""national team"" of state-run financial institutions step up their purchases of the largest stocks.
European equities fell, pulled lower by a decline for energy stocks after Norwegian group Equinor reported a steep drop in earnings due to ""significantly"" lower gas prices.
The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 closed 0.2 per cent lower with Equinor the steepest faller.
The CAC 40 index in Paris retreated 0.4 per cent while both London's FTSE 100 and Frankfurt's Xetra Dax slipped 0.7 per cent. George SteerMarkets update

TotalEnergies said it would lift its 2023 dividend and increase payouts this year, joining other energy companies such as Shell, BP and Equinor in splashing out on shareholder returns.
The French oil-and-gas company said it would distribute a cumulative 2023 dividend of 3.01 euros, equivalent to $3.24 a share, a 7.1% increase from a year earlier. The company proposed a final interim dividend for 2023 of 0.79 euros a share.
It said it intends to return more than 40% of cash flow from operations excluding working capital to shareholders in 2024, combining a 6.8% increase in interim dividends to 0.79 euros a share and $2 billion of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2024.
In doing so, TotalEnergies becomes the latest energy company to dish out generous shareholder returns. Peers BP and Shell this month said they would respectively buy back $1.75 billion and $3.5 billion of shares in the first quarter of the year.
Meanwhile, Norway's Equinor said on Wednesday that it would buy back between $10 billion and $12 billion of shares over two years, with up to $6 billion this year. For 2023, the company bought back $6 billion of shares.
TotalEnergies' dividend increase comes after it made $5.06 billion in fourth-quarter net profit, compared with $3.26 billion a year prior and analysts' expectations of $5.65 billion, according to consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Sales fell to $59.24 billion from $68.58 billion.
Hydrocarbon production rose 12% on year to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
The company said it expects its hydrocarbon production to rise by 2% this year, and exceed 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first quarter, boosted by the start of operations at Mero 2 in Brazil. Production will further benefit from project startups in the U.S. and Denmark, the company said.
TotalEnergies said it expects to invest $17 billion to $18 billion in 2024, while its refining utilization rate is expected to rise to above 85%.

| Jump to first hitNORWEGIAN gas giant Equinor said it would be cutting overall payments to shareholders despite beating analyst expectations for a weaker 2023.
The company, which is majority-owned by the government of Norway with a 67 per cent stake, saw net operating income plunge to $36.2bn (£28.6bn) in 2023 from a record-breaking $76.9bn (£60.9bn) in 2020 as gas prices climbed down from the highs seen after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Accordingly, Equinor will reduce the amount paid to shareholders from $17bn (£13.4bn) last year to $14bn (£11bn) this year as more money will be put back into the business.
The firm overtook Russian provider Gazprom as Europe's largest natural gas supplier after the continent severed ties with the former to try and prevent funding Russia's military machine.
It plans on spending the 2023 level of $6bn (£4.8bn) in share buybacks in 2024. Chief executive Anders Opedal said the company remains ""well-positioned to deliver profitable growth,"" in the sector but estimated that ""rapid cash flow growth"" may not come before 2030.
Shares in the firm closed down just over seven per cent."

0911 ET – Precision Drilling's Canadian operations continue to provide a standout performance, according to RBC. In a report, analyst Keith Mackey says the company remains sold out of its 30 super-triple rigs in Canada, with 80 total rigs currently running in the large oil reserve region of the western Canadian sedimentary basin. Mackey notes that Precision said on an investor call that in 1Q it sees rig margins remaining above C$15,000 a day, and that ""it has 21 rigs contracted for 2024 in Canada as operators seek to lock up rigs ahead of LNG project start-ups."" The analyst sees this growth in Canada continuing, partially offsetting weakness in the U.S. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0900 ET – Ethanol company Green Plains says it's undertaking a strategic review, including potential acquisitions, divestitures, a merger or sale. The Nebraska company says there is no timeline yet for its review process. Activist investor Ancora Holdings last year urged Green Plains to put itself up for a sale. Green Plains says its ethanol sales were down from the prior year and the industry faces long-term pressure from a greater potential shift to electric vehicles. Ethanol companies are hoping they can increase their share of ethanol in aviation fuel to offset their challenges. Green Plains surges 11% in premarket trading.( patrick.thomas@wsj.com )
0708 ET – Orsted's strategic update is everything the market had expected, but the question is whether this is this enough for the shares to rise further after their recent strong performance, Citi analysts Jenny Ping and Rory Graham-Watson write. The company's 2030 capacity target of 35-38 gigawatts from 50 gigawatts, Ebitda cut to DKK39 billion-DKK43 billion from DKK50 billion-DKK55 billion, dividend pause, asset disposals and cost reductions are all as expected, they say. ""For Orsted, its all about delivery of targets and building investor confidence, which will take time."" The commitment to protect the balance sheet should help its credit rating, but clearly will limit growth without equity, they say. Citi rates Orsted at neutral with a DKK370 price target. Shares trade 2% lower at DKK377.70. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0703 ET – Orsted results are above guidance, but most interesting is the capex plan update, where growth ambitions through to 2030 were cut back by more than UBS had expected, analyst Mark Freshney writes. There is no capital raise, which is positive, albeit the dividend has been suspended for three years, he says. Guidance for 2024 Ebitda excluding new farm downs of DKK23 billion-DKK26 billion compares to a company-supplied consensus of DKK25.8 billion, but UBS notes the company has a track record in issuing conservative guidance. Capex is cut to DKK270 billion across 2024-2030, which is in line with UBS expectations, while Ebitda in 2026 is guided to DKK30 billion-DKK34 billion versus DKK32 billion seen by UBS. Shares trade 1.6% lower at DKK379.50. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0503 ET – TotalEnergies' dividend increase for 2023 came in lower than expected, Jefferies analysts Giacomo Romeo and associate Kai Ye Loh say in a research note. The French oil-and-gas company said that it would propose a 7.1% higher dividend for 2023 compared with 2022, for a total dividend of EUR3.01 a share. TotalEnergies also said that it would buy back $2 billion of its shares, in line with expectations, the analysts say. Fourth-quarter results were in line with expectations, the analysts say, and the company's adjusted net income of $5.2 billion beat Jefferies' estimate by 1%. Shares trade down 1.6% at EUR59.32. ( pierre.bertrand@wsj.com )
0357 ET – Equinor's updated strategic plan is reliant on the ability to hold volume declines in maturing Norway oil-and-gas at 2% per year from 2026, Citi analysts write in a research note. ""The importance of this core business means there is a lot of operational leverage to this 'managed decline' assumption,"" they say. ""And that, we think, gives little headroom for investors to underwrite a renewables buildout where economics look to remain challenged by competition and market conditions."" Shares in the Norwegian energy major are down 4.4% at NOK294.90. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )
0333 ET – Equinor's shareholder distribution looks better than anticipated, while stronger upstream output in Norway and internationally drove a beat to consensus's EBIT forecast, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria writes in a research note. The result in upstream partially offset weakness in renewables, while the results in marketing, midstream and processing slightly missed consensus at $424 million versus $461 million. The Norwegian energy major intends to hand $14 billion cash back to shareholders in 2024. ""This is above consensus expectations which we believe were in the $12 billion-$13 billion range,"" the analyst says. Shares are down 3.4% at NOK298. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )
2002 ET – SK Innovation's battery business may be in operating loss through 1H, despite support from an estimated KRW250 billion U.S. tax credit for each of 1Q and 2Q, Daiwa Capital analysts Henny Jung and Yoonki Bae say in a research note. The South Korean energy company, which owns EV-battery maker SK On, could see average selling prices for its battery products decline and battery shipments weaken on high inventory levels at its customers, the analysts note.

1528 ET – Crude futures rise for a second straight session after last week's selloff but with gains limited by easing expectations of wider conflict in the Middle East. ""Oil is still moving. It's moving more slowly, so the market's on edge, but they're also keeping an eye very closely on what the Federal Reserve is going to do,"" says Phil Flynn of the Price Futures Group. Saudi Arabia's decision to keep its official selling price unchanged in March was supportive as it ""suggests that they're not concerned about losing market share, or demand,"" he says, and adds that Wednesday's inventories report from the EIA will probably be ""pretty sanguine."" WTI for March delivery settles up 0.7% at $73.31 a barrel, and April Brent rises 0.8% at $78.59 a barrel. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )"

TotalEnergies said it would lift its 2023 dividend and increase payouts this year, joining other energy companies such as Shell, BP and Equinor in splashing out on shareholder returns.
The French oil and gas company said it would distribute a cumulative 2023 dividend of 3.01 euros ($3.24) a share, a 7.1% increase from a year earlier. The company proposed a final interim dividend for 2023 of EUR0.79 a share.
It said it intends to return more than 40% of cash flow from operations excluding working capital to shareholders in 2024, combining a 6.8% increase in interim dividends to EUR0.79 a share and $2 billion of share buybacks in the first quarter of 2024.
In doing so, TotalEnergies becomes latest energy company to dish out generous shareholder returns. Peers BP and Shell this month said they would respectively buy back $1.75 billion and $3.5 billion of shares in the first quarter of the year. Meanwhile, Norway's Equinor said Wednesday that it would buy back between $10 billion and $12 billion of shares over two years, with up to $6 billion this year. For 2023, the company bought back $6 billion of shares.
TotalEnergies' dividend hike comes after it made $5.06 billion in fourth-quarter net profit, compared with $3.26 billion a year prior and analysts' expectations of $5.65 billion, according to consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Sales fell to $59.24 billion from $68.58 billion.
Hydrocarbon production rose 12% on year to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
The company said it expects its hydrocarbon production to rise by 2% this year, and exceed 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the first quarter, boosted by the start of operations at Mero 2 in Brazil. Production will further benefit from project start-ups in the U.S. and Denmark, the company said.
TotalEnergies said it expects to invest $17 billion to $18 billion in 2024, while its refining utilization rate is expected to rise to above 85%.

1342 ET – The province of Quebec will likely be a good source of growth opportunities for both renewable energy companies, Boralex and Innergex, Sean Steuart of TD Cowen says. In a report, he notes that Hydro-Quebec has awarded Boralex and Innergex wind project of 364 MW and 400 MW, respectively, representing 39% of the gross capacity as part of the province's RFP. While the scale of these projects is modest relative to their existing asset base, Steuart says that ""these wins reaffirm our view that Quebec should offer consistent growth opportunities for Boralex and Innergex.""

1330 ET – Both the U.S. and Canada added active oil and gas rigs in the past week, although the count remains below that of this time last year. According to Baker Hughes' latest rig count, the U.S. total rig count rose by one to 621 rigs—with 2 oil rigs being added and 1 gas rig subtracted. Canada added 7 rigs for the week, bringing that total to 230 rigs. However, U.S. rigs remain 150 rigs below this time last year, and Canada's rig count is down 17 from last year. Crude oil futures have been paring losses this afternoon, with that most-active contract down 0.3%. Brent crude is down 0.1%. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1046 ET – Natural gas has continued its decline from yesterday, with the most-active contract down 0.6%. The driving force weighing on prices is the Biden Administration's decision to pause approvals for liquefied natural gas exports. ""The news of the Biden Admin holding up new export (LNG) facilities for further environmental testing could be a looming bearish factor and may have contributed to the sell-off earlier in the week,"" says BOK Financial in a note. Warmer temperatures seen in the U.S. is also pushing natural gas prices down. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1038 ET – Equinor and BP have ended their U.S. offshore wind partnership, with Equinor taking full ownership of the Empire Wind lease and now taking on a ""meaningful"" near-term capex increase into a low return project, RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria writes. Equinor is submitting a new bid for the project as the previous contract price was deemed to be uneconomic, but under the new expected price point the project is expected to generate a return in the low end of Equinor's guided range of 4%-8%, which is ""hardly inspiring,"" Borkhataria adds. BP has taken over the Beacon Wind lease and it expects to take an impairment charge of $600 million. Following a $540 million impairment in 3Q, the original acquisition cost is effectively fully written off. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0945 ET – Crude oil is down in early trading, with worries about Chinese demand outweighing a better-than-expected 4Q 3.3% U.S. GDP growth rate. ""Crude oil is lower after rising yesterday on stronger U.S. growth boosting hopes of increasing demands,"" says Peter Cardillo of Spartan Capital. ""However, we do not see prices moving much higher since the E. Z. and China growth prospects remain bleak."" The Federal Reserve will meet next week, which will provide further direction for oil and stocks. Crude oil is down 0.7% to $76.77 a barrel, while Brent crude is down 0.6% to $81.46 a barrel.

0832 ET – Cenovus Energy is working on building momentum in 2024, and RBC's Greg Pardy says the company's focus on execution and delivery should help drive the share price higher. The analyst says in a report that the Canadian energy company is in its second of a three-year investment cycle that should support about 110,000-125,000 barrel of oil equivalent a day of new production down the road. This would put Cenovus' production at around 900,000-950,000 boe/d in 2027. He adds that the company's operating and financial results will ""establish improved momentum as 2024 unfolds, opening the door to relative share price appreciation over the next six months or so.""

0304 ET – Galp Energia's oil discovery in Namibia derisks its exploration program in the African country, Citi analysts say in a note. The Portuguese state-owned oil and gas driller confirmed the discovery of a column of what it characterized as high-quality light oil as part of its exploration endeavors in Namibia, leading Citi to reiterate its 90-day positive catalyst watch and buy recommendation for the company. ""We upgraded Galp recently on our view of significant de-risking of Namibia exploration and the potential materiality of this resource, with much of that value to be clarified in the coming months,"" the analysts say, adding that they expect further positive results incoming.

2120 ET – Oil futures fall in the morning Asian session in a likely technical correction after settling at their highest levels since late November on Thursday. Heightened geopolitical risks, such as recent shipping disruptions, will maintain the 'price premium' in oil markets, Fitch Ratings says in an email. However, without material disruptions to oil production or a wider escalation of attacks to more vital oil transport routes in the Red Sea region, Fitch doesn't expect a strong upside to its $80/bbl Brent crude-oil-price assumption for 2024, given material OPEC+ spare capacity. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are down 0.5% at $76.96/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are 0.3% lower at $82.17/bbl. ( ronnie.harui@wsj.com )
2059 ET – Tenaga Nasional may post stronger 4Q results, with UOB Kay Hian analyst Chong Lee Len tipping its net profit at MYR1 billion, compared with MYR856.2 million in 3Q. The utility company was likely supported by an improvement in fuel margins amid stabilized coal prices, which could offset higher year-end expenses, she reckons. Tenaga's cash flow management could benefit from continued government subsidies, she says, adding that Tenaga may distribute dividends at the upper end of its expected range. UOB KH maintains a hold rating on Tenaga and keeps its target price at MYR10.70. Shares are 0.2% lower at MYR10.50. ( yingxian.wong@wsj.com )
1341 ET – Parkland's prolonged refinery shut down is costing it in missed earnings, according to of TD Cowen. Analyst Michael Van Aelst says in a report that due to cold weather, Parkland had paused the processing operations at its Burnaby refinery. ""The processing operations have been down for about a week and a half now, so in all, the refinery will be down for about five and a half weeks,"" he says. Van Aelst estimates the refinery generates about C$9 million of Ebitda a week, which ""would imply a negative impact from the shutdown of around $50mm before any offsets.""

| Jump to first hitNorway's national oil company Equinor has announced that it has sold its shares in two Azerbaijani oil fields and the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan oil pipeline to Azerbaijan's state oil company SOCAR and will exit from Azerbaijan after 30 years in the country.""Equinor is in the process of reshaping its international oil and gas business, and the divestments in Azerbaijan are in line with our strategy to focus our international portfolio,"" said Philippe Mathieu, Equinor's executive vice-president for international exploration and production in a statement released on December 22.In its statement on the purchase of Equinor's assets SOCAR confirmed only that it had signed an agreement to buy Equinor's assets in Azerbaijan and that ""the transaction will be completed following compliance with all regulatory requirements and contractual obligations.""The oil field assets consist of a 7.27 percent stake in Azerbaijan's giant Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oil field which produces the bulk of Azerbaijan's oil exports, and a 50 percent stake in the much smaller Karabakh oil field which has yet to start production. (Both oil fields are in the Caspian Sea.)In addition, Equinor is selling its 8.71 percent stake in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline which runs from the Caspian through Azerbaijan and Georgia to Turkey's Mediterranean oil hub at Ceyhan, through which most of Azerbaijan's oil exports are made.The purchase by SOCAR takes the state-owned company's stake in ACG to 32.27 percent, in the BTC pipeline to 33.71 percent and gives it complete ownership of the Karabakh field.Neither company stated the price being paid for Equinor's assets.However, the timing of the sale suggests that Equinor is selling at a point when it believes it can get the best price from the sale.Crude oil prices are still higher than they have been for most of the past decade thanks to the disruption to global oil markets caused first by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago, and more recently by Israel's invasion of Gaza and the attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea.Similarly, security concerns for the safety of shipping in the Black Sea in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict have disrupted the flow of crude oil through the three pipelines which carry crude oil from the Caspian to the Black Sea.BP last year halted exports of crude from Azerbaijan via its Baku-Supsa pipeline, exporting the oil via the BTC pipeline instead.Similarly, Kazakhstan has reduced the volume of oil it sends by pipeline to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, signing an agreement to send 1.5 million tons a year via the BTC pipeline instead, a volume which may well be increased if the war in Ukraine further threatens the safety of Black Sea shipping.It also comes ahead of an anticipated boost in oil production from the ACG field thanks to the drilling of new wells, and with further new wells suggesting that the field could also produce natural gas.The decision by SOCAR to purchase all of Equinor's assets suggests Baku is intent both on maximizing its returns from its main export revenue earner, and keeping close control on its main oil export route.Azerbaijan's crude oil and natural gas exports are the country's main source of revenue, accounting for around 90 percent of export revenue and funding as much as 60 percent of the state's annual budget.Hydrocarbons also supply 98 percent of the country's primary energy usage and generate around 90 percent of its electricity.That dependence on fossil fuels is something Baku would like to change, with ambitious plans to develop its renewable energy resources both to meet growing domestic power demand and to export any excess power to Europe.It's debatable whether Baku's commitment to renewables is primarily due to its Paris Agreement commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent from 1990 by 2030, or more to a desire to free up extra volumes of oil and gas for export.Either way Azerbaijan will host the UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) in November this year and has been concluding agreements with a host of international players aiming at tapping their experience of wind, solar and hydropower development.The latest of these being Equinor itself, which as a parting gesture to Baku has signed a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to ""share experience and best practice on low carbon solutions, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon management.""SOCAR also interested in Lukoil refinery in BulgariaIn addition to increasing its stake in Azerbaijan's ACG oil field, SOCAR is also showing interest in further expanding its operations ""downstream.""According to Azerbaijan's ambassador in Bulgaria, SOCAR may be interested in purchasing the Neftohim Burgas oil refinery near the Bulgarian port of Burgas, owned by Russia's Lukoil since 1999.Lukoil announced on December 5 that it was thinking of selling the 9.5 million tons/year refinery and its other assets in Bulgaria.The announcement was in response to the cancelation of a European Union waiver that allowed it to continue to refine Russian crude oil despite the ban on imports of Russian crude into the EU, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Lukoil's Bulgarian operations also include a chain of over 200 gas stations, nine fuel depots and businesses supplying marine and aviation fuels and lubricants.SOCAR opened an office in the Bulgarian capital Sofia in April last year which currently only conducts natural gas trading.If it was to purchase Lukoil's refinery, SOCAR would be able to supply it with crude oil from Azerbaijan which it exports to the Black Sea via the Baku-Novorossiysk pipeline."

Offshore wind developers like strong gusts. The inflationary blasts that led to impairments totalling nearly $5bn last year from companies including Ørsted, Equinor and BP were, however, a little too much for everyone.
The bad news didn't stop there. Equinor and BP this week cancelled a contract to sell energy from one of their projects planned off the New York coast to the local state. Even so, 2023 should mark the nadir of the industry's woes.
Contract terminations make for bad headlines. They are proof, though, that most developers do now appear to be acting rationally.
Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, competition in the sector intensified to the extent that it was questionable how participants would make money from certain schemes, particularly in Europe.
More than 3GW worth of US offshore wind projects cancelled their offtake agreements last year, reckons BloombergNEF. Deals were typically struck before the Ukraine war, or not long after. Higher financing costs and a spike in the price of everything from cables to turbines later rendered them uneconomic. That was particularly the case where authorities were slow to grant permits.
In 2022, Equinor and BP had agreed to sell renewable energy credits from their 1.26GW Empire Wind 2 project in New York at $107.50 per megawatthour. The state's utilities regulator last year rejected a bid to raise this to $177.84/MWh.
US states and European governments are waking up to the sector's woes. Keen to press ahead with renewable energy targets, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority has fast-tracked a process through which developers can try to negotiate higher prices.
The UK has agreed to raise the maximum price offshore wind farm developers can secure in a contract auction this year by 66 per cent to £73/MWh (in 2012 prices).
Admittedly, 2024 will not be completely devoid of turbulence. Ørsted, which has specific issues, has yet to convince investors that it can avoid an equity raise. Siemens Energy also faces a battle to turn around its embattled turbine-making business.
For the sector as a whole, though, improving auction terms should mean that the prevailing wind will not be quite so chilly."

BP and Equinor reached a deal to scrap a contract to sell energy from a planned offshore wind power project to the state of New York, the latest such venture to be knocked off course by worsening industry economics.
The two Europe-based energy majors said authorities in the US state had allowed them to ""reset"" a 2022 arrangement to deliver power from their unbuilt 1.26-gigawatt Empire Wind 2 project ""in anticipation of new offtake opportunities"".
Higher costs and interest rates and supply disruptions have thwarted the business models of many offshore wind power projects in the US, setting back ambitious visions for the clean energy technology from the Joe Biden administration and several coastal states.
New York's climate law calls for the state to get 70 per cent of its electricity from renewables by 2030, with a target to install 9GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035.
As part of its plan, the state awarded BP and Equinor contracts to develop the Empire Wind complex about 15 miles south of New York's Long Island, with "" turbines set to be spread over 80,000 acres of sea.
The deal terminated on Wednesday was signed in 2022. BP and Equinor had agreed to sell renewable energy credits from the 1,260MW Empire Wind 2 phase of the project at a strike price of $107.50 a megawatt-hour.
'Commercial viability is fundamental for ambitious projects of this size and scale',"" said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas. ""The Empire Wind 2 decision provides the opportunity to reset and develop a stronger and more robust project going forward.""
The companies had earlier petitioned the state utilities regulator to renegotiate the prices of the credits, saying ""unforeseeable economic forces"" ? including inflation stemming from the war in Ukraine and Covid-19, supply chain bottlenecks and interest rate increases, along with permitting delays ? had affected the ""financial attractiveness"" of the project.
The requested relief would have increased the Empire Wind 2 strike price by two-thirds to $177.84/MWh, according to a document filed with the New York State Public Service Commission. The regulator denied their request in October.
But a separate state energy agency in November announced a new solicitation process that it said would be open to ""all project developers, including those that previously petitioned the New York State Public Service Commission for financial relief"". Bids under New York's new solicitation are due by January 25 with winners announced next month.
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, the agency responsible for wind power contract solicitations, said it ""remains committed to advancing clean energy at the best value for New Yorkers, and we are encouraged that Equinor and BP continue to be committed to developing the offshore wind industry and New York's green economy as they reset this project"".

After spending most of his career as an engineer in the oil and gas industry, Dan Jackson has turned his skills to greener ventures. He plans to put hundreds of floating turbines up to 200km off the Scottish coast, making him one of the pioneers of new technology designed to harness the greater wind speeds further out at sea.
The floating structures open up vast new areas offshore by overcoming the limitations of conventional turbines, which are fixed to the seabed and are difficult to install beyond depths of 60 metres. The new ones are more expensive to install, but those higher costs are offset by the fact they can generate significantly more energy.
""The wind resources out there are quite remarkable,"" said Jackson, founding director of Cerulean Winds, a private company based in England that wants to develop a network of three connected floating wind farms across almost 1,000 sq km of the North Sea.
The technology is key to the UK's goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2050. Industry executives believe it could account for more than half the 100-gigawatt target for offshore wind power generation by the middle of the century.
Jackson is aiming to have the initial 600-megawatt phase of his project up and running by 2028, putting it on course to be one of Britain's first largescale, commercial floating offshore wind farms. The project is designed to supply clean electricity to North Sea oil and gas platforms but increasingly send excess power to the mainland as fossil fuel extraction declines, he said.
Along with executives working on dozens of other floating offshore wind projects in British waters, Jackson will be closely watching two key events this year aimed at kick-starting the sector.
A fresh round of government subsidy contracts is expected to attract bids from several pilot schemes, which would join the two small demonstrator projects that are already operational off Scotland.
Separately, the Crown Estate, which manages the seabed off England, Northern Ireland and Wales, is hoping to attract bids in the first commercialscale floating wind auction in the Irish Sea, off south-west England. ""Floating offshore wind is a new frontier,"" said Dan Labbad, its chief executive.
So far 29 floating projects have secur- ed seabed leasing deals out of 51 in the pipeline with a combined capacity of 37GW, according to RenewableUK, the trade group. The vast majority of those are in Scotland, a global hub for offshore wind, with most at a very early stage.
At present, the UK has just two small floating wind pilot projects operational with a combined capacity of 80MW, compared to the 14GW from traditional ""fixed bottom"" wind turbines.
But the two pilots represent more than a third of the installed global capacity from floating turbines, underlining how Britain has exploited its access to the North Sea to become a pioneer in the offshore wind industry. ""It's one of the best wind corridors in the world,"" Jackson said.
One of those pilots, Hywind, was built by Equinor, Norway's state-controlled energy company, off Peterhead in Scot- land and became the world's first floating offshore wind farm to generate power in 2017.
The company has hailed it as a success with a capacity factor (a widely used metric calculating electricity generators' output as a proportion of theoretical maximum output) of 54 per cent over its first five years, ahead of the average capacity factor for offshore wind in Europe of 49 per cent This has convinced Equinor to explore further projects around Britain and elsewhere, including South Korea and the US. ""There also isn't much acreage left for fixed-bottom. Floating will be the new era,"" said Halfdan Brustad, vice-president for UK renewables at Equinor, who led the Hywind project.
Technology proving for floating projects is taking place alongside an increase in turbine size, which means each turbine can generate more power, improving the financial case for floating projects.
But the UK faces several hurdles to make the leap from test bed to commercial powerhouse in floating wind. Tim Pick, the government's offshore wind industry champion, warned in a report in April that getting more offshore projects into operation in the UK had become ""more rather than less difficult"", partly due to lengthy planning processes and slow grid connections.
Ministers have taken some steps to address those issues in recent months. Meanwhile, the Crown Estate's forthcoming leasing round will offer floating offshore wind developers a 50 per cent discount on their option fees if their projects are delayed in obtaining planning approval or other consents.
""We're trying to de-risk this as much as possible for developers,"" said Labbad. ""It's essential that we maintain the UK's position at the forefront globally.""
Pick has also warned that more needs to be done to encourage ports to invest so they can handle and store the large pieces of equipment required for floating offshore wind.
""Ports need to be able to invest as soon as possible and ahead of floating wind projects being ready to award contracts,""
Pick said last month. ""It's not clear that the right policy measures are there to get them comfortable with that.""
The next auction for government subsidy contracts must include some floating wind, said Ryanne Burges, director for offshore and Ireland at EDF Renewables UK and Ireland, whose 58MW Blyth 2 project is expected to be among the bidders.
""If we don't get these sites off the ground now, there will be a massive walk back in terms of investor confidence and supply chain confidence in the UK,"" she warned.
While his project is not yet ready to bid, Jackson said he had been encouraged by the decision by ministers to increase the support on offer after the 2023 auction failed to attract any bids from offshore wind farm developers.
""The government ... [has] recognised there needs to be a pathway to making [the contracts] work for floating,"" said Jackson.
""The changes are terrific for both sides. It means the UK is attractive for floating wind.""'We're trying to de-risk this as much as possible for developers. It's essential that we maintain the UK's position at the forefront globally'

BP and Equinor have canceled a major offshore wind contract near New York, leaving plans to provide hundreds of thousands of people with clean power in limbo. The project, known as Empire Wind 2, was expected to be installed 15 to 30 miles off the coast of Long Island and had already received important permits.
The cancellation was caused by ""inflation, interest rates and supply chain disruptions,"" Equinor said in a statement. The cost of materials like steel has soared over the past two years, cutting into the margins that wind developers expect to make on these projects. BP and Equinor had signed the Empire Wind deal with the state and utilities before inflation caused material prices to jump.
It isn't the first project derailed by those forces. In New Jersey, wind power company Orsted pulled out of two large projects last year because of similar inflationary and supply chain pressures. Orsted stock fell 39% in 2023 and the company wrote down the value of its wind projects by billions of dollars. Barron's had warned investors last summer that offshore wind's economics were deteriorating fast .
BP and Equinor's American depositary receipts were up 1.8% in recent Wednesday trading, while the S&P 500 fell 0.4%. Both companies still make most of their money from fossil fuels, and the stocks have been moving with oil, which rose Wednesday because of violence in the Middle East.
Also, the wind announcement wasn't a big surprise. Both companies have taken impairments related to their New York projects, after the state denied their request last year to increase the rates they would receive for the power produced by the turbines.
But Wednesday's news does represent another setback for America's clean power goals, after renewable energy stocks slumped in 2023. President Joe Biden had announced in 2021 a goal to install 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2030, enough to power about 10 million homes. The Empire Wind 2 project was expected to add 1.26 gigawatts of capacity. Empire Wind 1, which hasn't been canceled but faces similar cost pressures, is expected to add 0.8 gigawatts of capacity.
The announcement doesn't necessarily mean the Empire Wind 2 project is dead. The companies still hold federal leases on thousands of acres of ocean bedrock, as well as some permits. They could still finance turbines as long as they can find someone to pay for the power.
Equinor said it is now looking for other ""offtake"" agreements, though the company didn't specify what those agreements could look like and didn't respond to a request for comment. A BP representative said Equinor handles media requests about this project.
New York state will retain $6.3 million in ""contract security"" that the companies paid, and use the money to lower electricity costs for consumers. The state is also soliciting new bids to provide offshore wind power that could replace the power that BP and Equinor were expected to provide. New York already signed deals late last year with several companies, including French oil major TotalEnergies, for new offshore wind projects that paid more than the Empire Wind contracts. The enhanced economics—financed by taxes and higher electricity bills—could reinvigorate the industry, though it's likely to take several more years to develop these projects.

The UK's advertising regulator has banned Norway's state-backed energy company Equinor from repeating environmental claims it made in the months before gaining approval for a North Sea oilfield project.
In the ruling this week, the Advertising Standards Authority took issue with Equinor's suggestion that wind farms, oil and gas, and carbon capture play a balanced role in its energy mix, when most of the company's revenues still come from oil and gas.
In response to the complaint by the ASA about a specific ad placed in The Economist in June, Equinor told the regulator it was aimed at decision makers including politicians rather than the general public. In similar ads across British media, including the Financial Times, Equinor said ""wind, oil, gas, carbon capture and new jobs"" were part of ""the broader energy picture"".
The UK's North Sea Transition
Authority said in September it would allow Equinor and its partner Ithaca to develop Rosebank.
In its ban, the ASA said the ads were ""likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives"".
The group said it was ""disappointed by"" the ruling but respected it and would take note for future campaigns Environmental campaigners argue that new oil and gasfields are not compatible with the UK's plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and earlier this month launched legal action to block the permitting decision. Equinor has denied the oilfield plan would increase the UK's projected emissions. It is also involved in clean energy projects including the Dogger Bank wind farm in the North Sea.
Andrew Simms, co-founder of the Badvertising campaign, said the ban on Equinor's ads that were placed in the run-up to the Rosebank decision showed ""the urgent need to remove fossil fuel advertising's influence from our public and political spheres"".
At issue is the public understanding about the role so-called lower-carbon fuels and carbon capture technologies, which are undeveloped at scale, could play in the shift from burning hydrocarbons to clean energy.
The ASA said ads with environmental claims ""must not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their activities that comprised renewable energy and CCS [carbon capture and storage], or the role those activities played in the business"".'[There is an] urgent need to remove fossil fuel advertising's influence from public and political spheres'

| Jump to first hitCOP28 was historic. To stand any chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5oc, the era of coal, oil and gas has to end.In agreeing to transition away from fossil fuels, COP28 was the first time fossil fuels had been included in a UN climate change text.However, a closer look at the text reveals a litany of loopholes, escape hatches that allow the industry to continue with business as usual while professing to fight a good fight. From their perspective: mission accomplished.That should come as no surprise given their lobbyists flooded COP28, which itself was presided over by an oil executive.Ensuring the deal is truly historic means we need to ensure climate policy isn't co-opted by the fossil fuel industry. That means addressing the problem, root-and-branch, in Brussels as much as at the UN.Fossil fuels take centre stageThe process had been co-opted long before the opening ceremony in Dubai. The appointment of Sultan Al Jaber, CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), as COP28 president was understandably met with outrage. It's a glaring conflict of interest. But this was only a more blatant example of what has been the case for years: the fossil fuel industry in charge of the talks.As week one began, the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition revealed that almost four times as many fossil fuel lobbyists were at COP28 compared to the previous year. The 2,456 lobbyists outnumbered the combined delegations of the 10 most climate-vulnerable nations.The five oil and gas supermajors - BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil and Chevron - together brought 65 lobbyists, with all except Chevron being led by their chief executive. Italian Eni and Norwegian Equinor also secured spots for their top execs, attending as part of very large lobby teams (24 and 14 staff members, respectively).Norway's government had already publicly announced it was inviting Equinor to the talks, but more than 130 fossil fuel lobbyists were brought in by European governments and the European Commission. This included the chief executives of Italian Eni, French TotalEnergies and Belgian gas transporter Fluxys.Do you really think Shell or Chevron or ExxonMobil are sending lobbyists to passively observe these talks? Asked Alexia Leclercq from Start:Empowerment, a member of Kick Big Polluters Out.The industry was there to rehabilitate its image as part of the solution. Key to this was the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, championed by Al Jaber and signed by 50 industry executives.They all pledged to reach net zero by 2050 for their operations, but not the emissions from their core product. That would hypothetically allow oil and gas production to increase, so long as the rigs were solar-powered.A litany of oily loopholesGerman foreign minister Annalena Baerbock heralded the COP28 outcome as the end of the fossil fuels era. But negotiators from the small island states lambasted the litany of loopholes in the text.So many that even the oil and gas majors welcomed the outcome. Loopholes include no definition of what a transition away from fossil fuels means, no timeline, and the text also recognises a role for transitional fuels, industry speak for fossil gas.UK Minister of State for Climate Graham Stuart even told the BBC that new licences for oil and gas drilling in the North Sea were absolutely a transition away from fossil fuels.The text explicitly supports low-emission technologies, name-checking carbon capture and utilisation and storage (CCUS) and low-carbon hydrogen (aka hydrogen made from fossil gas with CCUS).Both are dangerous distractions actively promoted by industry as a way to keep pumping oil and gas, shifting focus from leaving fossil fuels in the ground to reducing their emissions.COP28 itself saw numerous voluntary initiatives around CCUS and low-carbon hydrogen readily backed by governments and fossil fuel executives.Prevent the pyromaniacs from enteringTo make the COP28 outcome truly historic, we need to free the talks - and our political and economic systems - from the oily grip of the fossil fuel industry. This particularly applies to the EU. European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra has ties to big polluters.That's why the Kick Big Polluters Out campaign is fighting for a conflict of interest policy to protect the talks and our capitals from fossil fuel interference. We've done the same to the tobacco industry, creating a firewall to protect decision-makers from the tobacco lobby. Now it's time for coal, oil and gas.Next June will see negotiators reconvene in Bonn in preparation for COP29. Conflicts of interest will be on the agenda. Expect a fight as the fossil fuel industry and the governments that support it will not go quietly into the night - at the UN and in our capitals.Pascoe Sabido is Researcher and Campaigner and the Corporate Europe Observatory and the co-coordinator of the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition.Source: Euronews"

Norway's Equinor signed its biggest long-term gas contract in nearly 40 years yesterday in a €50bn deal with German state energy group SEFE. It comes as EU countries seek stable supplies to compensate for the loss of piped gas from Russia.
The deal would supply Germany with 129bn cubic metres of gas up to 2039, enough to cover a third of the country's industrial demand, said Anders Opedal, chief executive of state-owned Equinor.
It ensured energy security for Europe's industrial hub and showed ""close collaboration"" between Germany and Norway after Moscow cut gas supplies in retaliation for sanctions over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, he added.
The agreement would reflect market prices, which at current value would make the deal worth about €50bn, according to people with knowledge of the contract.
The sudden depletion of cheap Russian gas last year left EU countries rushing to find supplies and secure contracts with friendly countries. The European Commission has signed memorandums of understanding with several gas producing nations such as Qatar and the US in order to guarantee stable flows.
EU energy ministers were due to discuss the level of gas supplies this winter and agree on the extension of emergency measures introduced last year, such as cuts to gas demand, at a meeting yesterday.
Opedal said Equinor's deal with SEFE was part of increasing appetite for longterm gas contracts as EU governments locked in supplies despite ambitious decarbonisation targets. The bloc aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
""We are signing contracts now that are longer and for larger volumes,"" Opedal said, adding that between 2021 and 2023 the total number of contracts agreed by Equinor had more than doubled, with a notable increase in longterm deals.
He added that the trend had also been driven by the realisation that renewable energy would not come online quickly enough to replace fossil fuel demand. ""It takes time to develop a new energy system and we will need gas,"" he said.
Gas when burnt produces fewer emissions than coal or oil.
The gas will be delivered through pipes from Norway to hubs in the UK, Netherlands and Germany.
SEFE, previously named Gazprom Germania and owned by the Russian energy group Gazprom, was nationalised by Berlin in November 2022 and recapitalised for €6.3bn in December after incurring big losses.
Norway has replaced Russia as the EU's largest gas supplier, providing half of the bloc's piped gas.
The Equinor deal also includes a nonbinding letter of intent for SEFE to buy hydrogen produced by the Norwegian group using gas but with carbon capture technologies. Hydrogen is seen as a crucial fuel for decarbonising heavy industries such as fertiliser and steel but low carbon hydrogen has yet to be produced at any significant scale.'We are signing contracts now that are longer and for larger volumes' Anders Opedal, Equinor CEO

| Jump to first hitVietnam is set to welcome a high influx of green investment from global corporations following its strong commitments made at the 28th UN Climate Change conference (COP28) recently held in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Denmark that has acquired much experience in green transition shows interest in developing wind power in Vietnam At COP28, members of the group of seven industrial countries such as the United States, the EU, and the UK announced their US$15.5 billion commitment to help Vietnam realise its net zero emissions goal under the signed political declaration on the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP).Vietnam is also becoming the focus of attention for further green investment, as shown by the interest of foreign investors in their meetings with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Turkey and the UAE. At the Vietnam - UAE business forum, foreign businesses showed how highly they value the great Vietnamese potential for the development of renewable energy sources such as wind power and solar power, outlining that the country has the opportunity to become a renewable energy supply chain hub.Over recent years the country has become one of the leading state actors in terms of developing wind power and solar power, with many large-scale projects getting underway. The 2015 -2022 period alone saw the country attract US$106.8 billion in FDI capital into the renewable energy industry.During their meetings with the Vietnamese leaders in Turkey and the UAE, the CEOs of Equinor of Norway, International Holdings Company of the UAE, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners of Denmark, and Enterprize Energy of the UK showed their keen interest in the Vietnamese market.For example, Equinor, Norway's largest energy corporation, has begun operation in the Vietnamese market by opening its office in Hanoi. The firm aims to promote ties with the Vietnam National Oil and Gas Group (PVN) to develop offshore wind power projects domestically.Meanwhile, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has established a joint venture company and two representative offices in order to research and develop offshore wind power projects in Vietnam. Among them is the La Gan Offshore Wind Power Project in Binh Thuan province which boasts a total expected investment capital of up to US$10.5 billion.Renewable energy is the only priority area that the country expects to attract investment in order to implement its green growth strategy. Denmark's US$1.3 billion Lego Group project which is being deployed in Binh Duong province is viewed as one of the flagship projects that marks a shift of foreign investment capital into the Vietnamese market.Elsewhere, the country's Gia Dinh Group, a reliable partner of global brands such as Nike, Adidas, The North Face, and Polo, signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in April with SEP Cooperative of the Republic of Korea, to build a carbon neutral industrial complex worth US$200 million specialising in shoemaking and carbon reduction infrastructure in Binh Duong province.Meanwhile, the management board of the Vietnam - Singapore Industrial Park (VSIP) is keen to pursue its ambitions to turn VSIP 3 in Binh Duong into a green industrial park to attract further green projects.Previously, HEINEKEN put into operation a brewery in Ba Ria - Vung Tau, completely using renewable energy to run the production line.Moving forward, Vietnam is making every effort to greenize FDI inflows by attracting projects that use advanced, environmentally friendly technology, with modern management and high added value. Businesses are therefore encouraged to consider investment projects that are consistent with the current green and sustainable development trend towards win-win cooperation. - VOV"

1344 ET – Secure Energy Services has gotten a leg up financially from the sale of assets, using it to build back some earnings, Jamie Kubik of CIBC says in a report. The C$1.15 billion in proceeds was better-than-expected for facilities formerly owned by Tervita. Kubik believes the market will be looking for increased visibility on the forward strategy for rebuilding lost Ebitda as a result of the deal, and expects steady execution ""will be required before awarding a meaningfully higher trading multiple on the remaining assets in the business."" Until then, he says he expects Secure to use its enhanced financial position toward acquisitions and organic projects in its portfolio, though this may take time.( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
1304 ET – Fitch Ratings 2024 outlook for the global oil and gas sector is neutral, ""supported by high prices and fairly strong earnings."" The agency expects oil prices to remain high next year, given continued curtailments by OPEC+, geopolitical risk and slower production in the U.S. But slow demand growth and spare capacity ""should be sufficient to absorb potential shocks,"" Fitch says. Most companies will maintain or decrease capex, and producers will continue to complement dividend payments with share buy-backs, according to Fitch. ( stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com )
1251 ET – Expected guidance on whether sustainable aviation fuel made of ethanol can qualify for renewable fuel tax credits has CBOT corn higher through midday—with the most-active contract up 0.9%. Should the Treasury Department guidance allow for the credit, then ethanol demand is expected to see a large boost, in turn buoying underlying corn demand. The Renewable Fuels Association calls the potential decision a ""make-or-break"" moment for the future of SAF in the U.S., in a statement sent to the media today. Meanwhile, soybeans are down 1.1%, and wheat is up 2.5%. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1157 ET – If current trends hold, falling energy prices should continue putting downward pressure on inflation, which is moderating but still has a ways to go to get to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, according to Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. He says in a note that the sharp drop in gas prices last month has Americans feeling less burned by inflation, though that improved sentiment will only stick if prices at the pump can stay down. Individuals and households are still acutely aware of how much higher prices are now compared with pre-pandemic levels, and the resulting dent in their purchasing power, Hamrick says. ( dean.seal@wsj.com )
1049 ET – November's slight inflation miss knocked the steam out of an early attempt at an oil-price rally, pushing WTI futures below $70 and wiping out gains made late last week and yesterday. The month-on-month CPI number, at 0.1%, was above expectations for no change, and ""it just came apart after that,"" says Mizuho's Robert Yawger. The CPI report lowered expectations for an early Fed rate cut, and ""that implies to a certain degree that you're going to have a hard landing…you're more likely to have demand destruction,"" Yawger says. The market is awaiting the EIA's short-term energy outlook at 12 p.m. EST, which could also have played a role, he adds. WTI for January delivery is off 3.1% at $69.13 a barrel, and Brent for February is down 3% at $73.78 a barrel. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0939 ET – Oil futures are lower after getting an early boost from news of an attack on a Norwegian oil tanker in the Red Sea, with WTI back below $70 a barrel following gains yesterday. ""This pattern of failed rallies continues to underscore a heavy trading environment in which fresh price lows remain a high probability,"" Ritterbusch says in a report. With the possibility of the market shifting to a surplus from a deficit, the market response to shipping events is limited, Ritterbusch adds. WTI for January delivery is off 3% at $69.19 a barrel, and Brent for February is down 2.8% at $73.94. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0917 ET – Natural gas futures are down as overnight weather forecasts for the next two weeks are even warmer. NatGasWeather.com says in a report that it didn't think the weather data could be more bearish, ""but it keeps trending so."" While strong LNG exports partially offset the negative impact on prices of near-record U.S. natural gas production, until colder winter weather hits the U.S., inventories are expected to grow with below-average draws on storage seen in coming weeks. Natural gas for January delivery is down 2.7% at $2.365/mmBtu, but above yesterday's low of $2.294. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0705 ET – Pennon could see a negative impact from one of its subsidiaries being probed by the U.K. water-services regulator, Citi analysts Jenny Ping and Rory Graham-Watson write in a research note. Additionally to the investigation, the government has sent letters of warning to CEOs and asked the Environment Agency to set out plans to reduce sewage spills. These action underline the pressure on both the government and the regulator—Ofwat—to show a tough approach towards a highly-politicized sector, the analysts say. ""A dynamic which we think raises the risk going into next year's key regulatory milestones."" Ofwat's probing will likely find wrongdoings, given a resolution would already have been reached had there been none, they say, adding that an enforcement action can reach 10% of relevant turnover. Pennon shares are down 2.7% at 730.50 pence. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )
2028 ET – Oil futures edge higher in the morning Asian session on possible position adjustments after they ended slightly higher on Monday. Brent crude oil futures may find support in the $70s per barrel area, with price risks tilted toward the upside, CBA analyst Vivek Dhar says in a research note. These upside risks are driven by OPEC+ delivering its pledged supply cuts and stronger-than-expected oil demand growth, Dhar adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 0.2% at $71.47/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are 0.1% higher at $76.12/bbl. ( ronnie.harui@wsj.com )
1308 ET – Renewable projects in the EMEA region could face delays and challenges including higher costs of new projects, higher interest rates and lengthy and complex permitting processes, Fitch Ratings said. At the same time, ""operational projects are largely insulated from fluctuations in market prices through long-term, fixed-price contracts or regulated tariffs,"" Fitch said. Pressure on supply chains along with critical mineral supplies are likely to remain a pressure point, according to Fitch. However, the agency said it has a neutral outlook on the sector in 2024, ""despite persisting market price volatility, cost increases, regulatory barriers or lack of policy support affecting new capacity.""

1138 ET – Pembina Pipeline has a long runway of growth, Scotiabank analysts Robert Hope says. In a report, the analyst says that while adjusted Ebitda is largely in line with expectations, but are driven by tailwinds such as higher volumes at its conventional pipeline and gas processing assets. Meanwhile, he says that management sees the potential for mid-single digit annual volume growth over the next several years which ""should improve returns on existing assets as well as generate incremental expansion opportunities.""

1137 ET – SSE shares have had a strong run in the year so far, up 8.2%, but the current valuation seems to have priced in the U.K. utility's growth plans to 2032, leaving little further upside, UBS analyst Mark Freshney writes in a research note. ""The key debate, in our view, is over the durability of profits from the gas storage and power stations, which struggled to break even three years ago, but now contribute around 20% of EPS 2024-27,"" Freshney says. UBS lowers its rating on the U.K. energy infrastructure company's stock to neutral from buy, and its price target to 1,890 pence from 2,140 pence. Shares are up 1.7% at 1,851 pence. ( christian.moes@wsj.com )
1125 ET – National Grid PLC shares are offering high-growth potential at a low valuation, UBS analyst Mark Freshney says in a research note. ""Electricity transmission capital expenditure in the U.K. has been accelerated following the 2021-22 energy crisis, and we now see sector-leading growth, which does not look to be priced in."" The analyst forecasts group capex for 2023-28 around GBP45 billion, calling it the best in sector alongside more-expensive rival, SSE. UBS lifts its rating on the energy infrastructure company's stock to buy from neutral, and its price target to 1,190 pence from 1,135 pence. Shares are up 0.4% at 1,064 pence. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )
0957 ET – Equinor's minimal exposure to fading refining margins and strong balance sheet offer more resilience to its shareholder distributions than its share price gives it credit for, Bank of America Securities analysts write. ""We calculate Equinor's net cash balance sheet position can be maintained into 2025 at shareholder distributions aligned to the peer group's average 10% cash yield."" Come Equinor's February investor update, however, the bank expects Equinor to not only exceed annual cash return guidance of $10 billion but also beat consensus expectations for around $33 billion in the next three years. Bank of America upgrades Equinor to buy from neutral and increases its price objective to NOK400 from NOK360. Shares trade 0.2% lower at NOK334.05. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0903 ET – Orsted shares are down 74% since their peak in January 2021 and this appears overdone, UBS analyst Mark Freshney writes. The shares no longer ascribe material value to future growth, beyond what is under construction and easily obtainable, he says. The bank believes Orsted can work to keep its current credit ratings and lay out a roadmap to reach DKK39 billion Ebitda in 2027, versus guidance for DKK20 billion-DKK23 billion in 2023. Current projects will benefit from easing supply chain pressures, while new projects are receiving higher tariffs, it says. UBS expects Orsted to cut capital expenditure rather than resorting to equity, dividend cuts or asset sales. It rates Orsted at buy with a DKK410 price target. Shares trade 1.6% lower at DKK336.90. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0710 ET – Orsted, as well as the renewable sector in general, should benefit from two prevailing tailwinds, Barclays analysts say in a note. These include a decline in the weighted average cost of capital—the average rate that a company expects to pay to finance its business—and evidence of rising tariffs, which gives energy producers more for the electricity generated at their projects. Barclays expects Orsted to face a funding gap by 2027, but thinks this can be met by measures including working capital management, asset sales, and a dividend cut and/or placing. The bank upgrades Orsted to equalweight from underweight and lowers its price target to DKK400 from DKK430. Shares trade 0.2% higher at DKK343. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0533 ET – Uniper's strong 2023 doesn't equate to a buy recommendation, UBS analysts say in a note. The German utility's year so far has seen a fast return to profitability, UBS says. ""Despite this, details of Uniper's potential return to market remain unclear, including the requirement to repay any excess equity… with no visibility as to how this would affect the minority shareholders,"" the analysts say. UBS estimates that the company—into which the German government injected billions of euros following the fallout from Russia's Ukraine invasion—owes between EUR3 billion and EUR9 billion but says details are lacking on a repayment path. Further, UBS expects Ebitda to fall significantly by 2030 from the highs of 2023, and reiterates its sell rating on the stock. Shares rise 17% to EUR4.56. ( david.sachs@wsj.com )
1943 ET – Oil futures edge higher in early morning Asian session in possible position adjustments. Some stability has emerged as Russia and Saudi Arabia recently provided verbal support, emphasizing continuing efforts to stabilize global oil markets via active supply management, says Ole Hansen, head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, in an email. Also, the risk of an emergency OPEC+ meeting being called should crude oil prices fall further has helped to underpin markets, Hansen adds. Front-month WTI crude oil futures are up 0.3% at $71.46/bbl; front-month Brent crude oil futures are 0.4% higher at $76.16/bbl. ( ronnie.harui@wsj.com )
1727 ET – A combination of Woodside and Santos has merit, says Citi, but shareholders should be alert to risks to their growth projects in Australia. In a note, Citi says Santos shareholders could inherit risk from Woodside's Scarborough natural-gas project. ""We think the Santos share price pays 0% for Barossa and the Woodside share price 90% for Scarborough at US$70 oil,"" says Citi. This is despite the two projects having the same risk profile. ""Santos shareholders would therefore bear the risk that a Barossa-style court challenge impacts Scarborough, which is quite plausible,"" Citi says. ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)
1648 ET – Woodside will likely need to offer a premium to acquire Santos, says Macquarie. So far, the jury is out and Woodside may simply be acting opportunistically given Santos's Barossa project has suffered setbacks in the courts. ""Our valuations suggest a Woodside:Santos scrip ratio should be in the order of 0.31 (a long way from the last close ratio of 0.23),"" Macquarie says in a note. ""This is because Santos shares are far more heavily discounted, pricing in US$53/BOE into perpetuity."" In contrast, Woodside's shares imply an oil price of US$65/BOE, it says. ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)
1642 ET – Woodside may not have a clear run at acquiring Santos, reckons Macquarie. Talks over a deal are underway and Macquarie expects this will trigger interest in Santos from other parties, given it owns attractive assets at a discounted value, particularly in Papua New Guinea. The bank also thinks that Santos will now speed up its evaluation of other options, such as breaking itself up. ""It is not lost on us that Santos's share price is now virtually identical to the Harbour takeover proposal in 2018 that was rejected by the board,"" despite the stock being more valuable, Macquarie says. It retains an outperform call on Santos. ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)"

| Jump to first hitLabour cooperation is an important field that helps connect the two economies and bolster the comprehensive collaboration between Vietnam and the UAE, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh has said. Receiving the UAE Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation Abdulrahman Abdulmannan Al-Awar in Dubai on December 1 as part of the working trip to the UAE, PM Chinh spoke highly of the working session between Vietnamese Minister of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs Dao Ngoc Dung and Abdulrahman Abdulmannan Al-Awar, and the signing of an MoU on labour cooperation between the two sides. Chinh said the MoU helps complete a legal framework for both countries to step up collaboration in the field, and better ensure the legitimate rights of Vietnamese workers in the UAE. He suggested the UAE side join hands with the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MoLISA) to evaluate the UAE's labour demand, and build a labour cooperation plan based on Vietnam's labour structure, sectors that the UAE is in need of workers, requirements on labour quality, and periods of implementation.The PM asked the UAE Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation to assist Vietnam in training workers in not only skills and professional ethnics but also the culture, practice and regulations of the UAE.Abdulrahman Abdulmannan Al-Awar, for his part, said the UAE has high demand for migrant workers, and affirmed that Vietnamese labourers have made significant contributions to the country's labour market.Agreeing with PM Chinh's recommendations, he said he will work together with the MoLISA to outline specific plans to bring more Vietnamese workers to the UAE, and suggested helping vocational centres in Vietnam with human resources training, especially in foreign language, regulations and culture.On December 2, PM Chinh hosted receptions for several leaders of economic groups specialising in energy, infrastructure and technology.Meeting with leaders of Equinor energy company headquartered in Norway, PM Chinh welcomed the firm's intention to cooperate with Vietnamese partners to develop renewable energy in the country. He asked Equinor to work closely with Vietnamese partners to study the development of renewable energy in Vietnam, focusing on the energy sources and transmission. The Government leader affirmed that Vietnam always protects legitimate rights and interests of, and creates favourable conditions for foreign investors, including Equinor, to do business in the country in the spirit of harmonised benefits, shared risks.Equinor leaders said the company wants to branch out offshore wind power in Vietnam, and hopes that the Southeast Asian country will complete legal institutions to facilitate its investment.Chinh also met with the UAE Minister of State for Foreign Trade Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, who is also a member of the management board of the Abu Dhabi Ports Group, and several other executives of the group. At the meeting, the business executives said Abu Dhabi Ports Group is a subsidiary of the conglomerate IHC, which has invested in Vietnam through TTEK Company in the fields of customs technologies, and digital payment solutions.The IHC wants to expand investment in the country in seaports, logistics, digital transformation, smart urban areas and non-tariff zones, they said.PM Chinh said infrastructure development is among the three breakthroughs that Vietnam is carrying out to boost its socio-economy, so the country welcomes the IHC's investments, especially those in seaports and logistics infrastructure.He took the occasion to thank the group for supporting Vietnam in the implementation of several digital transformation projects, saying Vietnam looks forward to the group's investment in science-technology, research and development activities, innovation, among others. - VNA"

0850 ET – European capital-goods companies such as Siemens, Schneider Electric, Vestas Wind Systems and Nordex stand to gain from structurally higher demand due to the energy transition, more pervasive electrification, and the need for more energy efficiency, Deutsche Bank Research says. Global structural problems that relate to climate change, energy security and de-risking of supply chains can only be solved by massive investments in low carbon solutions, electrification, and energy efficiency and digitalization, Deutsche Bank Research analysts say in a note. Siemens and Schneider would benefit the most from these trends, along with Vestas and Nordex, in light of their positive momentum, according to DB Research. Among smaller companies, DB Research sees compelling valuations for Kion Group and Accelleron Industries. ( nina.kienle@wsj.com )
0417 ET – Citi thinks Equinor's Capital Markets Day on Feb. 7 will see the market look to reassess the increasing maturity of the company's core oil and gas business, with volume declines of 1%-5% a year in this business looking likely from 2026, analyst Alastair Syme writes. This reassessment could happen in conjunction with a period of uncertainty for the shares as the company signals its intentions to accelerate diversification into renewable energy and low-carbon solutions. The market could look to apply a more substantial discount on the company's valuation multiple, the bank says. Citi opens a downside 90-day catalyst watch on Equinor. Shares trade 0.6% higher at NOK330.80. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
1126 ET – Brenntag enacting major changes, like a break-up of its businesses, appears to be off the table until at least 2026, Jefferies analysts Chris Counihan and Charlie Bentley say in a research note. The German chemical company seemingly defers any potential business separation as it instead focuses on reorganizing its divisions. Starting from 1Q24, its pharma activities will be transferred to Brenntag's specialties division whilst its water-treatment and finished-lubricants business will move to essentials. This results in essentials accounting for 70% of the group's gross profit and specialties 30%, enabling Brenntag to be ready for next strategic steps by 2026, Jefferies analysts say. Shares trade 1.5% higher to EUR79.52 ( nina.kienle@wsj.com )"

1500 ET – Natural gas prices make a slight recovery after the EIA reports a large draw on storage last week. Natural gas for January delivery settles up 2 cents or 0.6% at $2.585/mmBtu. The EIA said inventories fell by 117 Bcf in the week ended Dec. 1 to 3,719 Bcf, although stocks were 7.3% above their year-earlier level and 6.7% above the five-year average for the week. A draw of 110 Bcf was expected in a Wall Street Journal survey. The storage report gave prices a little help, but ""at the end of the day, the weather factor remains as the primary driver of gas pricing with importance increasing with the official arrival of winter in a couple of weeks,"" Ritterbusch says in a report. Weather forecasts are pointing to milder-than-usual temperatures for the first three weeks of December. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )

0820 ET – The oil industry's strategy to duly follow market demand for higher returns to shareholders hasn't worked, and it is time for the industry to be bolder, Citi analysts write in a research note. Global integrated oil companies have essentially the same valuation multiples as in 4Q 2019 save for one notable exception—Texas-based ConocoPhillips, which chose to build its business through merger and acquisitions—the analysts say. ""The message is that building businesses has been rewarded, not building businesses has not,"" the analysts say. The sector's record-low financial leverage could offer an impetus to accelerate or look for M&A opportunities, they say. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )

0816 ET – BP's current share value underestimates the business, RBC Capital Markets analysts write in a research note, adding the oil-and-gas major to its Global Energy Best Ideas list. ""We see multiple potential catalysts on the horizon, including the credit rating upgrade BP has been seeking and CEO confirmation, which we think will be current interim CEO Murray Auchincloss, and taken positively,"" the analysts say. As such, the risk-reward is set up more positively for the U.K. fossil-fuel company, and with sentiment having turned much more negatively recently, RBC sees an attractive opportunity for investors, the Canadian bank says. Shares in BP are down 0.4% at 464.05 pence. ( christian.moess@wsj.com )

0417 ET – Citi thinks Equinor's Capital Markets Day on Feb. 7 will see the market look to reassess the increasing maturity of the company's core oil and gas business, with volume declines of 1%-5% a year in this business looking likely from 2026, analyst Alastair Syme writes.

0355 ET – An explosion at Sudan's sole petroleum refinery heightens fears of domestic fuel supply disruption in the oil-rich but crisis-stricken nation, says Sudan's military. The 100,000 barrels-a-day plant has been ruined by a series of explosions in recent weeks leaving it unable to produce any refined fuel products amid a deadly battle for power between Sudan's top generals. Sudan, the second smallest producer in the OPEC coalition pumps around 60,000 barrels per day of crude oil, but pipelines that straddle its vast territory are the sole export route for crude shipments from its southern neighbour, South Sudan. It's the latest blow for Sudan's industry, weeks after the militia group, Rapid Support Forces, seized control of the 22,000 barrel-per-day Belila oilfield. ( nicholas.bariyo@wsj.com )"

1448 ET – Natural gas futures for December post a second straight weekly loss as warmer than normal weather continued across much of the US and gas storage rose more than expected. The December contract settles down 3.3% at $2.960/mmBtu and is 2.4% lower than a week ago. Expectations for cooler weather in the Northeast going into the weekend were pushed back a day, with NatGasWeather.com noting in a report that forecast models saw ""wild swings all week."" Today's selling was mostly due to the above-estimate 60 Bfc build in gas storage last week, the forecaster adds. Next week's EIA storage report is due at 12 p.m. ET Wednesday, a day early because of the Thanksgiving holiday. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
1420 ET – Schlumberger's geographic diversity and product offerings should boost operating performance over the next two years, according to a report by S&P Global Ratings. Recovering commodity prices and increased capital spending by energy companies has been a boon for the oilfield services company over the last nine months but S&PGR forecasts U.S. activity levels in 2024 will be flat to modestly up. It says Schlumberger's offshore and international markets could make up for the domestic slump, lifting operational performance and debt repayment. In turn, this should help improve the company's credit metrics over the next two years. S&PGR revises Schlumberger's outlook to positive from stable. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
1334 ET – The number of rigs drilling for oil in the US rose by six this week to 500, rising for the first time in three weeks, while rigs for natural gas were down by four at 114, oil services company Baker Hughes reports. The oil-rig count is down by 123 from 623 a year earlier. While higher oil prices are an incentive for producers to raise output, producers cut drilling activity and production during periods of low prices, the EIA says in a report. Producers are more responsive to price decreases than increases, EIA notes. December oil futures are gaining after yesterday's selloff to a 4-month low and are up 3.7% at $75.62, but still facing a fourth straight week of declines. Natural gas for December is down 4.7% at $2.917/mmBtu. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0914 ET – Crude oil futures are recovering some of the previous day's losses while concerns about weak demand and a big recent build in inventories continue to weigh on the market. WTI for December is up 1.5% at $74.02 after falling nearly 5% yesterday to a 4-month low. ""The downward trend remains in place and more selling should be expected, despite relief rallies,"" says Spartan Capital's Peter Cardillo in a note. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0905 ET – Natural gas futures are adding to yesterday's losses prompted by EIA's report of a bigger-than-expected increase in storage. The December contract is off 1.7% at $3.010/mmBtu. Prices have moved below their week-ago level of $3.033 after warmer than normal weather and the storage report wiped out earlier gains. The market is looking for colder weather ahead to support demand. ""Futures seem resilient to remain above the 2.90 area as there is a lot of winter still in front of this market,"" BOK Financial's Dennis Kissler says in a note. ( anthony.harrup@wsj.com )
0740 ET – Who Enerflex chooses as the next CFO will determine how well the company integrates its acquisition of Exterran. Enerflex is consolidating its manufacturing footprint from five facilities to three with the closure of its Singapore and Sharjah, UAE facilities. RBC analyst Keith Mackey says in a report that since the resignation of its CFO in October, Enerflex is searching for a CFO with experience in merger integration and international finance operations. So far, the company has realized about US$50 million of the US$60 million of its stated synergies target. The analyst says the integration of office staff and international sales forces is complete, and integration costs should drop to about $25 million next year. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0644 ET – Citi opens a three-month positive catalyst watch on Orsted, with the bank expecting some short-term positive events, analyst Jenny Ping writes. The U.K. autumn statement could extend rules allowing the 50% expensing of investments for tax purposes, while Orsted could move to final investment decision on the U.K. Hornsea 3 wind project before year-end and rebid some of the project's output to achieve a higher price, Citi says. The bank also says a dividend cut instead of equity raise could be announced as a stop-gap for the balance sheet. ""This is a short term catalyst driven view rather than a solid long term investment opportunity. The fundamentals of Orsted's equity story remain shaky."" Shares trade 3.4% higher at DKK314.30. ( dominic.chopping@wsj.com )
0326 ET – Weakness in the oil market is likely to make Saudi Arabia roll over its voluntary output cut into early next year, according to ING's Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey. Both crude benchmarks—Brent and WTI—saw losses of nearly 5% on Thursday following an higher-than-expected increase in U.S. crude inventories and decline in October industrial production. Extending cuts ""should help erase the expected surplus and provide some support to the market,"" the analysts say in a note, adding that ""there will be growing noise around OPEC policy in the coming weeks"" as the group gets ready to meet in Vienna on Nov. 26. ( giulia.petroni@wsj.com )
2058 ET – Oil edges higher in early Asian trade after falling overnight. Oil demand growth will likely remain solid and core OPEC supply low in 2024 after the recent selloff, Goldman Sachs analysts say in a research note. They expect supply growth outside core OPEC to slow down in 2024, especially in the U.S. The post-pandemic easing in supply constraints and higher-than-expected oil supply from certain sanctioned economies are one-off factors and unlikely to further boost supply growth, they add. The front-month WTI is 0.2% higher at $73.06/bbl and Brent is 0.1% higher at $77.54/bbl. ( sherry.qin@wsj.com )
1408 ET – While the near- to medium-term funding environment is favorable for international oil companies and independents, ""funding availability for independent producers in North America and Europe could face intensified pressures after 2030,"" S&P Global Ratings says in a report. Funding availability could be constrained by ""increasingly restrictive financed emission targets due to lender policies, regulatory policies, and net-zero alliance memberships,"" S&P says. Michael Altberg and Thomas Watters, Managing Directors at S&P Global Ratings and lead authors of the report, say ""while near-term impact has been minimal, the energy transition will have profound implications on capital access for the oil and gas industry over time.""

1121 ET – Danish fund manager Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners has begun construction of a wind farm in Vulcan County, Alberta that'll power thousands of homes and Amazon's growing operations in the province. Once operational, the Buffalo Plains 495 MW wind farm will produce enough clean energy to power more than 240,000 homes as well as Amazon operations, such as its fulfillment centers, and its second Canadian AWS data centers coming online in the province in 2023 or early 2024. Amazon signed a power purchase agreement to procure 415 MW of output from Buffalo Plains. This project is CIP's second investment in Canada following the Travers Solar project, Canada's largest solar project. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0511 ET – Equinor's CFO has stressed that delivery of low carbon projects would not be at the expense of profitability, while noting that beyond headline power prices there remain significant challenges in scaling up the offshore wind industry, Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets writes. ""With Equinor seemingly pulling back from some offshore wind investments, some investors believed that this could drive a reduction in capex into 2024. Equinor's CFO cautioned against this, noting that the majority of investments were off balance sheet and project financed. With Equinor nearly through its 2023 distribution plan of $17 billion, RBC assumes around $15 billion in distributions for 2024. RBC rates the stock at outperform with a NOK390 price target.

The bank sees a funding gap of DKK25 billion, which could be bridgeable through disposals or an equity raise. ""The funding gap is…potentially bridgeable without an equity raise. However, we see high degree of execution risk on potential disposals with low visibility on outlook."" A reduction in the 2024-2026 dividend could be helpful in bridging the funding gap, which would afford some earnings protection and reduce execution risk, the bank adds.

0526 ET – United Utilities reported decent first-half results, with the highlight being the better-than-expected earnings per share, Citi analyst Jenny Ping writes in a research note. ""Overall, we see these numbers as uneventful, despite of the better EPS in 1H,"" Ping says, adding that the results are largely of secondary importance compared to the main events, namely next year's regulatory milestones in May, June and December, as well as the U.K. general election.

The Eastern Mediterranean-focused oil-and-gas producer kept its fiscal 2023 production guidance and quarterly dividend, while development across its portfolio largely looks on track, they say. Berenberg makes only minor changes to its forecasts following the update, including a reduction in fiscal 2024 dividend forecast.

0323 ET – Oil prices are falling on Thursday following an increase in U.S. crude oil inventories. Brent crude is 1% lower at $80.37 a barrel, while WTI is down 1.1% to $75.79 a barrel. The EIA showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose by 3.59 million barrels over the last week to 439.4 million barrels, the highest since August. Plus, the U.S. administration said it will enforce oil sanctions against Iran, adding pressure to prices. ""While sanctions have remained in place, the U.S. has not enforced them strongly, which has allowed Iranian oil exports to grow this year,"" ING analysts say in a note, adding that a stricter enforcement and subsequent supply loss would be enough to tighten up the global oil balance significantly through 2024. ( giulia.petroni@wsj.com )
2022 ET – Origin Energy's takeover by a Brookfield Asset Management-led consortium looks increasingly unlikely to proceed, leaving the Australian energy generator and retailer with a couple of options to unlock value, Macquarie analysts write in a note. They think that the most likely route is to demerge Origin's utilities and energy units into separate businesses, potentially securing better earnings multiples. They say that maintaining the status quo is harder to justify, but point out that it involves lower costs and protects credit quality. Origin could also sell its LNG interests to fund battery and renewable developments, they add. Macquarie has an outperform rating and A$9.39 target price on the stock, which is up 1.2% at A$8.675.

I n 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt travelled to Albany, New York to inaugurate the city's port — a ceremony that featured 5,000 parading soldiers, 25,000 cheering spectators, and a symbolic ""wedding of the waters"".
The then-governor — soon to be president — celebrated the docks on the Hudson river as a source of well-paying jobs at a time of economic despair, and part of a larger project to expand the nation's inland waterways to commercial traffic.
Nearly 100 years later, the Port of Albany is in the midst of another transformation: hoping to reclaim a role as an engine of economic renewal in the region. The cause for excitement is its selection, announced two and a half years ago, as the first US site for making steel towers for offshore wind turbines.
A subsequent contract calls for the port to churn out as many as 100 state of the art wind towers a year. These would then be loaded in sections on to barges and floated 120 nautical miles downriver to a staging ground in New York City.
From there, they would be ferried offshore to wind farms being built by Norwegian energy group Equinor and its partner BP.
Megan Daly, the Port of Albany's chief commerce officer, explains the impact that offshore wind could have not only on her facility but the wider region. ""This could be a job for the rest of [their] life,"" she says of residents of Albany's
South End — an impoverished, polluted neighbourhood next to the port. But enthusiasm has been tempered of late by bulging costs that have cast doubt over the project. In October, New York state's public services commission rejected a request by Equinor and its partners for billions of dollars in additional subsidies to cover rising inflation and construction material shortages.
Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, expressed disappointment, saying: ""These projects must be financially sustainable to proceed.""
While Equinor and others weigh their options — including walking away — New York officials insist they remain committed to building an offshore wind industry. In October, the state announced provisional contracts for a trio of offshore projects that would be its largest yet. The governor's office also issued a new 10-point action plan to address the cost challenges. Its suggestions include indexing contracts to inflation, helping companies access lowcost financing, and moving to ""backfill"" those contracts that are terminated.
""We're in a situation where there are market dynamics that have created headwinds for many project,"" explained Doreen Harris, president of the New York Energy Research and Development Authority, to local media. The path to the state's clean energy goals, she added, ""may not have a straight line"".
But, despite these mounting uncer- tainties, offshore wind offers a chance of renewal for ageing ports and terminals along America's eastern seaboard.
European companies are centre stage.
Having built a world-leading industry at home, they are now leading the development of what the Biden administration hopes will be an American equivalent.
They have been encouraged by state and federal grants as well as tax incentives in the administration's $369bn Inflation Reduction Act.
Some of the projects are significantly further along than New York's.
New Bedford, Massachusetts, a oncegreat whaling town featured in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, is trying to reinvent itself as an assembly point for offshore towers destined for the Vineyard Wind project, half-owned by Denmark's Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.
In August, down the coast in New London, Connecticut, a German cargo ship delivered a first shipment of Siemens turbine blades to a terminal upgraded with $255mn in investments from the state and a joint venture between local utility Eversource and Denmark's Ørsted. Together, they are developing the South Fork wind farm 35 miles east of Long Island.
In Portsmouth, Virginia, Siemens Gamesa has leased 80 acres of the port for a blade-manufacturing facility that will serve a wind farm 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach.
Then, there is the 73-acre South
Brooklyn Marine Terminal site, currently used as an occasional overflow parking lot for the UN. It is to be spruced up with $250mn in investments from Equinor, and an equivalent amount from the state, to serve as an assembly point, maintenance yard and power substation for offshore turbines.
And, just 10 miles down the river from the Port of Albany, GE Vernova has proposed two factories at the privately owned Port of Coeymans. One would produce offshore blades and the other nacelles, the boxes that house turbines' generating equipment ""There are jobs for people at every level,"" says Kathy Sheehan, Albany's mayor. ""You don't have to have a fouryear degree.""
The state capital's port, which is more than 100 miles inland, is also the last navigable stop on the Hudson for large ships before the way is blocked by bridges and then canals that lead into the industrial Midwest. The port handles everything from scrap metal bound for Turkey to incoming Australian molasses. ""This is a port of entry, so a ship can go from here right out to the world,"" Daly says.
Equinor won three offshore sites off Long Island — known as Empire Wind 1, Empire Wind 2 and Beacon Wind 1. It then negotiated an agreement with New York state to supply power — some 3.3GW, or enough to power nearly 2mn homes. That contract is part of New York's goal of generating 70 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The state has also set a target of installing 9GW of offshore wind capacity by 2035. It dovetails with the Biden administration's goal of US offshore wind capacity hitting 30GW by 2030.
But New York also wants offshore wind to bring general economic development. The state's contract with Equinor, for example, mandated that the company help establish various links in the offshore wind supply chain, from factories to job training.
Richard Hendrick, the port's chief executive, says Albany is committed to the project despite the dispute between the state and developers. The project demands that steel plates — many made in the US — arrive by rail and are then rolled and welded in one facility before going for grinding and X-rays in another. ""It's going to cost more than maybe what we initially had targeted pre-pandemic,"" says Sheehan. She pleads for the state and the energy companies to hold fast: ""If we delay, it's only going to be more expensive for us down the road.""'[Albany] is a port of entry, so a ship can go from here right out to the world'

A wave of impairments is sweeping through the U.S. wind-energy sector amid high interest rates, inflation and supply-chain woes, forcing developers to put off projects and casting doubts over the industry's outlook.
Governments around the world have set ambitious targets to increase the share of renewables in their energy mixes, but their plans are now under pressure as wind developers face a surge in financing costs.
Orsted, BP and Equinor collectively written off $4.8 billion against U.S. offshore wind projects in recent days.
Danish renewable-energy company Orsted said Tuesday that it booked an impairment charge of 28.4 billion Danish kroner, equivalent to $4.02 billion, against its U.S. offshore portfolio and abandoned the development of two wind projects off the coast of New Jersey -- Ocean Wind 1 and 2 -- due to spiraling costs and supplier delays. Orsted previously flagged increasing risks for its projects in the country, citing the lack of favorable progress on tax credits. ""The significant adverse developments from supply-chain challenges, leading to delays in the project schedule, and rising interest rates have led us to this decision,"" said Orsted Chief Executive Mads Nipper.
The decision came a week before legislative elections in New Jersey, where wind turbines have become a top target for Republicans against Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's plan to have 100% of the state's power coming from renewables by 2035.
""The industry isn't in a good shape,"" said Martin Tessier, Stifel's vice president of equity research for utilities and renewables. ""I think we'll see a softening of long-term targets. . .and less projects will be developed in the long term.""
Project owners usually sign long-term deals outlining terms to sell electricity or secure subsidies before construction starts. Some are now lamenting that these terms don't reflect increased costs and say their projects aren't viable anymore.
Earlier this week, BP booked a $540 million pretax impairment charge on three wind projects off the coast of New York after regulators rejected the company's request to renegotiate power-purchase terms to reflect inflationary pressures and permitting delays. Equinor, BP's partner on the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects, booked an impairment of around $300 million on its U.S. portfolio. The companies said they are assessing the impact of the regulators' decision on their future development plans.
Other projects have been canceled. Earlier in October, Iberdrola subsidiary Avangrid scrapped power-purchase agreements for an 804-megawatt wind-farm project known as Park City Wind in Connecticut due to financial challenges. SouthCoast Wind -- a joint venture between Shell New Energies US and Ocean Winds North America -- said it would terminate PPAs for a planned project in Massachusetts due to a significant increase in projected capital expenditures and finance costs. Ocean Winds was created by Portugal's EDP Renovaveis and France's Engie.
Swedish developer Vattenfall said earlier this year that it saw project costs rising up to 40% and it booked an impairment for halting the development of the Norfolk Boreas wind farm in the U.K.
Germany's Siemens Energy warned of worse-than-expected 2024 losses in its wind-turbine business as it works through quality issues and ramp-up challenges.
""The economics of wind are proving more difficult thanks to higher costs of capital and higher interest rates,"" said Russ Mould, AJ Bell's investment director. ""The laws of physics are coming into play with regard to how the wind turbines are made. They require large amounts of concrete, steel, rare-earth-based magnets and lubricants to ensure they work reliably in potentially hostile environments, but the costs are going up, thanks to inflation, and this is taking its toll on manufacturers.""
Some projects are moving forward. Utility Dominion Energy on Tuesday received a key federal approval for its 2.6-gigawatt offshore wind project in Virginia. And Orsted confirmed its final investment decision into Revolution Wind, an offshore 704-megawatt project in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Orsted's CEO told analysts the company has confidence in its portfolio of European and Asia Pacific construction and development properties.
In Europe, policy makers recently released an action plan to address the sector's mounting challenges.

Orsted's CEO also told analysts the company has confidence in its portfolio of European and Asia Pacific construction and development properties.
In Europe, policy makers recently released an action plan to address the sector's mounting challenges, saying they are working to ensure faster permitting, improved auction criteria, easier access to finance and guarantees, as well as a more competitive international environment. The European Union's plan was welcomed as ""a game-changer for the industry"" by trade group WindEurope, which called for action earlier this year amid high costs, long permitting processes and rising competition from Chinese manufacturers.

Orsted booked a 28.4 billion Danish kroner ($4.02 billion) impairment charge in the third quarter related to its U.S. offshore wind portfolio and said it will stop development of two wind farm projects off the coast of New Jersey amid spiraling costs and supplier delays.
The news sent shares lower. At 0852 GMT shares traded down 21% at DKK268 .
The Danish renewable-energy company had previously warned of up to DKK16 billion of impairments after flagging increasing supply-chain risks at U.S. projects, while a lack of favorable progress on U.S. tax credits and higher interest rates were also sending project costs higher.
Since then, the situation has worsened, with further supply-chain issues, higher interest rates, and the lack of a funding adjustment at its Sunrise Wind project off New York's coast leading to the higher-than-expected impairment, the company said.
At the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects offshore New Jersey, Orsted said additional supplier delays have further impacted project schedules, leading to a further significant delay, while updated assumptions on tax credit monetization, timing, likelihood of final construction permits and increases to long-dated U.S. interest rates have further deteriorated the business case.
The company has therefore decided to cease development of the Ocean Wind 1 and 2 projects and expects to book a provision of DKK8 billion to DKK11 billion in the fourth quarter to cover contract cancellation fees that aren't already covered by the impairments.
""The significant adverse developments from supply chain challenges, leading to delays in the project schedule, and rising interest rates have led us to this decision, and we will now assess the best way to preserve value while we cease development of the projects,"" said Orsted's Chief Executive Mads Nipper.
However, the company said it has taken the final investment decision on the Revolution Wind project offshore Rhode Island, meaning it will now proceed to construction phase. Orsted owns the project in a 50/50 partnership with Eversource and it is expected to be completed in 2025.
Orsted said it will now begin cost-cutting and other measures to shore up its capital structure and will assess its long-term strategic build-out ambitions and financial targets. It plans to provide an update on this work no later than its fourth quarter 2023 results announcement.
Orsted isn't alone in facing the increasing financial challenge of building new sprawling offshore projects.
Developers are struggling to justify moving ahead with large, capital intensive offshore wind developments after facing surging costs from inflation, which has sent materials and services costs higher, supply-chain backlogs, and higher cost of capital due to rising interest rates.
This has put projects currently in development—which were agreed when costs were much lower—at risk of becoming unprofitable and forcing developers to consider the viability of moving ahead with them.
New York regulators last month denied requests from offshore wind developers including BP, Equinor and Orsted to give them a higher price for electricity generated from their projects off the state's coast.
But in recent days officials have unveiled a series of wind-farm proposals that would result in higher electricity rates for residents than previously approved plans, which has seen developers behind older bids moving to see if they can resubmit their plans at or near the new rate.
Orsted said Wednesday that it is awaiting details but this could provide an opportunity to rebid its Sunrise Wind project at a price level that reflects current component and financing costs.
Norway's Equinor and Britain's BP are developing three wind farms off the coast of New York and they said in June that they need to renegotiate power prices or the projects won't get financing.
Equinor last week said it wrote down about $300 million from the New York projects while BP yesterday booked a $540 million impairment. The two companies are now assessing their next move.
Separately, the company said its third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization excluding new partnerships—the company's preferred metric—rose to DKK5.17 billion from DKK2.97 billion, beating a company-compiled consensus of DKK3.86 billion.
The company still sees full-year Ebitda excluding new partnership agreements and provisions of between DKK20 billion and DKK23 billion. Gross investments for the year are now seen at DKK40 billion to DKK44 billion from DKK44 billion to DKK48 billion previously.

Soaring costs are pushing up the price of big wind-power projects, challenging the country's shift to renewable energy and potentially leading to larger-than-expected bills for residents.
New York state officials in recent days unveiled a slate of wind-farm proposals that would result in higher electricity rates for residents than previously approved plans. That has companies behind older bids rushing to see if they can resubmit their plans at or near the new rate.
The projects are among the country's biggest and are being closely watched because they show how a nascent industry that is key to the U.S. energy transition will work through the upheaval of escalating costs. The struggles are threatening delays in the current pipeline of projects, which analysts say could hamper the Biden administration's offshore wind ambitions.
""It's going to be a tricky 12 to 18 months for the sector,"" said Harry Boyle, a portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which invests in companies including clean-energy firms.
Some companies have already eaten multimillion-dollar termination fees to pull out of East Coast projects or written down investments because of rising costs, battering clean-energy stocks. Analysts say New York's attempt to find new price points acceptable to developers, regulators and investors suggests the broader market's adjustment won't be easy.
""Does the market have the courage to kind of pay these higher prices for clean energy?"" David Hardy, chief executive of energy company Orsted Americas, said at a conference in New York recently.
He added that ratepayers would ultimately be the ones ponying up. ""But the question is, like: What's the alternative?"" he said.
In New York, which has pledged to obtain 70% of its power from renewable sources by 2030, negotiations in Albany will dictate how quickly developers put steel in the water off Long Island or elsewhere, and signal how expensive future offshore development might be.
Last month, state regulators nixed requests by developers including the Danish firm Orsted and Norwegian energy giant Equinor to renegotiate contracts from as early as 2019, before their supply chains snarled and financing costs jumped. Separately, officials last week greenlighted new planned wind farms that would sell electricity at a higher price than their older counterparts.
The new group of projects comes with a projected strike price -- a cost index that helps decide residents' bills -- of $145.07 per megawatt hour of electricity over their yet-to-be-finalized 25-year contracts. According to the state, that is about 28% higher than the older proposals' average but 13% less than the rate developers collectively requested from regulators.
A spokeswoman for the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority said the strike prices could change based on federal support or additional costs, such as connections to the power grid.
New York's new proposals will boost ratepayers' bills by about 2.7%, or more than $35 a year, for the lifespan of the projects, according to state projections. The expected sum is four times more than what officials estimated when the first round of contracts was struck in 2019.
Some analysts and advocates warn that bigger bills could hurt low-income people who have faced higher energy costs from gasoline to heating fuel in recent years, dinging public support for offshore projects.
Orsted and Equinor officials say they are weighing options ranging from starting construction at their initially agreed-upon rates to walking away.
A New York official said that neither developer has terminated their contracts yet. Last week, the state requested information about launching an expedited bidding process as early as late November to backfill potentially canceled deals.
Firms such as Equinor and Orsted would have to pull out of existing deals to participate in any new bidding process, the state official said.
""Those developers have a pretty fundamental decision to make: Do we abandon ship here?"" said Eamon Nolan, a partner at the law firm Vinson & Elkins, who has worked on financing offshore wind projects.
Equinor last week told investors it wrote down about $300 million from its New York project, or roughly half of its value. Shares in Orsted, which has projects off the East Coast, Europe and Taiwan, have plunged nearly 80% since early 2021.
Other developers and suppliers have also taken hits. Shares in Siemens Energy, a key producer of turbines and other equipment, crashed to record lows last week after the company said it was in talks with the German government and banks about guarantees to back long-term projects.
General Electric, meanwhile, said in its earnings results last week that it expects to book about $1 billion in losses from its offshore operations this year and next.
""We know the industry is ready for a reset,"" said Chief Executive H. Lawrence Culp Jr.

The boss of Norway's state-backed energy company has said European gas supplies are ""in a much better place"" compared with last year, adding that repairs to its platforms will not interrupt supplies this winter.
Equinor, which has become Europe's biggest source of natural gas after Russia halted most of its gas supplies to the continent following its invasion of Ukraine, yesterday lowered its outlook for annual production growth from 3 per cent to 1.5 per cent because of maintenance on its gas and oilfields during the summer.
But Anders Opedal, the company's chief executive, said the work had now been completed, enabling production to ramp up ahead of the crucial winter heating season.
""We're back in normal production,"" he added. ""We don't see any read-over from this event on supplies. Our focus will be to make sure we have high production at our facilities.""
The comments should provide a degree of reassurance to gas markets, where prices have jumped in recent months due to nervousness about the war between Israel and Hamas, strikes at a Chevron liquefied natural gas plant in Australia and possible sabotage of a gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia.
Futures contracts tracking Dutch gas, the benchmark for global gas prices, traded at €51.24 per megawatt hour yesterday, well below the peak of €311 reached in August 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine but double the recent low of €25 at the end of July.
""It's a nervous market,"" Opedal said. ""Incidents and events around the world do impact the European gas market and we expect volatility but Europe is in a much better place [than last winter].""
While Equinor, which provides 29 per cent of the UK's natural gas, will continue to boost supplies, Opedal said Europe remained a ""scarce market"".
To bolster energy security, countries have struck long-term deals for LNG. Groups in France, the Netherlands and Italy have all announced deals this month with Qatar to guarantee 27 years of supply.
Europe has also topped up gas storage, with the EU reaching a target of filling storage facilities to 90 per cent of capacity in August, two-and-a-half months ahead of a November deadline.
Still, analysts warn that Europe is not completely out of the woods with gas storage alone not sufficient to meet winter demand.
Europe ""remains finely balanced for this winter"" and any unplanned large outage at a key piece of infrastructure or supply disruption ""would test the gas system's resilience"", said Natasha Fielding, head of European gas pricing at Argus, a price reporting agency.
""If something happened to rapidly tighten the global LNG market, such as a shutdown at a large LNG export plant, and both Europe and Asia got into a tug of war for available LNG supplies, then European gas prices could spike again,"" she added.

The offshore wind industry has struggled mightily this year, as multiple companies have canceled contracts to build projects in the U.S. as costs to develop them have surged. On Tuesday, investors got some good and bad news about the industry—pointing a way forward for offshore wind but also raising more questions about its near-term profitability.

The bad news came from General Electric (ticker: GE), whose business making offshore wind turbines has been hurt by rising inflation for the materials it uses. GE is one of the few American companies involved in the wind industry, which is mostly centered in Europe and China. GE built the turbines for the first commercial-scale project currently going up off of Martha's Vineyard. But CEO Larry Culp said on a conference call with analysts after 
 its earnings report on Tuesday that the offshore wind division is expected to lose $1 billion this year. It will lose a similar amount in 2024 but see ""substantially improved cash performance,"" he said.

GE has a backlog of projects that it's working through where the economics are unfavorable, but the company expects better results in the future. ""We know the industry is ready for a reset,"" Culp said. ""We think we can make a much better business with offshore wind, but we're staring at some challenges that we need to address here in the fourth quarter and in 2024, for sure."" GE is planning to spin out its energy business, including offshore wind, into a new company called GE Vernova, next year.

GE did get some positive news on Tuesday: New York state is investing $300 million in plants operated by GE and a company out of Denmark to manufacture wind equipment. New York's announcement was part of a larger plan to add 6.4 gigawatts worth of new renewable electricity capacity, including contracts with wind developers to add four gigawatts of offshore wind. Gov. Kathy Hochul says the new projects should be able to provide 12% of New York's electricity in 2030.

The announcement is a significant step at a time when offshore projects up and down the East Coast have been delayed or canceled. New York itself just denied a request from BP (BP) and Equinor (EQNR) to pay the companies more for power from two previously-approved projects in the state. Projects those companies have been working on for years could be in jeopardy, given that inflation has made the cost of installing them much higher.

Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, said in a statement that ""these projects must be financially sustainable to proceed. Equinor and BP will assess the impact of the State's decision on these projects."" Hochul also dealt the industry a setback last week by vetoing a bill that would have expedited construction of an offshore transmission cable in Long Island.

But Tuesday's wind announcement offers a potentially profitable path forward for the companies that won the new contracts. They include German power company RWE (RWEOY), French oil major TotalEnergies (TTE), a subsidiary of British power company National Grid (NGG), and privately held renewable energy company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.

The new contracts are at higher power rates than ones that the state and utilities signed just a few years ago, which will likely mean higher electricity prices for residents. In its release, the state says that the new projects are likely to add 2.7%, or about $2.93 per month, to the average electricity bill. A spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on how it came to that figure. The all-in development costs of the offshore wind projects are 59% higher than the development costs of onshore wind and solar projects that the state also announced on Tuesday.

Analysts at equity research firm Redburn Atlantic think the New York offshore wind deals ""represent a healthy basis for developers to proceed offshore New York, in contrast with some existing agreements."" In a very difficult year for offshore wind, they offer some hope for the future.

However, expectations of increased competition with Asia for LNG could push prices up, Equinor CEO Anders Opedal told the Energy Intelligence Forum in London, RT reported.We actually expect the market to be quite volatile over the winter, he said.We will do everything we can to make sure that we maximize gas to come through the pipes, but Europe will be dependent on the LNG supply, Opedal added.Equinor is the largest gas producer on the Norwegian continental shelf, and the second-largest gas supplier in Western Europe.Global gas prices surged to all-time highs last year after the EU reduced purchases from Russia, leading to record imports of LNG and efforts to cut consumption in the bloc, especially by industry. LNG became the main source of gas for the bloc, accounting for up to 35% of total imports. To offset gas supply shortfalls, the EU has resorted to taking in high-priced shipments of LNG from the US and Qatar, and increased pipeline imports from Norway and Azerbaijan.However, even with storage almost full, EU imports are insufficient to cover demand, according to Equinor.Earlier this month, the association of German gas storage operators, INES, warned that the bloc's most industrialized economy would continue to be at risk of gas shortages until 2027, unless it accelerates the construction of additional LNG terminals, extra gas storage capacity, or pipelines. - FNA"

| Jump to first hitThe world's largest offshore wind farm under construction has produced its first power.Dogger Bank wind farm, located in the North Sea off the UK's Yorkshire coast, has installed the first of a planned 277 turbines.As of 7 October, it is connected to the UK's national grid and is providing renewable power to homes and businesses.When complete and at full capacity, the wind farm will supply 5 per cent of the UK's electricity demand.How much energy will Dogger Bank wind farm produce?Each rotation of the first turbine's 107-metre-long blades can produce enough clean energy to power an average home for two days.When complete, Dogger Bank will have a record 3.6 gigawatt capacity. This is more than 2.5 times the current leader, the 165-turbine Hornsea 2, also in England.It will be capable of delivering clean energy to six million homes annually, resulting in yearly CO2 savings equivalent to removing 1.5 million combustion engine cars from the road.On completion, the wind farm is expected to be operational for 35 years and will be operated by Equinor, a Norwegian company better known for petroleum refining.The wind farm will be completed in three stagesThe wind farm is being constructed 130 km off England's northeast coast, where favourable wind conditions and a relatively shallow seabed make it viable.It will be completed in three phases known as Dogger Bank A, B and C. The developers have also proposed a fourth phase of the wind farm.Power from Dogger Bank A is now being transmitted to the UK's national grid via a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system - the first use of such technology on a UK wind farm.The project is also the first to use Haliade-X 13MW turbines - one of the largest and most powerful in the world - offshore.Dogger Bank will provide a significant boost to UK energy security, affordability and leadership in tackling climate change, said Alistair Phillips-Davies, chief executive of SSE Renewables - the project's lead developer, in partnership with Norway's Equinor and Vårgrønn.This is exactly how we should be responding to the energy crisis, he added in a statement.The mega-project is expected to bring long-term jobs, economic growth and energy security to nearby South Tyneside and beyond. It is expected to be completed by 2026.How big are Dogger Bank's wind turbines?Dogger Bank's 260-metre-tall turbines are almost twice the height of the London Eye and the same height as New York's Rockefeller Centre.When complete, the giant wind farm will take up an area almost the size of Greater London, making it the world's largest of its kind. It will be operated and maintained by nearly 400 employees.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who has faced sharp criticism in recent weeks for rolling back green initiatives, has hailed the news as a success.It's fantastic to see the world's largest wind farm, Dogger Bank, generating power for the first time today from UK waters, which will not only bolster our energy security, but create jobs, lower electricity bills and keep us on track for Net Zero, he said.Source: Euronews"

| Jump to first hitIthaca Energy, together with Equinor (the Operator), have announced that they have taken the final investment decision to progress Phase 1 of the Rosebank development on the UK Continental Shelf, together investing $3.8 billion in the development.The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) granted consent for the development of the field on 27 September 2023. Ithaca Energy owns a 20 per cent working interest in Rosebank.The Rosebank field is located around 130 kilometres north-west of Shetland. Recoverable resources are estimated at around 300 million barrels of oil from phase 1 and 2, with Phase 1 targeting an estimated 245 million barrels of oil.The field will be developed with subsea wells tied back to a redeployed Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (""FPSO""), with first production expected in 2026-2027.The Rosebank field will produce in excess of 21 MMSCF of natural gas every day, the equivalent to the daily use of Aberdeen City.The Rosebank development has been optimised to reduce carbon emissions, in line with the North Sea Transition Deal, with the FPSO designed to be electrification-ready. Ithaca Energy and Equinor continue to collaborate with government and industry stakeholders to pursue a regional solution for power from shore to Rosebank and nearby fields with the objective of minimising carbon emissions from production.According to Socioeconomic report prepared by Wood Mackenzie and Voar Energy, the Rosebank development is expected to lead to £8.1 billion of total direct investment, of which 78 per crent is likely to be invested in UK-based businesses. It is expected to support around 1,600 jobs during the height of the construction phase of the project, and it will continue to support approx. 450 UK-based jobs during the lifetime of the field.The following contracts have been awarded in relation to the development:TechnipFMC has been awarded an integrated engineering, procurement, construction and installation (iEPCI) contract for subsea production systems, umbilicals, risers and flowlines with an estimated value of $500 million derived locally. TechnipFMC has estimated that more than half of the contract value will be generated from local activities across the UK, with a large portion in Scotland.Project management and engineering activities will be performed mainly from Aberdeen and tree systems will be manufactured in Dunfermline. Umbilicals will be produced in Newcastle, pipelines will be fabricated in Evanton and the main vessel mobilisation site will also be in the UK. In addition, several other fabrication sites in the UK will contribute to the project.Odjfell Drilling has been awarded a rig contract, with an estimated value of $328 million including options, integrated services and other modifications. The Deepsea Atlantic mobile rig is scheduled to start a seven-well drilling campaign in the second quarter of 2025, and an additional four single well options are included.Altera has been awarded a bareboat charter and an operations and maintenance contract related to the Petrojarl Knarr FPSO which is set to be deployed for Rosebank on a firm contract for nine years, with options up to a total of 25 years.Gilad Myerson, Executive Chairman, Ithaca Energy, commented: ""We are delighted to announce the decision to move forward with the Rosebank development alongside Equinor. Rosebank stands as the largest undeveloped field in the UK, and with the receipt of development consent from the NSTA, we are now poised to embark on a journey that will not only provide critically important domestic energy but also ignite substantial economic impact. The Rosebank project will create thousands of jobs and contribute significantly to securing the UK's energy needs for many years to come.""Alan Bruce, Chief Executive Officer, Ithaca Energy, commented: ""Ithaca Energy continues to deliver against its stated strategy and demonstrate its commitment to investing in the UK North Sea. We look forward to expanding our working partnership with Equinor to deliver one of the lowest emission intensity assets in the UK.

UK regulators have approved the development of the vast Rosebank oilfield in the North Sea, sparking immediate objections from climate campaigners.
The North Sea Transition Authority yesterday gave the go-ahead to Norway's state-backed Equinor and partner Ithaca to develop the oil and gas project, about 80 miles off the coast of Shetland.
Development of the field has become a focal point of the climate debate in the UK, pitting environmentalists against
Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak as he emphasises energy security and affordability over green ambitions.
Sunak called the licence approval ""the right long-term decision for the UK's energy security"". His comments reinforced a recent shift in tone as the Conservatives aim to distance themselves from the opposition Labour party ahead of a general election.
Equinor estimates it will be able to produce about 300mn barrels of oil over the project's lifetime, the equivalent of roughly three days of global demand.
Phil Evans of Greenpeace said the decision was ""carte blanche to fossil fuel companies to ruin the climate"".
The decision comes a week after Sunak diluted policies to help the UK meet its targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions, saying he wanted to take a more ""pragmatic"" approach. He delayed the planned ban on sales of new pure petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 and said about a fifth of households would be exempt from having to switch from fossil fuels for home heating after 2035.
The move caused concern, including from his own MPs such as Sir Alok Sharma, president of the UN international COP26 climate change conference which the UK hosted in Glasgow in 2021.
Sharma wrote on X, formerly Twitter, last week he was ""concerned about fracturing of UK political consensus on climate action"". The Reading West MP said yesterday he would not stand again in the general election, expected next year.
Claire Coutinho, energy secretary, said her party would not ""play politics"" with energy security and that fossil fuels were still needed in the medium term.
""Even the independent Climate Change Committee has said that in 2050, we will need oil and gas for a quarter of our energy,"" she pointed out.
The Labour party, however, has said it would stop new oil and gas extraction licences because of greenhouse gases, but the GMB union, one of its largest donors, is concerned about job losses.
Neil Gray, Scotland's energy secretary, said his government was disappointed that Rosebank was approved without addressing its concerns that most of the oil extracted would be exported and ""not necessarily contribute to our domestic energy security"".
Gilad Myerson, executive chair of Ithaca Energy, Equinor's minority partner in the project, said the company had held conversations with all the major political parties in the UK.
""Most people acknowledge there will be demand for oil and gas well into the 2050s. The UK ... can either produce its own oil and gas or it can import ... [producing your own] gives higher energy security, lower CO2 per barrel, more jobs and a stronger economy.""
However, Caroline Lucas, Green MP, said: ""Locking ourselves in to get more oil and gas at a time when we know we should be phasing it out, is reckless."" Lex page 24

| Jump to first hitPLANS to develop the UK's largest untapped oil and gas field were finally approved by regulators yesterday - sending shares in its backers soaring and triggering a wave of green criticism.
Norwegian energy giant Equinor, which has a controlling 80 per cent stake in the Rosebank project, said the project will bring ""significant benefits"" to the UK, while minority partner Ithaca Energy said it expected the field to provide ""critical domestic energy"" to help the country meet its supply needs.
The two companies have pledged to invest £3bn collectively in developing the site, which could provide 300m barrels of oil and gas equivalent over its operational lifetime.
Gilad Myerson, Ithaca's executive chairman, told City A.M. that even if the majority of supplies were sold on global markets, ""the benefits of developing UK fields goes beyond security of supply"", providing jobs, tax revenues and lowering emissions compared to overseas oil and gas.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also believed Rosebank's approval was ""the right long-term decision"" for the UK, and that the country could not achieve net zero merely by ""wishing it"".
While its approval drew criticism from opposition parties, Labour confirmed it had no plans to retroactively cancel the project if it wins the next election.
Equinor hopes the project will begin production by 2026/27, however the project faces the prospect of legal challenges from green campaigners.
Green group Uplift confirmed to City A.M. it plans to launch a judicial review of the project in Scotland on the grounds the site is not compatible with the government's legal commitments to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Tessa Khan, the group's executive director, warned the UK now risks ""blowing"" its climate targets.
Activists from Fossil Free London staged a protest in Westminster following the announcement.
Analysts at Wood Mackenzie warned the project still faces ""major risks"" due to the UK's ""well-earned reputation for fiscal disruption"", with the windfall tax being introduced and then toughened - putting pressure on company margins.
However, the decision was welcomed by investors with shares in North Sea oil and gas producers soaring on the London Stock Exchange.
Ithaca Energy's shares skyrocketed 8.8 per cent yesterday, while shares in Enquest (7.92 per cent), Harbour Energy (4.31 per cent) and Serica Energy (3.54 per cent) also closed up."

| Jump to first hitAn Australian company that uses drones instead of human crews in helicopters to string high-voltage power lines between towers has banked $US23 million ($36 million) from global energy and utility investors.
Founded in 2018 by robotics engineer Cameron Van Der Berg and military veteran Chris Cox, Infravision has developed a system of electric puller tensioners, stringing drones and software that is used by electricity transmission network owner TransGrid and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) for aerial power line installation.
The company also raised $3 million in seed capital in 2021 from Ilwella, the family office of Rich Lister and mining magnate Brain Flannery; Luke Anear, the founder of $2.7 billion software start-up SafetyCulture; and Eytan Lenko, a tech investor and chief executive of Mike Cannon-Brookes' renewable energy not-for-profit Boundless.
The technology, called TX System, was used to restring transmission lines in the Snowy Mountains near Tumut that were damaged in the 2019-2020 bushfire season and also by PG&E to repair powerlines over urban areas north of San Francisco during the 2023 storm season.
Traditionally, power line stringing installation or repairs are done manually via utility helicopters.
Before founding the start-up, Mr Van Der Berg worked for Downer in north Queensland as an engineer in charge of stringing the high-voltage power lines that connected generators to sugar factories.
""As a young engineer who was trained in automation, [I found] the fact we needed hundreds of people in helicopters flying low and slow with their blades between the wires, frankly, didn't make a lot of sense,"" Mr Van Der Berg told The Australian Financial Review.
After a number of fatal helicopter accidents rattled the industry, Mr Van Der Berg called his mate Chris Cox, who was stationed in Afghanistan in the Australian Defence Force, with a plan to buy military-grade drones to automate dangerous jobs in the energy sector.
The Series A investment was led by investment firm Energy Impact Partners (EIP) which has more than $3 billion in funds under management, from investors including US gas and electric utility businesses Southern Company, Fortis, Xcel Energy and Duke Energy, as well as AGL Energy.
Norway's Equinor Ventures, the venture capital arm of global energy giant Equinor, and Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison (SCE), one of the United States' largest electric utilities, also participated in the round.
Infravision's system is designed to assist utility companies to complete the massive job of building millions of kilometres of new transmission lines to connect new renewable energy sources to the grid.
""There's over 2000 gigawatts of renewable energy backlog waiting for connection to the electric grid,"" Mr Van Der Berg said.
""The industry is estimating that we need to build 17 million kilometres of overhead power lines to connect all of this renewable generation to the grid ... the current alternatives are too slow and too dangerous.""
Before Infravision's drones were successfully hanging high voltage power lines across canyons and over homes, Townsville locals Mr Van Der Berg and Mr Cox managed to crash a €350,000 ($552,000) drone more than once.
The helicopters that Infravision hope to replace are capable of carrying a one-tonne payload, but the heaviest drone they could find could only lift 100 kilograms. After many failed attempts, and expensive crash landings that took the bootstrapped business close to bankruptcy, Infravision re-engineered the system.
The solution was to shift the heavy lifting from the drone to an electric winch on the ground which automatically spools the transmission line to the drone as it flies, enabling the company to use cheaper drones that carry a 50 kilogram payload.
""The winch allows us to do the one-tonne workload of the helicopter,"" Mr Cox said.
Infravision is the third start-up founded by Mr Cox and Mr Van Der Berg, who met a decade ago in a spearfishing shop in far north Queensland.
The two earlier bootstrapped start-ups, an adventure travel app called The Itch and Gym Key, an app that aggregated gym membership were ultimately shut down, but did lead the co-founders to meet SafetyCulture's Mr Anear, who has mentored them and invested in the business.

| Jump to first hitA £1.5 billion Net Zero project officially began today (September 27) with a groundbreaking ceremony which will eventually bring thousands of jobs to Teesside by 2027.
Politicians, officials and investors gathered at Teesworks in Redcar this morning following the signing of a lease agreement between Net Zero Teesside and partners bp and Equinor to construct NZT Power - with aims for the facility to be the world's first gas-fired power station with carbon capture technology.
Once up and running, 860 megawatts of low-carbon electricity will be generated which will be enough to power up to 1.3 million homes. Two million tonnes of CO2 emissions from the site will then be captured and moved 90 miles offshore to a storage site built underneath the North Sea.

After six years in the making, the project finally broke ground today on the site of the former Redcar Steelworks, with estimates that 4,000 jobs will be created in the process including when the construction of the facility itself begins in September 2024.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen opened the event with a cinematic trailer and look back on the steelworks site set to the tune of A-ha's 'Take On Me' that hailed the NZT Power and Teesworks as ""creating a new legacy"" for Teesside.
Mr Houchen first spoke of the many ""twists and turns"" that have led to the ground being broken at the site, with bp chiefs predicting that 3,000 people will be working at the site by 2025.

He added: ""I am very proud to stand up here and say we are delivering what we promised to local people following the closure of the steelworks in 2015.
""Often people think that there is a lot of political buster in these things, we have promised a lot and that is why it was so important to get to today and show that it is completely real... there is more to come.""
Mayor Houchen was later joined by Teesworks Director Matt Johnson, bp Vice President for Hydrogen and CCUS UK Andy Lane and Chair of the Tees Valley Business Board Siobhan McArdle.
bp official Andy Lane was the first to praise the project and the milestone it has reached and hailed Teesside as a ""world leader"".
Andy Lane: ""This is a project that is really close to my heart. It is a particularly proud moment for me to be here today at this significant milestone and to see the site begin to get ready for us to begin construction.

""There is a great vision for the Teesworks site here in the Tees Valley. It shows the ambition and scale of what could be done here.
""Teesside has been a world leader before, and has the potential to be a world leader again.""
Following the conference, Mayor Houchen operated a digger to break the ground at the site and was questioned whether there was previously any concern that the project would not go ahead.
This comes after concerns allegations of ""industrial scale corruption"" from Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald emerged in May of this year, raising questions of wether investors would back out of the site.
The Mayor said: ""There are always huge obstacles with huge infrastructure projects. Since we first attracted NZT to have a conversation five years ago we were still in competition with other sites.

""It was only in the last six months that we knew this was going to happen, so getting to today where the deals are signed and we have diggers on site we know nothing can stop this from going ahead.""
Whilst bp is now the largest investor Teesworks has now benefitted from, Mayor Houchen has confirmed that there are further deals on the way which could be revealed before 2024.
He added: ""At Teesworks we are at the end stage of two other contracts for major investors, so I would be amazed if we have not made more public announcements with new deals by the end of the year."""

An oil field northwest of Shetland, off the coast of Scotland, has been given the go-ahead to start pumping oil and gas, despite concerns from environmental groups about starting new fossil-fuel projects.
The Rosebank oil field was given the green light by the North Sea Transition Authority on Wednesday for owners Equinor and Ithaca Energy to start drilling, though this is not expected to start until the second quarter of 2025 with production expected between 2026 and 2027. London-listed Ithaca said the parties will jointly invest $3.8 billion in the field, with Equinor owning 80% of the project, and the remaining owned by Ithaca.
""Rosebank stands as the largest undeveloped field in the U.K., and with the receipt of development consent from the NSTA, we are now poised to embark on a journey that will not only provide critically important domestic energy but also ignite substantial economic impact,"" Ithaca's Executive Chairman Gilad Myerson said.
At its peak the project should produce 69,000 barrels of oil and 44 million cubic feet of gas a day. Equinor said total recoverable resources are estimated at around 300 million barrels of oil. The project is expected to take place in two phases, the first recovering 245 million barrels of oil.
The U.K. government said the project will boost energy security, with a direct investment of 8 billion pounds ($9.72 billion) according to estimates from Equinor.
The move to approve the site comes as the U.K. government looks to loosen rules around environmental regulations, for example pushing a ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035, though it says it is committed to net-zero.
""We are investing on our world-leading renewable energy but, as the independent Climate Change Committee recognize, we will need oil and gas as part of that mix on the path to net zero and so it makes sense to use our own supplies from North Sea fields such as Rosebank,"" the U.K. government's energy security secretary, Claire Coutinho, said in a statement.
At 0812 GMT, Ithaca Energy's shares were up 7.7% at 175.00 pence, while Equinor traded 1.3% higher at NOK351.20.

| Jump to first hitWind power is one of the pillars of Petrobras’ energy transition plan. Six months after announcing an agreement with Equinor to expand studies for the construction of seven offshore wind farms off the Brazilian coast, the state-owned company is now entering a project led by equipment maker WEG with the ambition to build the largest onshore wind turbine in Brazil.The state-owned company will invest R$130 million over the next 25 months in an existing project announced by WEG last year. The manufacturer’s idea is to produce wind turbines with a capacity of 7 MW and a rotor diameter of 172 meters, which would be the first of this size in Brazil. The company expects to start manufacturing the prototype of the new wind turbine at the beginning of next year, with serial production starting in 2025.The agreement between the two companies covers the development of technologies for the production of wind turbine components suitable for Brazilian wind conditions, as well as the construction and testing of a prototype, with technical and commercial compensations for Petrobras. Although initially focused on the onshore sector, the partnership will also include collaboration to evaluate the supply chain and logistics for offshore generation in the country.WEG, headquartered in the municipality of Jaraguá do Sul, in the state of Santa Catarina, manufactures wind turbines with a capacity of 2.1 MW and 4.2 MW at the plant.As part of the agreement with Equinor, Petrobras is studying the installation of wind farms in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Piauí, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, and Rio Grande do Sul. The investments could reach nearly $70 billion and have the potential to generate up to 14.5 GW. At the time, Petrobras CEO Jean Paul Prates said that the project amounted to an ""Itaipu of wind power."""

| Jump to first hitEquinor, the world's largest floating offshore wind farm operator, was attracted to Australia's rollout by the scale of the opportunity for offshore generation and ambitious plans for green hydrogen, which address a much bigger opportunity than the local market.
Equinor's senior vice president Asia-Pacific, for renewables, Ingunn Svegarden, told The Australian Financial Review she had been impressed by the ""speed and the momentum"" of Australia's offshore wind licensing process and green hydrogen plans.
Speaking in a break at the Offshore Wind and Green Hydrogen Conference in Melbourne, Ms Svegarden said: ""They're in a unique position to take that role. I think it's just fantastic to listen to the speakers ... talking about those real projects that are being built at the moment where many other markets just talk about it.
""So I think that's potentially an important offtake for, obviously, renewable [energy] but also for offshore wind in the longer term. And that's part of what's making the Australian market interesting for us because the market is bigger than Australia.""
Equinor, the former Norwegian national oil company, did not apply for the first batch of offshore licences in the Gippsland Basin in Victoria, but the ""clarity of ambition"" since the election of the Albanese government encouraged it to bid for licences offshore from the NSW Hunter and Illawarra regions, and Tasmania's Bass coast.
Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen told the same conference on Wednesday that consultation and planning for the licence applications processes for the Bass Coast would begin in early October and for Perth-Bunbury in late November.
Applications for the NSW Hunter region and Victoria's Gippsland region offshore licences are under way.
The processes for the NSW Illawarra and Southern Ocean (offshore from Western Victoria and eastern South Australia) are in the last stages of planning and consultation. Mr Bowen said the start of consultations for the last of the initial six offshore wind development zones announced last year put Australia on track ""to have all six areas declared by the first half of next year"".
""We aren't just building an industry from scratch. We are building an industry in which we want to be a world leader,"" he said.
Ms Svegarden said the scale of Australia's ambitions was important because Equinor prioritised markets that offered scale to help reduce the costs of building.

| Jump to first hitBy Prime Minister Jonas Gahr StøreYour Royal Highness, Ladies and gentlemen, we are now standing right in the middle of what has become Norway's electricity powerhouse.Ocean. Wind. Sun. Oil. Gas.And today is an important day.Norway puts all these natural energy sources to good use - extracting resources and producing energy that is sorely needed both in Norway and in the rest of the world.Trygve Bratteli was one of my predecessors as Prime Minister. He officially opened the Ekofisk field in 1971, at the very beginning of our oil and gas success story. Mr Bratteli was not given to exaggeration: in his opening speech, he spoke of seeing 'certain prospects' for Ekofisk.Standing here today and looking back on everything that has happened since 1971, I feel justified in saying that we can now see great prospects ahead.From this vantage point, we can also trace the contours of Norway's modern industrial history.For over 50 years, Norway's offshore oil and gas production has provided the world with much-needed energy.The industry has also been instrumental in Norway's development into a highly advanced welfare state, with a large degree of social equality and huge potential for further development. And a country where our aim is to ensure that the revenues and wealth we generate are shared equitably.And now we are writing the next chapter in Norway's energy history.Right here and now, Norwegian industry and new natural resources are being brought together in ways we could only dream of before. Offshore wind offers opportunities for a new industrial era. We are taking important steps towards our climate targets, and we are gaining access to new, clean energy.As a politician, I have often been critical of the claim that we are living in the oil age. It is more accurate to say that Norway as a nation is living in the energy age, where we transfer knowledge and skills from one energy sector and use them to develop other types of energy.Hywind Tampen is proof that technology from the oil and gas industry can be used to develop green, renewable energy.Many of you who are here today - people who work on offshore platforms and for Equinor and its partners, and engineers and suppliers, have long experience and expertise from the oil and gas industry.This makes me very proud. And it fills me with hope.On behalf of everyone in Norway, I would like to thank all of you who have kept going through storms, fog and harsh conditions and have coped with the absence of family and loved ones while developing this facility for the benefit of society as a whole. You deserve our warmest thanks.You have transferred your expertise and skills to new areas in a prime example of transformation in practice.Today is a historic day.This is the world's largest floating wind farm. In my capacity as Prime Minister, I meet colleagues from across the world who are now looking to Norway. Floating offshore wind power is precisely what the world is going to need in future, and Norway is leading the way.This is also the first wind farm in the world to supply electricity to oil and gas fields.Hywind Tampen has a system capacity of 88 megawatts. This is a rather abstract measure for many people, but it means that in the course of a year, the wind farm can provide enough electricity to power 20 000 households.The Hywind Tampen wind turbines will be able to meet about 35 % of the annual electricity needs of the Gullfaks and Snorre fields.This means a lot in itself, but in a few years' time we will see that it is only the beginning of something that is to become a major value chain.Hywind Tampen will cut CO2 emissions by 200 000 tonnes per year. And we know that every tonne matters. We can talk theoretically about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it is the actual figures that count. And this project will cut CO2 emissions by 200 000 tonnes and NOx emissions by 1000 tonnes. This is important progress.Hywind Tampen is also important because of its role in technology development. As people in Equinor have said to me, we will gradually be able to expand and scale up the technology. This will create opportunities for the Norwegian supplier industry. And my thanks therefore also go to those who have been involved all along the value chain.Our current circumstances, with high electricity prices and an urgent need for more power, make this a particularly important project. Both because we are in the middle of an energy transition, and because there is war in Europe and energy is in short supply for the first time in many years.Both Norway and the rest of Europe need more electricity.Whenever I travel and am asked questions about energy, the answers nearly always involve boosting electricity supplies, developing the grid, expanding energy efficiency measures and using electricity wisely.And if we in Norway and the rest of Europe are to achieve our climate targets, we should be using renewable electricity.As I see it, leading Norway through the green transition is far and away the most important task for the Government and for me personally.Today's official opening is an important part of this task.Offshore wind is a new chapter in the story of Norway as an energy nation.Our ambition is for licences for production of 30 000 MW of offshore wind power on areas of the Norwegian continental shelf to be awarded by 2040.This is equivalent to about 75 % of overall production capacity in the Norwegian electricity system today, which gives an idea of the scale of our ambition. Areas from north to south in Norwegian waters are being considered, so that all parts of the country can benefit from the developments. We have a formidable task ahead of us.The Norwegian continental shelf offers abundant wind resources. Norway also has world-leading expertise in offshore wind. And we have all of you who are working in the field. All this means that we have opportunities that are not available anywhere else - and we must use them to the full.There is already close cooperation and a high level of trust between the business sector, local and central government and other authorities. We know the direction we want to go in, and how to share the work.All this makes me confident that we can succeed.It is true of course that offshore wind is expensive at present. But by making a start, and providing the capacity to deliver, as the project partners and the authorities have done here at Hywind Tampen, we can make cost reductions possible in future as the offshore wind industry expands.Somebody has to lead the way and clear a path - and that is what we are doing now.And we are doing it in tough competition with other countries.But this is not a reason to hang back. On the contrary, we want Norway to be one of the pioneers.Floating offshore wind power is what the world is going to need.Norway has what it takes - both the natural resources and the expertise. This opens up major opportunities for Norwegian firms and experts and for the Norwegian supplier industry.We will develop Norwegian offshore wind power in consultation with the fisheries and other ocean-based industries.Norway has much larger sea areas than many countries, and can develop offshore wind wisely and in a way that will benefit everyone.Everyone in Norwegian society must have their fair share of the wealth created through offshore wind production. This means for example using it to ensure that jobs are available in all parts of the country, and that there are sufficient resources available to provide good schools for our children and good health services for everyone.Ladies and gentlemen,Hywind Tampen is situated halfway between the Gullfaks and Snorre oil and gas fields. We send special greetings to those of you out on the Snorre field. The subsea cable network now links Hywind Tampen to both fields.In a wider context, we are linking an earlier industrial success story with a new one.But this is not just a story, it is reality.The offshore wind industry stands firmly on the shoulders of the oil and gas industry.This position - a head higher, but on secure foundations - gives the Norwegian industry competitive advantages both nationally and internationally.And this is just the start for the offshore wind industry.Thank you for your attention, for your hospitality, and for the opportunity to see so much out here. And in particular, thank you to those of you who have been and still are doing the work, and will be doing the work in the future. On behalf of all of us - thank you, and congratulations on this important milestone!Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitThe world's biggest floating wind farm has officially launched today off the west coast of Norway.Fossil fuel giant Equinor is behind the huge Hywind Tampern farm, which will generate 88 megawatts (MW) of energy to supply nearby oil and gas platforms.The project - which uses a new technology to tie 11 giant turbines to the seafloor - has received mixed reaction from environmentalists.Though it will help cut emissions from the oil and gas fields, climate campaigners argue it's time to stop drilling for fossil fuels altogether.Whether oil and gas majors can or should be part of the renewable energy transition is also a deeply divisive issue. A new report from Greenpeace underlies how small a part wind and other energy solutions play in Equinor's portfolio.The Norway-based company invests just 3 per cent of its budget in 'real low carbon', according to Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)'s analysis of 12 European oil companies.How will the floating wind farm power oil and gas?Equinor partnered with other oil firms OMV and Vaar Energi on the wind farm, which started producing energy in November and reached full capacity earlier this month.The energy produced will cover around 35 per cent of that needed to power five offshore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea. These platforms are carbon-intensive, typically using diesel or gas to run their machinery.Electrifying them with wind power will cut CO2 emissions from the fields by about 200,000 tonnes per year, Equinor says. That is 0.4 per cent of Norway's total carbon dioxide emissions in 2022.Hywind Tampen comprises 11 wind turbines fixed to a floating base that is anchored to the seafloor, rather than fixed to the ocean bed - a new technology industry experts say is suitable for use in deeper waters offshore and that Equinor hopes to develop further.Norway is targeting 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power by 2040, which would double the country's current power output.The electrification of offshore and onshore installations is essential if Norway is to reach its national climate goals under the Paris agreement, Greenpeace points out. They contribute about a quarter to Norway's overall emissions.The country is tendering its first commercial wind farms, including three floating ones, this autumn.How invested is Equinor in the energy transition?As the world wakes up to the climate-wrecking powers of oil and gas, producers are finding their own ways to weather the storm.Shell and BP have increased their oil and gas production in 2023, backtracking on previous promises to scale back. Equinor however, has never deviated from a growth path, Greenpeace says.The firm, which is responsible for about 70 per cent of Norway's oil and gas production, increased its profits by 134 per cent in 2022 compared to the previous year, after benefitting from sky high gas prices in Europe following the war in Ukraine.Renewable power made up only 0.13 per cent of the firm's total energy production that year.And the clear fossil orientation of the business model is also evident in its investments, according to Greenpeace. Of the almost 10 billion dollars in 2022, $8.3 billion (7.7 bn) went directly into the expansion or stabilisation of oil and gas production.Like most oil companies, Equinor is committed to the goal of being a ""net zero company"" by 2050. But it maintains that even by this deadline, there will still be a need for oil and gas in the 2050 energy mix."" It plans to use carbon offsets to neutralise its remaining emissions.It's also set itself a target to increase installed renewables capacity to 12-16 GW by 2030, up from 0.6 GW last year. Large-scale offshore wind projects like Hywind Tampen are set to do the lion's share of this work.Greenpeace campaigners remain sceptical about Equinor and the rest of the dirty dozen energy companies, however. Only 0.3 per cent of the 12 European companies' combined 2022 energy production came from renewable sources, it finds. And only 7.3 per cent of these firms' investments last year went towards green energy.""Instead of providing desperately needed clean energy they feed us greenwashing garbage. Big Oil's unwillingness to implement real change is a crime against the climate and future generations"", says Greenpeace CEE campaigner Kuba Gogolewski.Source: Euronews"

Equinor announces around BRL 42 million in Brazil in R&D partnership with CNPEM, Unicamp and UFSC. Around R$ 22 million will be dedicated to the development of part of the infrastructure of part of the Sirius research stations, electron accelerator of the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM)Key Highlights:* The partnership with Unicamp aims to evaluate the properties of rocks in the pre-salt region, particularly their porosity, permeability, and behavior when in contact with different fluids.* The collaboration with UFSC will study the interaction of different fluids with reservoir rocks and develop a digital protocol for these samples.* The collaboration with CNPEM involves the development of infrastructure projects for the Mogno beamline, currently in the testing phase at Sirius.Original Press Release:Aug. 10 -- CNPEM issued the following news release:- Sirius, a Brazilian particle accelerator, will be a protagonist in projects with research centers and universitiesEquinor announced, this Thursday (10), the investment of around BRL 42 million in research and development (R&D) projects, of which around BRL 22 million will be dedicated to the development of part of the infrastructure of one of the stations Sirius research center, electron accelerator of the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM). The remainder of the investment will be applied in partnerships with the State University of Campinas (Unicamp) and the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), in research aimed at the oil and gas sector.The initiatives will assess, for example, the potential for improving reservoir simulations based on digital tools; the relationships between physical properties of different rocks from oil reservoirs; and the impact of interactions between rocks and fluids involved in extraction processes.“Investing in technology and innovation is crucial to optimizing the oil and gas sector, accelerating renewable energy projects and developing low-carbon solutions, in line with our global strategy. In this sense, we have been working to encourage the development of solutions that contribute to the efficiency of our operations, while stimulating science in our country”, says Veronica Coelho, president of Equinor in Brazil.“The development of research in partnerships with recognized institutions of expertise in their areas, such as CNPEM, UNICAMP and UFSC generate technical knowledge and valuable solutions applied to Equinor's projects”, says Andrea Achôa, RD&I manager at Equinor in Brazil.The partnership with the three institutions has complementary scopes, forming part of the “superproject” Sirius, with investments in the extension of infrastructure and research activities. Equinor, in partnership with CNPEM, Unicamp and UFSC, will use the largest and most complex scientific infrastructure in Brazil to deepen knowledge about exploration and production activities.The R&D project in partnership with Unicamp will aim to evaluate the properties of rocks existing in the pre-salt with regard, mainly, to their porosity, permeability and their behavior in contact with different fluids. The rock samples will be sent to CNPEM to be investigated at the Mogno research station, on Sirius, and compared to data collected at Labore – Laboratory of Petroleum Reservoirs at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, at Unicamp.“The partnership continues what we started in 2013, when Labore was ahead of two of the three projects between Equinor and Unicamp. The cooperation reinforces the formation of highly qualified human resources through the postgraduate course in Petroleum Sciences and Engineering, of an interdisciplinary nature, with joint management through the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and the Institute of Geosciences, with support from Cepetro ”, declares Rosangela BZL Moreno, Project Coordinator at Unicamp. “Joint research projects have had a positive impact on the development of new technologies that benefit the energy sector and consequently society”, adds Marcelo Souza de Castro, Director of Cepetro.Also to observe the phenomena of the different fluids interacting with the rocks, the collaboration with UFSC will carry out studies, from the use of pre-salt reservoir rocks, to develop a digital protocol for these samples. These experiments, which form part of another R&D project, will be compared to images generated using advanced microtomography techniques, carried out on Sirius. The initiative intends to improve numerical simulation codes for the flow of fluids in porous media, which is recurrently used in Equinor's operations.“The partnership with Equinor, Unicamp and CNPEM reinforces UFSC's commitment to the development of high-quality science and technology and its applications in industry, an important mark in the identity of our university. This project is especially relevant due to its high level of internationalization, as it connects us with a multinational company operating in a strategic sector of the Brazilian economy and with researchers from several other countries”, stresses Professor Jacques Mick, Dean of Research and Innovation at UFSC.The collaboration with CNPEM involves the development of infrastructure projects for the Mogno beamline, currently in the testing phase on Sirius. Designed for X-ray micro and nanotomography, Mahogany allows the generation of three-dimensional images in a few seconds and in continuous zoom, which makes it possible to study the same sample in low and high resolution.The experiments to be carried out in partnership with Equinor on the Magno beamline will benefit from the characteristics that make Sirius a state-of-the-art synchrotron light source, such as its high brightness. In this way, the researchers involved in these projects will have a better understanding of the fluid flow dynamics through the pores of the reservoir rocks, which contributes, for example, to advanced oil recovery.“This project will make it possible to implement a new experimental system in the current microstation of the Mogno line, with a view to obtaining high-resolution three-dimensional images in in-situ and operating conditions. In these experiments, the rock samples can be analyzed under conditions similar to those of oil reservoirs, during the injection of different fluids into the porous media of these rocks"", explains Harry Westfahl Jr., director of the National Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), of the CNPEM.About CNPEMA sophisticated and effervescent research and development environment, unique in Brazil and present in few scientific centers in the world, the National Center for Research in Energy and Materials (CNPEM) is a private non-profit organization, under the supervision of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI).

| Jump to first hitA register setting out the government's latest assessment of key risks to the United Kingdom has today been published as part of ongoing cross government work to better prepare the public and businesses for the threats facing the country.Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden has unveiled the National Risk Register (NRR), an assessment of the risks facing the UK. The Register outlines 89 threats that would have a significant impact on the UK's safety, security or critical systems at a national level.This latest version of the NRR is more transparent than ever before and publicly shares previously classified information about a number of potential risks. These include:Disruption to energy supplies following Russia's full scale invasion of UkraineMalicious uses of drones to disrupt transport and other critical operationsThreats to undersea transatlantic telecommunications cables used for internet and communicationsThe threat to global energy supplies is one of the new publicly listed risks in the 2023 Register. Dowden is launching the Register on a visit to Able Seaton Port in Hartlepool, hosted by energy firm SSE. It comes as the first of over two hundred 260m tall wind turbines is installed at Dogger Bank wind farm, which will be the largest in the world when completed by SSE and its partners Equinor and Vårgrønn. Helping increase the UK's energy independence.The Government has robust plans in place for each of the different risks and is also urging businesses, local government and voluntary groups to play their part in helping plan for them. By publishing an online digital tool for the first time the Government is making risk details more accessible and easier to navigate.The NRR's publication is the latest example of this transparent whole of society approach to national resilience, set out in the recently published UK Government Resilience Framework and National Cyber Strategy. It also follows the recent launch of the UK-wide Emergency Alerts system.Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said:This is the most comprehensive risk assessment we've ever published, so that government and our partners can put robust plans in place and be ready for anything.One of those rising risks is energy security. We've installed the first turbine at the future world's largest offshore windfarm, which will provide secure, low-cost and clean energy for the British people - enabling us to stand up to Putin's energy ransom.Visiting Able Seaton Port, the Deputy PM will see the enormous wind turbine components being readied for loading onto a specialised floating platform, taller than the Eiffel Tower, which has been created to install the wind turbines onto the seabed,When complete, 277 turbines will be capable of powering up to 6 million homes in the UK. The turbines include British steel manufactured in Wales and processed in Corby and Hartlepool.The publication of the Register follows the Government outlining plans to tackle various risks outlined in it. In June, it published the Biological Security Strategy to strengthen the UK's defences against biological threats such as infectious diseases. And we have also published the Resilience Framework, which strengthens the coordinating structures that the UK uses to prepare for emergencies.Deputy National Security Advisor, Matt Collins, said:A comprehensive understanding of the risks we face is critical to keeping the UK safe. This edition of the NRR, based on the Government's internal, classified risk assessment offers even more detail on the potential scenarios, response and recovery options relating to the risks facing the UK; ranging from terrorism to conflicts and natural disasters.SSE CEO, Alistair Phillips-Davies said:Dogger Bank is one of the biggest and most complex engineering and infrastructure projects anywhere in the world. Our progress here with our joint venture partners Equinor and Vårgrønn, proves that offshore wind at massive scale is now mainstream and will help turbo-charge the transition to the cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy system we all want to see. It is action, not ambition, that will secure our energy future and this project shows action on a massive scale. But we will need many more Dogger Banks to achieve our goals and we look forward to working with government to bring forward more projects at pace.Resilience First is made up of more than 600 major businesses operating in the UK across multiple sectors, providing the ways and means to drive resilience at scale.Resilience First Chair and Board Director, Rick Cudworth, said:We welcome the new National Risk Register - it's a vital resource to improving the UK's resilience and it really delivers on providing greater transparency as well as a developed and shared understanding of the risks we all face. Providing invaluable information, this document gives us the power to invest, prepare, and respond more effectively. With more detail than previously, and specific scenarios, assumptions and response capabilities set out, we encourage organisations and resilience professionals to use it to stress test and strengthen their own resilience as we all move forwards together.Head of Risk Management Policy at independent think tank The Centre for Long-Term Resilience James Ginns commented:We welcome the publication of a more transparent National Risk Register which recognizes the increasingly volatile risk environment we face, the imperative to increase our preparedness, and the pandemic risk posed by novel pathogens. It's encouraging that the government is committed to further assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities to acute risks. We look forward to supporting their work in identifying and assessing chronic risks and related vulnerabilities, especially in AI and biosecurity, in order to reinforce our resilience.Source: United Kingdom Government"

Crane ships and construction barges have joined the pleasure boats floating off the coast of vacation hot spots Montauk and Martha's Vineyard this summer. The hard hats working on them aren't there to catch some rays. They're driving steel cylinders deep into the seabed to build America's first large-scale offshore wind farms, a milestone decades in the making. Both projects are set to start sending electricity to the shore by the end of the year.
Public officials in New York and Massachusetts toasted the news last month when the first turbine foundations were installed. ""The windmills that will power hundreds of thousands of homes are beginning to emerge from the water,"" said Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald Mariano. Offshore wind is a crucial technology to decarbonize large coastal population centers, including cities like Boston and New York that probably wouldn't be able to go green without it. So, its arrival is a major milestone in the nation's energy transition.
But behind the scenes, the news about wind power is more sobering. Financially, the industry is teetering, with a parade of companies planning to renegotiate or pull out of contracts, jeopardizing plans for projects that were expected to provide electricity for millions of homes. Inflation is erasing profits, causing some of the largest energy firms in the world to back away. ""Returns on offshore wind are becoming more and more challenged,"" Shell CEO Wael Sawan told Barron's last month, just days after a Shell joint venture said it would pull out of a power contract in Massachusetts. Shell won't build renewable projects that can't earn initial returns of 6% to 8%, he said.
At least eight multinational companies in three states have quietly started to back out of wind contracts, or ask to renegotiate deals in ways that will pass more costs to consumers. Beyond Shell (ticker: SHEL), they include BP (BP), Denmark's Orsted (DNNGY), Norway's Equinor (EQNR), Spain's Iberdrola (IBDRY), Portugal's Energias de Portugal (EDPFY), and France's Engie (ENGIY) and state-owned Electricite de France. The projects those companies are building will collectively cost tens of billions of dollars to construct and connect to the grid. The cost problems they're facing make offshore wind a dicey investment proposition today, with the potential for substantial write-downs ahead.
America's pledge to decarbonize is at risk, too. President Joe Biden announced a goal in 2021 to have 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power installed by 2030, enough to power roughly 10 million homes, up from essentially zero today. ""We're going to make sure that the ocean is open for the clean energy of our future,"" Biden said last year.
Credit Suisse analyst Mark Freshney says there's little chance that the country will reach Biden's goal.
""We won't get there,"" he says. ""We might get to 15.""
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment, but other Biden administration officials dispute Freshney's prediction. ""The Biden-Harris administration remains committed to pursuing a goal of 30 GW of offshore wind by 2030, and we remain on track to meet that goal,"" wrote a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which handles offshore leases. Combining two projects that are now under way and 16 other plans that it's currently considering, the BOEM says there are 27 gigawatts of offshore wind projects that are in the pipeline. Most are along the East Coast from Maine to Virginia, but the government has also leased parcels off California and is preparing lease offerings in the Gulf of Mexico.
Offshore wind's arrival in America has been a long time coming. Outside the U.S., 64 gigawatts of offshore wind had been installed as of the end of last year, a number expected to double by the end of 2025. While Europe started building farms in the 1990s, the U.S. has been much slower to adopt the technology, and some efforts have failed. A project off the coast of Cape Cod, Mass., announced in 2001, ended up snarled in litigation after local residents complained about the turbines spoiling their views. It died quietly in 2017. Today, there are only two operating offshore wind farms in the U.S.—one off Rhode Island and one off Virginia—generating a combined 42 megawatts, less than 0.1% of global offshore wind capacity.
The problems with launching offshore wind projects in the U.S. go beyond obstructed views. For years, the cost of installing the turbines was too high compared with the power that those turbines produced. Europeans have been less sensitive to higher prices because they already pay a premium for electricity compared with American consumers, who benefit from abundant coal and natural-gas reserves.
A decade ago, the U.S. government estimated the cost of electricity from a new offshore wind farm at more than $200 per megawatt-hour, twice as expensive as coal, and three times more than advanced natural-gas-fired plants. Since then, offshore wind costs have fallen dramatically—more than half, by most measures. The U.S. is also giving tax credits to qualifying projects that can be worth as much as $26 per megawatt-hour, bringing offshore wind costs to around $75—about $15 cheaper than a new coal plant.
One reason wind costs have declined is that turbines themselves are much larger and more efficient than they used to be. Turbines that companies were installing a decade ago were half as tall and about a quarter as powerful as today, says Christian Skakkebæk, senior partner at Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, a renewable-energy fund manager that's a half-owner of the Martha's Vineyard project. That project's turbines will rise 837 feet, almost three times as tall as the Statue of Liberty. And because the turbines will be 35 miles off the coast, they are barely visible from oceanfront property.
Those towering turbines point to the industry's potential. Offshore wind can solve problems that other forms of renewable energy can't. Land-based wind power is cheaper than offshore and already accounts for 10% of U.S. electricity production, but it isn't feasible in many areas. Developers need to negotiate with private landowners for space and often face opposition because of visual impacts. The turbines can't be nearly as tall and powerful as the ones in the water. Wind gusts off the coast are also much steadier than they are onshore.
The East Coast is particularly appealing for offshore turbines. The water is shallow, and the ocean floor is sandy rather than rocky, allowing steel to be installed directly into the ground instead of having to rely on more-expensive floating platforms. The wind is consistently strong. ""That combination of robust wind and shallow waters could make Massachusetts the Saudi Arabia of wind,"" says Massachusetts State Rep. Jeff Roy, the chairman of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy.
Offshore wind isn't going to be the main solution to decarbonizing the U.S. power grid, but it solves key problems that have kept high-population areas from going green, says Skakkebæk. New York, for instance, has said its electricity will be carbon-free by 2040. For now, natural-gas power plants account for nearly 60% of its generating capacity. The state is unlikely to reach its goal without offshore wind.
The new, more urgent age of American offshore wind started at the tail end of Barack Obama's presidency, when the BOEM began leasing more large ocean-bed parcels for wind development. The agency has now approved leases on more than 2.7 million acres of ocean bottom, an area equivalent to a square more than 60 miles on each side.
It's what happens after leases are signed that has stalled the process. The gap between when offshore wind developers secure rights and when the first steel enters the water can run many years. The Montauk project that just placed its first turbine won its lease in 2013, and has since been navigating various approval processes. To get a project off the ground, developers have to wait for states to hold bidding processes to supply power to regulated utilities. After that, the permitting process to lay cables and protect marine life can take years, not to mention the possibility of legal challenges. In that period, developers face considerable inflation risks.
Companies now caught in the inflation trap are almost all from the other side of the ocean. The projects being developed along the East Coast may have American-sounding names like Commonwealth Wind, but they're backed almost entirely by European companies that pioneered the modern wind industry and have been working on it for decades. Outside of General Electric (GE), few large U.S. firms are involved. Denmark's Orsted is the market leader, and its stock the purest play on wind development. Utilities from several European countries have also invested heavily through U.S. subsidiaries.
Companies such as BP, Shell, and Equinor, known for oil production, have lately turned to offshore wind to decarbonize their energy mix in the face of government and investor pressure. With high cash flows from fossil fuels in the past few years, those companies plowed large investments into offshore wind.
As competition rose, bids on acreage in one section of the ocean off New York skyrocketed last year. Several European companies, including joint ventures involving TotalEnergies (TTE) and Shell, paid more than $700 million each for sections of the ocean bottom. The parcels contained less acreage than farms other companies had leased for less than $10 million prior to the pandemic, according to Freshney, the Credit Suisse analyst. ""The cost just went through the roof,"" he says. ""It was a bubble.""
Other costs soared, too, because of inflation pressures that have also hurt other industries. Steel is much pricier than it was prior to the pandemic, for instance. A consultant hired by the wind developer on Shell's Massachusetts project estimated that costs have risen more than 20% since 2019, and rising interest rates have added more financial stress. ""This is not an industry that is in a healthy and mature state,"" the report said. Another problem: The supply chain to build wind turbines is nowhere near ready to handle the influx of projects. Installation capacity is at 20% of where it needs to be, according to a study by energy consultant Wood Mackenzie.
Now, states are trying to manage the fallout. Offshore wind projects backed by Shell, BP, Iberdrola, and several others have already said they need to renegotiate the contracts, with the implicit—and sometimes explicit—threat that they could pull out. The new terms will have to be more lucrative for project developers, with electricity prices probably linked to inflation.
Regulators now face a ""huge problem from a ratepayer's perspective,"" said Ronald Gerwatowski, chairman of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, at a recent hearing about offshore wind. Developers can essentially hold regulators hostage by threatening to walk away from already-permitted projects unless rates are hiked.
Already, some states have agreed to change policies in a way that could lead to more-expensive rates. In Maryland, a new law shifts some of the federal Inflation Reduction Act's support from consumers to wind developers. Previously, Maryland law said 80% of the federal benefits had to go to the consumers.
New Jersey's legislature also just passed a law that will redirect federal tax money to Orsted to complete an offshore project known as Ocean Winds 1 that will supply enough power for 500,000 homes. Those funds were previously expected to go to electricity consumers. Republicans opposed it, with state Sen. Edward Durr calling it a ""huge handout at the expense of New Jersey utility customers,"" one that could cost up to $1 billion. Orsted tells Barron's that the bill denied each New Jersey ratepayer only about $2.40 per year, and won't result in a real hike in electricity rates.
After New Jersey passed the bill, developers of another wind project in New Jersey—Atlantic Shores, backed by Shell and French utility EDF—said they needed similar support. ""Tens of thousands of real, well-paid, and unionized jobs are at risk,"" the developers said. ""Hundreds of millions in infrastructure investments will be forgone without a path forward."" The governor's office declined to comment about the request.
Orsted is also talking to New York officials about boosting payments to wind developers based on inflation rates. New York's new contracts have mechanisms that allow for inflation adjustments, but the contracts that Orsted signed in the past don't.
""We sign multidecade contracts to sell the power at an agreed price before the project is ever built,"" says Orsted spokesman Ryan Ferguson. The per-megawatt value has to pencil out over a 25-year contract, but ""they're not doing so based on current development costs.""
New York officials say they are reviewing Orsted's proposals for inflation adjustments. The state is already expecting wind power to be more expensive than other sources. ""Electricity consumers across the state can expect to see slight increases in electricity bills to support offshore wind development once the projects enter commercial operation,"" says a spokesman for the New York energy agency.
Equinor and BP also have two projects in the state, and have asked officials to reconsider the rates they originally signed on for. The companies ""have seen the estimated costs of our projects rise sharply,"" said Teddy Muhlfelder, an executive at Equinor Renewables Americas, in a statement. The companies remain ""strongly committed"" to the projects, and are looking for a way forward, he added. The state is reviewing the request.
By next year, Massachusetts residents will be receiving 800 megawatts worth of wind energy from the Martha's Vineyard project, enough to power 400,000 homes or so. But developers of two other projects in the state that collectively were expected to add 2.4 gigawatts—three times as much as the Vineyard project—have attempted to pull out of their contracts. Commonwealth Wind, owned by a subsidiary of Iberdrola, just reached a deal with three utilities to terminate its contract and pay a $48 million fee. And developers of SouthCoast Wind, owned by Shell, EDP, and Engie, said last month that they're planning to terminate their contract. In a statement, Rebecca Ullman, SouthCoast's director of external affairs, said the company is still in discussions with utilities over the contracts and is ""looking forward to future [offshore wind] procurements in New England.""
Massachusetts just released a new draft request for proposals that could push the whole process back considerably, and allows for more inflation-related adjustments. Roy, the state legislator, said in an interview that he now expects Massachusetts' major wind projects to come into service in 2031 or 2032, instead of in the late 2020s, and be ""more costly.""
State regulators and utilities have fought some proposals to pay wind developers more, but momentum is building for these contracts to be repriced or rebid. That gives the companies a better chance to make adequate returns—though Freshney anticipates asset impairments ahead as higher construction costs diminish their expected profits.
Some companies are eyeing novel strategies to make wind projects pay off. BP CEO Bernard Looney said in an interview with Barron's earlier this year that BP plans to juice returns by integrating the power its wind turbines produce into other segments of its business—essentially upselling the electrons into its hydrogen and electric-vehicle-charging businesses. ""We will have a 10 gigawatt demand for electrons in our own charging infrastructure,"" he said. Shell's Sawan has outlined a similar strategy.
But even with those potential projects, the public investment case for offshore wind now looks iffy. Orsted, the most direct way to bet on offshore wind, has already written down the value of one of its U.S. projects. The stock is up 25% from its October lows, but it's too soon to signal an all-clear. The industry may be in the early stages of a bad-news cycle, with more impairments to come at various companies, Freshney says. Other issues loom, including protests about how the turbines impact whales.
Eventually, hundreds of turbines are likely to be humming up and down the coasts, and in the Gulf of Mexico, too. They will represent a step forward in the fight against climate change. Paying for them will be anything but a breeze.

| Jump to first hitROSEBANK, the UK's largest undeveloped oil and gas field, is highly unlikely to be approved in time for parliamentary recess.
City A.M. understands the site, which has to be green-lit by the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning and the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), is now not expected to be sanctioned until August at the earliest.
This will be a setback for both its stakeholders, Equinor and Ithaca, following industry expectations it would be sanctioned before 20 July when MPs break for the summer recess.
When completed, Rosebank is expected to produce up to 500m barrels of oil and gas equivalent over its operating lifetime - which could begin as soon as 2027. This has made the project the sub- ject of intense controversy, with climate groups and energy transition advocates calling for the project to be rejected amid fears it would jeopardise the country's climate ambitions.
City A.M. has learned that the NSTA has written directly to oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea, warning them of the importance of electrification for new offshore platforms.
When approached for comment, Equinor denied any concerns being raised by regulators over electrification and, while they would not be drawn on a timeline, they confirmed the project is still developing in line with expectations.
The government told City A.M. there was no organised timeline for the project, and that it remained in the hands of the regulators.
The NSTA and Ithaca both declined to comment."

| Jump to first hitProductivity Mining may be the nation's chief source of profits, but it can't be the answer to the economy's biggest problems unless it is properly taxed.
Australian productivity growth is very low. Wages are rising faster, and that causes inflation as unit labour costs rise.
The elephant in the room is the productivity crisis, not the Reserve Bank of Australia just doing its job.
We need to talk about mining.
Gina Rinehart says the solution for Australia's problems is to open more mines - and that regulation is strangling the mining sector's ability to do that.
The Minerals Council of Australia's Tania Constable is with her.
She links mining to the push for renewables, which needs lithium, other rare minerals, and steel - she notes the need for onshore processing. Australians need to leave it to the miners to take their birthright forward, which would happen if only government regulation would get out of the way. Oh, and no new taxes on mining super profits (she even threatened the government with a new advertising campaign like the one that derailed Kevin Rudd's government).
Let's look at mining birthrights.
The chart shows the mining sector's productivity growth (the shaded area of the chart) since the super cycle took off with China's entry into the World Trade Organisation in December 2001. It is mostly negative. The average growth since 2001 is minus 1.6 productivity a year.
Contrary to the rhetoric of the mining lobby, the industry is not a jobs driver. It is a tiny employer (barely 2 per cent of the workforce). But it has a large share of the economy due to profits.
It's productivity growth, therefore, weighs on the national average.
Mining productivity did accelerate around 2016. But it had nothing to do with the creative genius of mining CEOs.
Instead, they slashed employment by 20 per cent between 2013 and 2016 as China demand slumped.
Paradoxically, mining productivity rises whenever the mining industry demand declines and employment is slashed, and vice versa for mining booms.
But wait. Mining makes by far the most profits of any industrial sector in Australia: 30 per cent of the total on average since China's WTO debut, and 55 per cent last year. Perhaps that is the great benefit for Australia.
The chart shows annual rolling mining pre-tax profits and the percentage change in the terms of trade. These are pretty much a mirror image of each other.
The global price of commodities goes up and profits boom. They go down, and profits fall. Through no fault of their own, mining CEOs take credit for profits that are driven by China demand and global resource prices.
Mining investment is about digging holes and shifting resources to China.
No magic there. The negative productivity growth of the sector cumulates. Its level today is around 35 per cent less efficient than it was in 2001.
Mining investment is not the investment empowering worker productivity by machines, innovations and technology driven by creative CEOs. But the latter should be central to a strategy for using the minerals birthright to benefit the long-term future of a broader range of Australians.
But wait. The massive profits of mining give rise to a big tax take, helping the government do the good things for Australia. Maybe that squares the circle.
The chart shows the annual tax take. The rolling four quarter profits before tax to March 2023 added up to $235 billion. The tax take is approximately $64 billion to $70 billion a year for that period.
That leaves around $165 billion for capex and distributions. Mining capex was around $45 billion in the year to March, leaving around $120 billion for the owners of mining company shares.
Now, distributing this to shareholders could lead to it being reinvested or reallocated to other Australian companies. However, based on balance of payments dividend debits and apportioning the share of mining in profits suggests that approximately $60 billion was transferred to overseas investors in mining. The other $60 billion is presumably for domestic owners of mining capital.
To fund new industries and to provide incentives for onshoring, as the US has done through the Inflation Reduction Act, requires a lot of money.
Instead of spilling so much of mining profits (our birthright) in unproductive ways, a super profits tax could allow Australia to have its own version of the IRA.
A game-changing strategy. Leaving this strategy to the largesse of our mining companies, on the pretence that they can and will do the right thing by Australians for productivity growth and rising living standards, is plain wrong.
Doing just that has given us 20 years of waiting to see the benefits of the resource super cycle for Australian productivity, which never came.
Before 2001, aggregate productivity growth was a respectable 1.6 per cent a year. Since 2001, that number has halved.
What sense does it make to leave it to mining companies to develop renewables and new onshoring industries? They are companies with a geologist culture. Wouldn't it be better to provide incentives on a sufficient scale for creativity and innovation by experts with the right background and culture in the areas we need to develop?
This requires a reallocation of resources away from our profitable (but negative productivity growth) mining sector.
A substantive tax on super profits in mining is exactly the right way to get a broad-based new industrial strategy moving for Australia.
Norway understands what a minerals birthright is. Just one single company, Equinor, paid US$49 billion ($70 billion) to the government in 2022, more than the entire mining industry pays in royalties and taxes in Australia. Its effective tax rate is 64 per cent to 72 per cent. Aussie miners' predictions of the doom that would follow didn't happen to Equinor.
Instead, Norway built an enormous Pension Fund Global which reallocates mineral wealth. Currently, every Norwegian born has a birthright of $363,000 in that fund, compared with about $7000 for every Australian in the Future Fund.
So much for birthrights. The way to go is clear: it is not to open more mines by attracting foreign capital. By failing to reallocate resource profits to more productive forward-looking industries, we allow the future of young Australians to be stolen from them.

| Jump to first hitA YOUNG inventor is to see his planet-saving idea brought to life with the support of two South Tyneside pioneers.
Nine-year-old Isaac Usher, from Cleadon, visited Ford Aerospace at Port of Tyne to present his Wind Mirrors to a panel of high-profile business leaders.
The project was part of South Tyneside Council and the Dogger Bank Wind Farm’s Little Inventors Programme, in partnership with schools across the borough. The programme was launched in February as a challenge to year 4 and 5 students to create inventions powered by movement and wind that could help reverse climate change.
* Enjoy a full subscriber experience with The Echo
Isaac’s idea, ‘Wind Mirrors’, would see propellers manufactured that could be attached underneath vehicle wing mirrors to generate renewable electricity that can be used to power vehicular accessories.
As Isaac explained in his presentation: “The propellers will spin in the wind as the car moves which will then provide electricity, which will power the radio and satnav.
“This is also a safety feature because it can power the rear and front headlights. Also, the propellers are underneath the mirrors, so it doesn’t obstruct the driver’s view.”
Cell Pack Solutions and Ford Aerospace were two of the many local businesses to back the campaign, with both companies agreeing to collaborate to help bring one of them to life.
Both organisations were inspired to get involved having signed the South Tyneside Pledge, a commitment by over two hundred local organisations to boost local economic activity, reduce health inequalities, lower carbon emissions, and enhance civic pride. Equinor, Operator of Dogger Bank Wind Farm is also a signatory of the pledge.
Speaking after the presentation, Isaac said: “I spend a lot of time drawing cars and building this with LEGO, so I was really happy when I found out I had won.
“The idea was to use a propeller that can generate wind from the momentum of the car and use it to power things such as the sat nav. We have also spoken about using a battery to store the electricity but that would be further down the line.
Isaac's invention
“It’s been totally mad seeing the design come to life and seeing how the two companies have worked together on it and I can’t wait to see the final version.”

Tom Nightingale, North East Stakeholder Manager for Equinor, said: “Isaac is one of many little inventors with great ideas that are building on our work at Dogger Bank Wind Farm to start a green revolution from here in South Tyneside.”
Cllr Margaret Meling, Lead Member for Economic Growth and Transport, said: “This programme is an excellent way of inspiring children and igniting their passion for STEM not just in the classroom, but to find innovative solutions to real-life problems.

Oil and gas majors are stepping up efforts to break into lithium to diversify beyond fossil fuels as hopes rise over a technological breakthrough to produce the metal that is critical for electric car batteries.
ExxonMobil, Schlumberger, Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are exploring whether their core skills of pumping, processing and reinjecting underground fluids such as oil and water could be deployed to process lithium from unconventional brine resources, helping to ease forecast shortages of a material expected to be vital for the energy transition.
""There are a number of oil and gas majors putting a lot of time and attention into how they can become big in lithium,"" said Brian Menell, chief executive of TechMet, a mining investment fund backed by the US government. TechMet has a stake in EnergySource Minerals (ESM), a lithium developer backed by oilfield services group Schlumberger.
""It's a natural evolution for oil companies. Lithium brines are an obvious one as unlike charging networks and wind farms, where they have no skills besides project management, they are skilled at subsurface pumping and fluids.""
The potential push into lithium comes as producers from Exxon and Chevron in the US to Equinor and BP in Europe try to remain profitable amid a global effort to curb emissions and transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.
Oil majors' drive into lithium would reassure carmakers that at present rely on small, unproven miners to deliver the vast quantities of lithium needed to electrify their vehicles in the coming decade as western countries ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars and as electric vehicle use soars in China.
But the oil companies' activity to date has been speculative, involving a fraction of the capital spent on fossil fuel production each year and limited to buying rights to prospective lithium resources, taking minority stakes in lithium companies through venture arms and licensing extraction technology.
ExxonMobil recently paid more than $100mn in cash to acquire oilfield brines containing lithium in the Smackover area of Arkansas, fending off interest from Schlumberger and Equinor, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Equinor took a stake in developer Lithium de France in 2021, while US shale producer Occidental jointly owns TerraLithium, a lithium technology group, and Chevron's chief executive has also expressed interest in the battery metal.
Supply growth of lithium in recent years has been driven by the rise of Australian and Chinese hard-rock resources, which have added to Latin America's brines that are the other key source.
But brine's future contribution — and the involvement of the oil majors — hinges on the commercial development of direct lithium extraction (DLE), a technology unproven at scale that selectively takes the silvery-white mineral out of salty mixtures using membranes, filters or beads.
At present, lithium found in the brine beneath salt-encrusted land, known as salar, in South America is extracted through evaporation ponds that in effect strip out every other element.
DLE does the opposite and Goldman Sachs says it is a ""potentially gamechanging technology"" — lithium's equivalent of fracking for oil.
It would speed up lithium extraction from months to days, while average recovery rates of 60-80 per cent compared with 40-60 per cent for ponds could make lower concentration resources economically viable.
Success for DLE, which has been used in Argentina by Livent since 1998 and in a handful of projects in Qinghai, China, would open the possibility of oil majors extracting lithium from wastewater at oilfields and at geothermal energy projects that have brine on site.
Oil consultancy Enverus recently described the ""potential multi-billiondollar bonanza"" awaiting DLE investors in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, which is already the world's most prolific oilfield. In one section alone, wastewater used in shale fracking could produce 225,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year, worth $19bn of revenue, Enverus calculated.
DLE projects are also under way in Nevada and Utah. In western Canada's oil-rich Alberta, Imperial Oil, majority owned by Exxon, has joined a DLE venture with E3 Lithium.
Investors in US lithium mining and processing would qualify for subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act passed last year. Canada has also allocated generous tax breaks to the nascent sector.
Despite the natural transfer of oil companies' skills to such resources, the complexity of getting battery-grade materials approved by the carmakers and the small size of the market might not make it worth the effort.
Even on optimistic growth and pricing assumptions, lithium could grow to $150bn a year by 2030 versus the current $2.6tn oil market, according to Financial Times calculations.
With the exception of Rio Tinto, the small market size has even been a hurdle for mining majors making a big bet on the lithium sector. The potential market for the oil majors would be a sliver of the total lithium market.
Ahmed Mehdi, an adviser at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence who consults oil and gas companies on their lithium strategies, said DLE's contribution to lithium supply could grow from 10 per cent now to 15-20 per cent by 2030.
Some industry insiders predict that the early-stage activities could pave the way for a bigger leap into significant production of the metal.
""There are a couple of companies looking to establish a much stronger foothold in the lithium space through M&A, greenfield projects or doubling down on the resources of produced water they do have,"" said Eric Spomer, chief executive of ESM, which plans to supply Ford.
Oil companies' interest goes beyond the brine byproduct of oil production. Equinor said it was ""closely"" following the technology and market developments for lithium extraction from geothermal brines, another renewable energy business in which oil companies want to invest.
Vulcan Energy Resources, backed by Peugeot owner Stellantis, is developing a geothermal lithium project in Germany's Rhine Valley and is in talks with oil and gas companies to partner on the geothermal and DLE parts of the project.
""Whether it's BP, Shell, Eni, Exxon or Equinor — they are all looking at it,"" said Vulcan's deputy chief executive Cris Moreno, referring to the lithium sector.'There area number of oil and gas majors putting a lot of time into how they can become big in lithium' Lithium prices recover after rapid cool-offPrice of lithium carbonate, min 99.5% purity ($'000 per tonne)

| Jump to first hitIs it that they don't know better? Or they simply do not care? It has to be both.
The most arrogant, blundering government in modern times is fixated on devastating the most essential industry Canada has; on stopping the production of the most essential resource of the modern world. The resource that makes the world work: energy.
Everyday Albertans must be asking themselves, without hope of any reply, ""What is it we have done to earn the enmity of this green cabal in Ottawa, so hypnotized by their delusional calling to save the world from global warming that they have now officially given us notice that they want to kill our most productive and central industry? What have we done to be the objects of this economic and political persecution from the stumbling green cabal in Ottawa?"" This latest attempt is not their the first attempt. They gave it a good go in the 1980s, when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau launched the National Energy Program, the single most hated piece of legislation to hit Alberta in all its history.
And now Trudeau the younger is at it again, with an even more obnoxious, more sustained (pun intended) attack on the same industry. Their latest tool to paper over the carnage from their green policies is the newly announced oxymoron - the sustainable jobs act. The title of the act is a lie. It is not about sustaining jobs. It is about killing jobs.
The jobs the Liberals want to kill are not in Ontario. They are not in Quebec. In fact - and I will get back to the particulars - they are not in Newfoundland. They are, of course - and how could it be otherwise? - in the one-time province, now colony of the green Liberal-NDP government, known as Alberta.
The sustainable jobs act, and those backing it - like Labour Minister Seamus O'Regan - are full of misty, vague jabber about creating good jobs and setting up a panel to advise the government. In other words, they don't have a clue yet themselves - but as everyone knows, panels set up by governments are teams of irreproachable geniuses, overloaded with insight and efficiency, and never yet in the history of all politics has a government panel ever failed to meet its objectives.
Irony aside, governments appoint panels in the same way they appoint ""special rapporteurs"" when they wish to duck responsibility, evade scrutiny and hide their own impotence and incompetence.
Interestingly, the attack on Alberta is auditioning for a new name. Up until the sustainable jobs act, it was all about a ""just transition."" We have heard of, and been blasted with, the ""just transition"" tag for at least a couple of years. But now, the man of many ministries, Seamus O'Regan, cabinet minister from an oil-producing province, has told everyone he thinks the phrase is ""toxic."" Wow - how bold.
Well, minister, it was your own guys - Jonathan Wilkinson, Justin Trudeau, Gerald Butts, Catherine McKenna and the always redoubtable, scaler of towers, orange-suited Greenpeace veteran Steven Guilbeault - who have mouthed the phrase tirelessly, and used it to sell their wild green dreams.
By the way, when is the ""just transition"" going to hit Newfoundland? My home of ""pine clad hills"" and ""winter's stern command"" is the other oil-producing province.
Call it an irony if you will, but just a few weeks ago, when Newfoundland was having its annual oil and gas conference, Equinor, the company developing the multi-billion dollar offshore Bay Du Nord project, announced it was being postponed for three years.
The same O'Regan was merciless, calling the announcement ""nothing short of sadistic."" What? How can this be? Surely Newfoundland is under the same axe as Alberta. Surely a delay in developing thousands of more pernicious, non-renewable, non-good jobs is a great thing for the new green future the Liberals are imposing by fiat. Not as good from their point of view as outright cancellation, but a welcome step in the ""just transition"" direction.
But evidently Newfoundland offshore oil gets real backup from the same bunch that's out to ruin Alberta's land-based oil. Bad Equinor, says O'Regan. As I say, call it an irony if you wish, but hypocrisy is also available.
Wake up. When done with Alberta, Newfoundland will be the next target for the full elimination of its oil resources. After all, those oil rigs are Satan's own source of ""carbon emissions"" and are surely tipping the scale to the warming apocalypse as much as Alberta's industry.
I don't suppose the minister from Newfoundland remembers that after the cod collapse, his fellow citizens went to Alberta looking for work and were welcomed in the oilpatch and Fort Mc-Murray, where they earned enough to send money home. Newfoundland, when it was most needed, got immense help and hospitality from Alberta - and from the very industry O'Regan now works to demolish. For the Lord's sake, show some gratitude.
A government that can't issue a passport, is slack to the point of negligence on China's interference in our politics and gives $13-billion subsidies to battery factories now turns its clumsy eyes on a vast and reckless rearrangement of a whole province's economy. What could possibly go wrong? After all, they are promising good clean jobs. As opposed to, I presume, those nongood, non-clean, non-green jobs we already have.
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has found in this issue that rare combination of a duty that is also a pleasure: she has to utterly reject the green Liberal-NDP's desperate assault on her province. Judging from her first response, that's where she's going. I expect Newfoundland Premier Andrew Furey to back her.
One final point: with all this talk from O'Regan about the workers, may we ask if he has polled those workers who now have jobs - those non-good, non-clean, nongreen, high-paying jobs in oil and gas - how they feel about being turfed out of their livelihoods? And it's all so that Trudeau, O'Regan and Guilbeault can wander around Davos and Paris and get a pat on the back from Al Gore and Greta Thunberg and a ""job well-done"" from Klaus Schwab.

Minister of Mines and Energy Alexandre Silveira announces around R$ 45 billion for private initiative for the natural gas sector in Brazil. The value is the result of articulation between the Ministry of Minis and Energy (MME) with Equinor, Repsol and Petrobrás.Key Highlights:* The system will bring in 14 million cubic meters of gas per day.*It is estimated that the capacity of the FPSO is approximately 126,000 barrels per day and that of gas production and export, 16 million m3 /day.*The amount represents about 15% of the Brazilian gas demand at departure.* Of the total concession stake, 35% belongs to Equinor, operator of the Block, another 35% belongs to Repsol Sinopec Brasil and 30% belongs to Petrobras.Original Press Release:May 8 -- Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil issued the following news releases:- Private investment articulated by the MME in the context of the “Programa Gás Para Empregar” will allow 14 million cubic meters of gas per day to reach the Brazilian coast, and will promote reindustrialization, generating employment and income for the Brazilian population.The Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira, announced this Monday (08/05) investments of around R$ 45 billion by the private sector for the natural gas sector in Brazil. The value is the result of an important articulation between the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) with Equinor, Repsol and Petrobrás, in the context of the Gás Para Empregar Program. This is the final investment decision for the development of exploratory block BMC 33, in the Campos Basin, in Rio de Janeiro.According to Alexandre Silveira, the amount will be used to create the most modern exploration platform in the world. “We are talking about an extremely modern platform, in an important well from the gas point of view, which will be able to bring 14 million cubic meters of gas a day to the Brazilian coast. An initiative that will help Brazil to be self-sustainable from an energy point of view, in addition to emitting less carbon in the world and increasing our productive capacity”, highlighted the minister.Investments should also promote benefits to the Brazilian population. After all, one of the articulation's priorities was the generation of employment and income. “It is part of the process that these companies hire part of the equipment and professionals in Brazil, without losing competitiveness, respecting governance, legal and financial security. After all, this is the great purpose of our government, under the command of President Lula: to prioritize job and income generation through national potential”, he added.The initiative is also expected to increase Brazil's role in the energy transition, starting from the start of production, expected to occur in 2028. It is estimated that the FPSO's capacity is approximately 126,000 barrels per day and that of production and export of gas, 16 million m3/day.The amount represents about 15% of the Brazilian demand for gas at departure. The expectation is for a recovery of oil and gas reserves above 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe).

I-- Edinburgh's southside, an area popular with students and families, it is difficult to walk far without seeing the hashtag: #Stop Rosebank.
It's not a mean-spirited protest against new flowerbeds. Instead, stickers slapped on street furniture refer to the planned development by Norwegian oil group Equinor of a large new oilfield 80 miles west of the Shetland Islands.
The sticker protest in the Scottish capital may appear feeble especially as oil and gas policy is largely reserved to Westminster. But the Rosebank project will soon overtake strong financial results from the likes of BP and Shell to become the new national lightning rod for criticism of the UK's fossil fuel poli- cies. It will also bring attention to inconsistencies in efforts to build cleaner energy infrastructure that need urgent attention.
Regulators are shortly expected to decide whether Equinor can proceed with the 300mn barrel oilfield.
Approval will be controversial with climate groups but symbolic for an oil and gas sector that as recently as two years ago found itself out of favour with politicians and investors alike. Equinor is hoping to start awarding contracts to suppliers before the spring is out.
Far larger protests will follow. Rosebank is double the size of Cambo, another North Sea oilfield that was at the centre of a fierce campaign by climate activists in 2021 until one of its backers, Shell, hit pause on the scheme.
For environmental groups, new fossil fuel projects that will produce oil or gas in decades to come are inconsistent with the UK's 2050 net zero emissions target. Activists won't be assuaged no matter how many arguments are put forward about how some oil and gas will still be needed in 27 years and domestic production provides more security than relying on dirtier, imported barrels.
The government will no doubt try to deflect attention away from Rosebank by highlighting how it is simultaneously pursuing ambitious targets to increase clean energy production.
Here ministers have another problem though. Many energy executives, investors and parliamentarians are growing sceptical about how those targets can be achieved. They also lament how oil and gas projects receive more generous tax treatment than clean energy schemes.
Ministers won't be able to head off fresh oil and gas protests without stopping new drilling — something they are unwilling to do given security of supply concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But they can still win back renewables companies and investors who are starting to have doubts over the government's commitments.
The strength of those doubts were highlighted by a recent report by the House of Commons' business, energy and industrial strategy committee.
MPs on the committee pointed out that exemptions built into the UK's two separate windfall taxes on energy companies were ""less generous"" for renewable electricity generators ""than those given to the oil and gas sector"". Those inequalities were among several factors that were ""putting the viability of many renewable projects in danger"".
The UK introduced a windfall tax on oil and gas producers last year, which raised their combined headline tax rate from 40 per cent to 75 per cent. But the tax was also accompanied by a generous investment allowance that offers about 91p of relief for every pound invested in new extraction projects.
The same does not apply to the windfall tax on clean energy companies, although the Treasury argues the 45 per cent electricity generator levy only applies to revenues above a threshold of £75 per megawatt hour. That means the higher rate does not capture all profits.
Companies including the UK's SSE have also complained that price support in an important UK government contract auction for new renewable energy projects has been set too low. They fear projects will be put on hold unless the government takes greater account of factors such as rising wind turbine costs, which have increased by more than 33 per cent since the end of 2021.
Clean energy investors have attractive offers elsewhere as the US and EU aggressively court their investment. UK ministers should urgently reassess areas of concern before patience runs out.

The helicopter carrying the heads of Nato and the European Commission flew in thick cloud off the Norwegian coast, right until it reached the Troll gas platform when the sky brightened almost miraculously.
Troll, Norway's largest gasfield, has certainly proved its worth to Europe in recent months, providing about 10 per cent of the gas needs of the continent, including the UK.
Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg came as much to thank Norway for increasing the flow of gas to get through a difficult winter as to send a message to Russia not to try to sabotage any North Sea infrastructure.
The hosts on the platform ? Norwegian prime minister Jonas Gahr St?re and Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal ? were all smiles as they took their guests 300 metres below sea level to the bottom of one of the platform shafts. But, behind the bonhomie, there are also big differences in emphasis on what the energy future might look like.
Since the start of the Ukraine war, Norway has displaced Russia as Europe's biggest source of gas. Along with its main oil and gas group, statecontrolled Equinor, Norway has argued increasingly that it is the democratic supplier of choice to the continent. For years, it had sought to position itself as being able to deliver barrels of oil with one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world (if that is not an oxymoron). Now it has hit on this new argument to stand out from more autocratic suppliers such as Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
""It's a reality, it speaks for itself,"" said St?re as the North Sea wind buffeted the platform, pointing to figures showing Norway now supplies 30 to 40 per cent of Europe's gas. ""Norway is a Nato ally, a democratic partner, and that brings stability and predictability, both to Europe and the UK.""
Equinor may be investing in wind power and other green technology but it also sees a decent future for gas and oil.
Opedal pointedly said on the platform that Troll would continue producing beyond 2050, which is the target date for the EU to be carbon neutral.
'Norway is a democratic that brings predictability, EUROPE and the
Oil and gas exploration in Norway continues almost unabated, despite a government agreement with a small leftwing party to not open any new areas during this parliamentary term.
In January, Oslo offered a record number of blocks in existing areas in the Arctic for companies to explore.
Europe is grateful in the short term for Norway's increased gas production in the past year. Von der Leyen repeatedly gave thanks to ""our friends"" in Norway while on the platform.
But the EU's overarching current goal is to achieve net zero emissions and so it wants to accelerate its push towards green technologies, putting an emphasis on the likes of wind power and hydrogen rather than gas in the mid to long term.
""Of course, the future is renewables,""
said von der Leyen. That leads to some tensions in the discussions.
People involved in negotiations between Norway and Europe say the EU appears reluctant to commit to large gas volumes for a long period. Norway would ideally also like to get an EU imprimatur for its aggressive petroleum plans in the Arctic, recognising that now might be its time of maximum leverage.
St?re is keen to present a different side of Norway, too. His government speaks warmly about offshore wind, even though Norway hugely lags behind other North Sea countries such as the UK and Denmark on this.
He also talks up the prospects for carbon capture and storage. An early Norwegian attempt at this failed. But several efforts, including one involving Equinor in the North Sea, are now taking place. Finally, Norway is pushing hydrogen. Eventually, it will be so-called green hydrogen made using renewable energy. But, before that, Oslo is heavily backing blue hydrogen where gas is used and the carbon captured and stored.
""All that will be the future; gas is the transition technology,"" said St?re.
Within a few years, he added that it might be possible to spy offshore wind farms within a kilometre or two of Troll, while carbon might be injected into the seabed a similar distance away.
But, standing on a platform that still earns about $80mn a day at current gas prices, there is a sense that Norway has little incentive to turn its back prematurely on the industry that made it rich ? even as interest in green energy rises.
There is little doubt that this sector will stay lucrative in the short run but questions abound over whether Norway is moving fast enough for its longerterm future.

Rosebank, a vast oilfield 80 miles off the Shetland Islands, is set to become a new front in the war between environmental campaigners and the fossil fuels industry ahead of expected government approval in coming weeks.
The £4.5bn project owned by Norwegian state energy company Equinor would see drilling for close to 300mn barrels of oil and gas, making it more than twice the size of the nearby Cambo field, which itself has been hugely controversial. Two UK regulators are expected to give it approval in April before a final decision by energy secretary Grant Shapps.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine the UK government has become more enthusiastic about issuing new North Sea oil licences in order to maintain energy security by boosting domestic supply. ""Unless you can explain how we can transition [to net zero] without oil and gas, we need oil and gas,"" Shapps said last week.
If the project is approved, it will become a lightning rod for the debate between those who want an immediate end to new licences in the North Sea and those who believe domestic oil and gas is needed even as the country shifts towards net zero by 2050. The government angered the oil industry last year by introducing a windfall tax, although the ""energy profits levy"" includes generous investment tax breaks.
Uplift, a campaign group, has estimated that burning the oil and gas from the site would produce more than 200mn tonnes of carbon dioxide — more than the combined annual CO2 emissions from the world's 28 lowestincome countries such as Uganda and Ethiopia.
""These are the same countries that have contributed the least to the climate crisis but are experiencing among the worst impact,"" the group said.
Ed Miliband, Labour's shadow energy secretary, said at an event last week that taxpayers should not be supporting the project given that it would do nothing to lower consumer bills.
""It's equivalent to carbon from running 56 coal-fired power stations for a year in the UK,"" he said. ""Why is that a good use of taxpayer money? The government might be choosing to ignore the science but I'm not going to ignore the science.""
The Rosebank site, which lies 1km below the surface of the North Sea, was first discovered by Chevron in 2004 but the company declared the project une- conomic. It was taken on by Equinor in 2019. It still needs approval from the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning and then the North Sea Transition Authority.
Equinor claims the project will create 1,600 jobs at the height of its construction phase. ""Across the lifetime of the field, Rosebank will continue to support significant employment with an average of 450 UK-based full time direct, indirect and induced jobs,"" it said.
The Norwegian company, which is also building the world's largest wind farm at Dogger Bank, argues that oil and gas will continue to play a role for decades even as the world moves towards low-carbon energy sources.

The rate will go up to 25 per cent from April, up from the current rate of 19 per cent, in line with plans set out by Rishi Sunak when Chancellor in 2021.
However, in welcome news for energy firms, Hunt is expected to bring in a price floor for the windfall tax amid fears Equinor could pull out of the massive Rosebank oil and gas field, City A.M. understands.
The Norwegian energy giant is concerned about the lack of stability in the tax regime compared to its home market, which has higher taxes but an established investment allowance and a calmer political climate.
Downing Street has been under pressure to ease the levy amid fears it could lead to an investment exodus since it was first introduced last May.
Under the new price floor proposals, the windfall tax will be switched off when oil and gas prices return to 'normal levels'. However, what constitutes 'normal levels' for the price floor has not yet been agreed.
The government is also considering plans to expand the scope of the investment relief - set at 91p in the pound - to include carbon capture and storage if tagged onto existing oil and gas fields to reduce emissions.
It is unclear whether Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will go through with the proposals, but an announcement could be made at the budget today.
Equinor refused to comment on the speculation, but told City A.M. it was keen for a stable investment climate.

| Jump to first hitThe government’s decision to tax oil exports has prompted five private-sector oil companies to challenge the measure in court in an attempt to overturn the levy. Shell, Equinor, Petrogal, Repsol Sinopec and TotalEnergies filed for an injunction against the tax in a federal court on Wednesday. In a note, Shell said it ""sees with concern"" the creation of the tax, and that it anticipates a financial impact on the company in Brazil. A similar move is being considered by other oil companies, including smaller ones.One of the first to move was Prio (formerly PetroRio), which filed for two injunctions in the Federal Court of Rio, which were rejected on Tuesday, sources say. There are two lawsuits, one on behalf of Prio and another on behalf of Dommo, formerly OGX, which was bought by Prio. The company declined to comment. Lawyers say the companies can now bring the request to an appellate court.The export tax was announced last week by Finance Minister Fernando Haddad. The government introduced the 9.2% tax on crude oil exports from March to June through Provisional Measure 1.163/2023, to compensate for the drop in tax collection due to the fuel tax relief.Shell criticized the tax in a note. ""The measure, which was announced without any meaningful dialogue with the industry, throws uncertainty on new investment decisions, affecting the competitiveness of Brazil in the exploration and production sector - in which Brazil has a strong geological potential,"" he said.According to Equinor, the decision to challenge the tax in court is intended to address the industry’s concerns about the attractiveness of investments for the country. According to the Norwegian company, these investments ""require predictability in the legal and regulatory structures, with absolute respect for contracts.""The names of the five foreign companies that filed a lawsuit against the tax appear in a case filed with the 16th Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro. TotalEnergies declined to comment. Repsol Sinopec and Petrogal did not immediately reply to a request for comment.Petrobras and ExxonMobil, which are large exporters but are not parties to the lawsuit, also declined to comment. The Brazilian Petroleum Institute (IBP) confirmed to Valor that it is considering legal action against the tax collection.Shell pointed out that Congress may suspend the tax or extend it beyond the four months initially planned. ""Therefore, it is too early to speculate on the potential impact,"" the company said.In addition to the business community, politicians have also moved to stop the tax. The Liberal Party (PL), the party of former President Jair Bolsonaro, filed a direct action of unconstitutionality (Adin) in the Federal Supreme Court (STF) to suspend the tax. ""We believe that this tax is a clear setback from the point of view of economic policy, with serious consequences on the issue of legal security, in addition to circumventing the Brazilian Constitution,"" said Senate opposition leader Rogério Marinho. ""Minister [of Finance, Fernando] Haddad himself makes clear that it aims to increase tax collection to reduce the budget deficit,"" the senator added, recalling that tax increases must respect a 90-day period before coming into effect.The provisional measure 1,163, however, claims that the collection will be made in the form of a steering tax.For the leader of the PL, Senator Carlos Portinho, ""there is damage to the states where oil is extracted. These oil-producing states will be directly affected by this measure."" Opposition lawmakers say that the courts are the only path available, since they estimate that the government does not even intend for the provisional measure to be voted on by Congress - since these matters have immediate effect, it would run for the four months during which the temporary taxation would be implemented and then expire.Industry observers believe, however, that the tax could be extended beyond the initial four months and remain a permanent tax. According to Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV), the tax increases producers’ costs, affects existing contracts, and discourages investment in new exploration and production frontiers in the country.In a note, the institution recalled that the global scenario is one of limited oil supply and that Brazil is in a beneficial position to export, being in a period of increased production and relative stability of domestic demand. ""Taxing exports in a sector that contribute more than R$170 billion in annual revenues to the state only contributes to the loss of competitiveness of Brazilian oil,"" he said.Jennifer Cotta, head of the Customs Law Commission of the Brazilian Bar Association in Rio de Janeiro, said that the companies have strong arguments to suspend the collection in court, such as the fact that an export tax cannot have a collection purpose and that the collection generates a change in the conditions of the concession contracts for areas for exploration and production of oil and gas. ""This tax harms basic principles of law, such as legal security and the principle of least surprise,"" the lawyer, a partner at Kincaid Mendes Vianna Advogados, said.Mr. Cotta says this tax affects the country’s credibility, which can have an impact on the attraction of investment for years, because of the perception that ""the rules can change in the middle of the game."" ""It is a loss for producers in Brazil, who will compete with companies abroad that do not pay this tax,"" he said.Dommo claims in a lawsuit filed with the 27th Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro that this is a steering tax that violates the principles of the Constitution, which guarantees free competition and forbids the linking of tax revenues to any entity, fund, or expenditure. Judge Geraldine Vital rejected the request, arguing that the federal government has the power to modify customs tax rates, as stated in the decision seen by Valor.In the other case, before the 12th Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro, Prio also argues that the fee is unconstitutional since its purpose is only to collect revenue, without any objective proposal to promote the sector. Judge Marcus Livio Gomes also denied the request, saying it had not been proven that the tax would make the company’s activities unfeasible. ""It has not been fully demonstrated that the introduction of the tax rate under study would violate the principles of non-binding, free competition, equal treatment, and ability to pay,"" said the judge.In a report, Fitch estimates that the impact of the charge on Prio could lead to a 12% drop in EBITDA. The company today exports most of its production, about 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. ""If made permanent, the new tax could encourage the oil company and other independent oil exporters to sell locally, since these sales are subject to a similar tax rate, and the low-cost production profiles offer flexibility,"" he said.When announcing the creation of the tax, Finance Minister Fernando Haddad cited the possibility that the measure would stimulate domestic refining. Representatives of the independent refineries, however, have already signaled that it is unlikely that a short-term tax will have an impact on investments in this segment. For Fitch, the charge raises concerns about the policies of the Lula administration for the energy sector. ""The announcement signals the beginning of increased government interference in the sector,"" it said.Fitch also signals that the impact of the tax may be relevant for Petrobras. ""Fiscal pressures and policies that weaken the company’s financial flexibility will likely put its future investments at risk.""(Vandson Lima and Caetano Tonet contributed to this story.)"

Public sector oil giant ONGC is becoming more collaborative in its exploration and production activities. To harness the benefits of international expertise, risk sharing, and technology and skill enhancement, ONGC has entered into agreements with names like ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalEnergies, Equinor and Shell.
In an interview with BusinessLine , Sushma Rawat, the first woman Director (Exploration) of ONGC, said, “Our focus for 2023 is clear... to provide a fillip to exploration and achieve the government’s mandate of reducing import dependency. Three years’ action [plan], from 2022-23 to 2024-25, has been adopted.
“The Exploration Portfolio Management Board (EPMB), at its recent meeting, for 2023, has recommended 70 locations for release targeting close to 150 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mmtoe) of yet-to-find (YTF) resources with a proposed investment of Rs. 2,700 crore. Also, some of the released locations will be targeted for reserve upgradation as per ONGC’s commitment towards increasing production and to bring the Bengal Basin to Category-I status.”
Category-I basins are those which have reserves and are already producing; category-II basins have contingent resources pending commercial production; and category-III basins have prospective resources awaiting discovery.
Pacts with global cos
On the status of ONGC’s agreements with international giants, she said the agreement with ExxonMobil was inked on August 17, 2022, for collaboration in deepwater exploration in the KG-Cauvery and Kutch offshore basins. The technical discussions have taken place between the exploration teams and a joint examination is underway for the Kutch basin.
The Chevron MoU is for potential collaboration in the Tripura fold belt, Bengal offshore as well as KG-Cauvery; a confidentiality agreement has been signed with TotalEnergies, France, for Andaman & Mahanadi offshore. An MoU has been signed with Equinor, Norway, for various works including upstream, mid-stream, marketing, renewables (offshore wind), and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). An MoU with Shell is towards CCUS studies, focusing on carbon dioxide storage and enhanced oil recovery screening forkey basinsin India, includingdepleted oil and gas fieldsandsaline aquifers.
On the action plan to achieve the target, she said, “ONGC has in place a rapid acreage expansion plan, which is an accelerated survey plan: Two-fold increase in quantum of 3D seismic data acquisition; to probe significant YTF resources by 2025; enhancing data coverage through 2D and 3D seismic surveys in deepwater and other promising areas, and drilling close to 350 wells to probe YTF potential; increasing CAPEX by 150 per cent for exploration; and diversifying the data coverage through government-funded project in three sectors, namely, West Coast, East Coast and Andaman offshore.”
Significant YTF is locked in the frontiers of our sedimentary basins and deepwaters, she added.
“Going forward, for next few years our strategy would be based on maintenance of current level of production... quick monetisation of unmonetised discoveries. Further, we need to achieve production growth by tapping into high pressure-high temperature, deepwater and ultra-deepwater resources,” she said.
“Future thrust will concentrate around improving exploration efficiency processes and workflows, re-exploration in mature basin where, I believe, there can be a basin within basin, fast-tracking of drilling in new prospective areas of category-II basins and consolidation of new finds with faster monetisation, maximising recovery, increasing production through upgradation of lower category reserves and conversion of YTF resources to producible volumes, and conversion of 15 per cent of undiscovered into discovered in-place (around 4 billion tonnes).
Second discovery
On the successes achieved, she said recent exploration successes in Bengal and Vindhyan basins have been encouraging.  “We have made second discovery at Bengal Basin. In Vindhyan basin too, ONGC [has had] commercial success in the Hatta. We are again venturing into high-risk, high-gain deep-/ultra-deepwater exploration in east and west coast of India. For that, ONGC has already acquired a few deep-/ultra-deepwater exploration acreages under the Open Acreage Licensing Policy in Cauvery basin, Andaman basin and Mahanadi basin.
“More new deep-/ultra-deepwater areas (prospective) have been identified in Kerala-Konkan basin, Saurashtra and Mumbai offshore. Our deepwater exploration is likely to see large capex allocation. So, in a nutshell, ONGC’s deep-/ultra-deepwater exploration is very much in the forefront and will intensify in the years to come,” she said.

Norwegian energy group Equinor made a record adjusted pre-tax profit of $75bn last year thanks to all-time high natural gas prices, helping it to emerge as one of the biggest winners of the energy crisis as the country replaced Russia as Europe's largest supplier.
The state-run group paid $42.8bn in tax related to its operations on the Norwegian continental shelf, where it is the largest producer, providing a windfall for Oslo equivalent to more than $7,900 for every person in the country.
Norway has won praise in Europe for helping avert gas shortages by maximising output in the past 18 months as Russia slashed exports. It is the biggest supplier to the UK and Germany.
But Equinor's huge profits and the taxes flowing to the Norwegian state have also drawn scrutiny at a time when consumers face record energy bills.
Anders Opedal, Equinor's chief executive, said the company had ""responded to the energy crisis and contributed to energy security"", adding it would raise returns to shareholders to an expected $17bn this year, citing its strong earnings, outlook and balance sheet.
Opedal said the company would increase its cash dividend to $0.30 a share for the last three months of the year, from $0.20 a share in the third quarter, and introduce an ""extraordinary cash dividend"" of $0.60. It plans to buy back $6bn of shares in 2023. Its shares were up 6.8 per cent yesterday.
Energy majors such as BP, Shell and
ExxonMobil have all reported record earnings for the year and are expected to end 2022 with combined post-tax earnings of more than $200bn.
Equinor has a much higher effective tax rate than rivals of more than 70 per cent because of its dominance of production in Norway, where oil and gas earnings have a combined marginal tax rate of 78 per cent.
That compares with an effective global tax rate for BP and Shell of about 34 per cent.
Norway's tax administrator last month estimated its total tax take from oil and gas production in 2022 will reach $89.5bn, or more than $16,500 per head of population. The EU's total public spending per capita in 2021-22 averaged just over €14,000 ($15,000), according to the EU Parliament. The UK's total public spending per capita in 2021-22 was £11,897 ($14,300), according to HM Treasury.
This year may be more challenging for Equinor because natural gas prices have fallen sharply in recent months, though they remain high by historical standards. TTF, the European gas benchmark, has fallen from a peak of more than €300 per megawatt hour in August to about €54 today.
Biraj Borkhataria, at RBC Capital Markets, said Equinor was keen to flag to investors it was prioritising returns: the proposed $17bn of payouts this year is equivalent to just under a fifth of the company's total market capitalisation.
The $75bn annual pre-tax earnings smashed the group's previous record of $36.2bn in 2008 when oil prices reached record highs of more than $140 a barrel.
Adjusted earnings for the year after tax were $22.7bn, up from $10bn in 2021. Equinor reported pre-tax adjusted earnings of $15.1bn in the final three months of the year, beating analyst estimates of $14.4bn.Norway has won praise in Europe for helping avert shortages by maximising gas output for 18 months

LONDON -- BP PLC Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to dial back elements of the oil giant's high-profile push into renewable energy, according to people familiar with recent discussions.
Mr. Looney has said he is disappointed in the returns from some of the oil giant's renewable investments and plans to pursue a narrower green-energy strategy, the people said. He has told some people close to the company that BP needs to do more to convince shareholders of its strategy to maximize profits in areas where it has a competitive advantage, including its legacy oil-and-gas operations.
In some of the conversations, Mr. Looney has said he plans to place less emphasis on so-called ESG goals -- a catchall term for environmental, social and governance -- to help clarify that those aren't distracting the company from its ability to deliver profits, the people said.
Mr. Looney, the people said, is casting the moves as a modest short-term course correction rather than a major strategic pivot for the 114-year-old company.
Analysts and some investors say pledges by BP to shift away from fossil fuels and into renewable energy risk handicapping the company's performance. Many companies are struggling to transition to new green technologies while still relying heavily on traditional energy sources.
A BP spokesman referred to previous statements Mr. Looney and BP have made about the company's strategy, including its commitment to reducing carbon emissions and shifting investments to green energy. Mr. Looney declined to comment through the spokesman.
BP is scheduled to report full-year earnings Tuesday after consecutive bumper quarters boosted by massive profit in its natural-gas trading arm. The company will update investors on its strategic progress at that time, the spokesman said.
Mr. Looney, a 32-year BP veteran, took over as CEO in early 2020 and soon announced commitments to shrink greenhouse-gas emissions, including from oil and gas the company sells. Analysts said at the time that the new targets went further than rivals' plans. Investors questioned how renewables could make up for fossil-fuel businesses that typically produced higher -- if volatile -- returns.
Shares of BP and rival Shell PLC, which are both based in London, have over the past several years lagged behind those of U.S. competitors, especially the biggest, Exxon Mobil Corp. BP shares are up about 7% from the end of January 2020, having recovered from pandemic lows, while Exxon shares have nearly doubled over the same period.
As European oil companies, BP and Shell face greater investor and government scrutiny over their carbon-reduction plans than do U.S. rivals, which have stuck more to their core oil-and-gas businesses. Still, overall, the sector globally has been caught between some large investorsand governmentscalling for these companies to move away from fossil fuels, while others demand the profits those assets can generate.
BP shares closed up 0.7% on Wednesday in London.
Mr. Looney has said in some of the recent discussions that the company will continue its push into renewable energy, but with a finer-tuned focus to avoid spreading resources too thinly or relying too heavily on renewables in its broader strategy. He has suggested that areas of continued emphasis will include developing climate-friendly hydrogen, biogas and electric-vehicle partnerships and charging networks, the people said.
He and other BP executives have suggested that the company could play down future investment in areas including solar energy and offshore wind, according to some of the people.
Discussions about the company's direction have caused rifts inside BP over the past year, people close to the company say.
Mr. Looney's comments follow a challenging three years as CEO for the 52-year-old Irishman. He took over the role as the pandemic was beginning to destroy global energy demand and kneecap U.S. and European major oil companies. BP in 2020 suffered brutal losses and, like peers, slashed its dividend.
Since then, major oil companies have come roaring back with record profits, making them a target of ire from governments and consumers struggling with high energy prices amid Russia's war in Ukraine. BP and other majors in the past year have showered investors with tens of billions of dollars in share buybacks and dividends, in response to shareholder demands for cash after years of lackluster returns.
BP has said it plans by 2030 to slash its fossil-fuel production by 40% from 2019 levels. Mr. Looney has set a target of increasing investments in what the company calls ""transition growth businesses"" including renewable energy and convenience-store operations to around 50% of total capital spending by 2030, up from more than 40% by 2025. Mr. Looney and his lieutenants have said the company is balancing its deeper push into low-emission projects while still nurturing legacy cash cows like oil-and-gas production and trading.
In February 2022, executives sought to reassure investors by saying BP intends to sustain earnings from oil and gas at $30 billion to $35 billion annually, excluding taxes and other factors, through this decade despite the planned production cuts. They said BP would do that by cutting costs and focusing on high-margin production such as offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
That outlook compares with BP's target to make more than $10 billion a year by 2030 from renewable energy, biogas and other businesses outside of oil-and-gas production.
Finance chief Murray Auchincloss a year ago told The Wall Street Journal in an interview that the fossil-fuel production cuts wouldn't have a big impact on cash flow, ""but there are still some parts of the sector that didn't understand that.""
BP has argued that renewable-energy returns will prove more stable than oil-and-gas profit over the long haul, helping its strategy pay off.
But the path has been rocky. In 2020, BP spent $1.1 billion to acquire 50% stakes in two Northeastern U.S. offshore-wind developments from Norwegian rival Equinor ASA, an early player in offshore wind. The move marked BP's entry into the offshore-wind market. Other wind-project developers and investors still consider the price BP paid as inflated.
BP said the stakes and its new strategic partnership with Equinor would open up opportunities elsewhere in the U.S. offshore-wind market. But project managers with other companies have seen BP shying away from expanding its U.S. offshore-wind ambitions as initially described, according to people familiar with the matter. BP balked at the last minute last year at joining Equinor in competing for wind-energy rights off California, some of the people say.
In October 2022, BP agreed to buy U.S. biogas producer Archaea Energy Inc. in a $4.1 billion deal including $3.3 billion in cash. It was BP's biggest acquisition since 2018.

Mr. Looney went on to say that oil and gas remain core to BP and will help fund its ""transition growth engines"" like electric-vehicle charging and bioenergy. ""Transition does not equal lower returns,"" he said on the podcast.

| Jump to first hitNew Delhi, Jan. 22 -- rituraj.baruah@livemint.comState-run energy major ONGC plans to tie up with French giant TotalEnergies for exploration and production of oil and gas in the Andaman islands, said Sushma Rawat, director, exploration at ONGC Ltd. In an interview, Rawat said that prospective hydrocarbon blocks are expected to be auctioned at the next round of auctions under the Open Acreage Licensing Programme for which both companies may bid as a joint venture.""For deepwater, talks are underway with Total. Andamans, which is coming up, is mostly deepwater. The government has an Island Exploration Project, a lot of seismic data is being acquired in the Andamans which will be processed and analysed. Within a month we will know whether Total would be coming there with us and in what way. With Total we still have to sign an MoU. The talks are in the final stages,"" she added.While the initial survey is being done by the Centre, she said the blocks would be up for auction either through the open acreage licensing policy (OALP-XI) round of auction or there may be a separate round for deepwater exploration and production. ""We have prepared the blocks, we need to submit them,"" she said.The Centre has been ambitious with the National Island Exploration Project, seeking to reduce its import dependence for crude oil in a volatile global market scenario.Talking of the tie-ups and joint ventures, Rawat said apart from Total, the Maharatna company is also looking for tie-ups with other major players in exploration and production, as well as carbon capture, among others.""For international partnerships we had a global outreach programme, which was initiated 2-3 years ago by the then chairman-managing director of ONGC. In that area we have gone ahead, and held a lot of technical discussions and four MoUs have been signed right from ExxonMobil to Equinor to Chevron and all. So, we are looking forward to tie ups with Total and others right from exploration and enhanced oil recovery to carbon capture and renewables."" In August 2022 ONGC signed an agreement with American oil and gas major ExxonMobil for deepwater exploration at India's east and west coasts. The tie-up is expected to firm up by March-end, she said. ""ExxonMobil (contract) is totally (for) deepwater. They have been looking at the data both at the east cost and west coast. They will let us know at the end of March, when their entire study is complete, and identify areas they would like to go for acreage bidding, or may be it will be a joint venture with ONGC,"" she said.She further said: ""We are looking at joint venture between ONGC and ExxonMobil. Right now the technical teams are sitting together and analyzing the data we processed. With ExxonMobil its little bit ahead in terms of but they have given their timeline as March end for them to decide, whether they will come in for a partnership for bidding and exploration.""Rawat added that ONGC is likely to announce a partnership with French company IFP in a month's time for technical domain, software model building and interpretation in order to reduce uncertainty and assure risk management.Speaking on company pilot project for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) for which ONGC has tied up with Norwegian state-owned energy company Equinor, the director (exploration) said that both the companies will discuss the timeline for the project, required investment and if other players need to be involved in the project.She also said that talks are underway with Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) for the procurement of carbon dioxide from the company and the required investment amount would depend upon the cost for carbon dioxide procurement.""We want to take in carbon dioxide and pump it underground, store it in the field which has been producing for a very long time now. So, that is Gandhar in the Cambay basin. For that we have a tie up with the Equinor. They have their project Northern Lights in the North Sea. We would be requiring carbon dioxide from Indian Oil Corporation.

Picking stocks in 2022 was no easy feat. The magic that had caused giant tech names to lead the market higher year after year suddenly ran out. It turned out that much of the magic had been supplied by the Federal Reserve, which suddenly decided to put away its wand. As interest rates climbed, the S&P 500 index fell 19.4%, its worst year since 2008.
Several stocks highlighted in Barron's fell victim to the same dynamics that sunk the broader market—inflation, high interest rates, and supply-chain slowdowns. But overall, our bullish picks fared better than their benchmarks in 2022.
From the date of publication through the end of the year, Barron's names fell 4.8%, while the indexes they are tracked against fell 5.2%. Our two bearish calls hit the mark, too, falling far more than their benchmark.
Barron's follows the performance of our stock picks throughout the year, to allow readers to see how well our predictions work out versus the S&P 500, or the S&P MidCap 400, or the Russell 2000, depending on company size.
The performance tables under Picks & Pans on our stock picks page are updated regularly, and we publish full results in the magazine at least once a year. Not all stocks we write about are tracked. Stocks written about in columns like the Trader and Streetwise aren't included, though columnists often write about their winners and losers at the end of the year. Stories that are about entire industries or that include more than three stocks don't make the cut, either.
Sometimes, writers reconsider their picks because of a new development like an acquisition that changes the investment case. When a writer advises readers to take profits or cut their losses, the pick's gain or loss is locked in at the price of the stock on the date of the follow-up.
Each year, some of the stocks picked in Barron's outperform based on some idiosyncratic characteristic, like a spinoff or a corporate reshuffling. On an aggregate basis, however, success or failure often depends on whether writers gravitate to the right sectors or industries. In 2022, the energy sector far outperformed the rest of the market. Certain industries, such as pharmaceuticals and farm equipment, also beat the market.
In 2022, our best pick was Texas Pacific Land (ticker: TPL), which owns 880,000 acres in the Permian Basin, the nation's most productive oil basin. The company collects hydraulic fracturing royalties that rise with oil and gas prices and production volumes. Oil prices rose to the highest level since 2008, and the Permian experienced fast growth, with companies like Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) boosting production there.
Other energy names mentioned in Barron's outperformed, too, with APA (APA) and Equinor (EQNR) outpacing their benchmarks by more than 20 percentage points. Both benefited from high oil and gas prices, with Equinor ramping up its transition to cleaner energy, as well.
Barron's also advised readers how to invest in companies helping to alleviate a food shortage last year, which was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Among the biggest winners there was CNH Industrial (CNHI), which uses technology to make farmers more efficient. Its stock returned 32% from the story's July publication to the end of the year.
Starbucks (SBUX) was also a winning pick, returning 33% after our June publication. The stock got a jolt when founder Howard Schultz returned to the helm; it's likely to get another one as China reopens and the coffee drinkers there venture out again. The company has been able to raise prices, so expect your Venti to get a little more caro.
Not every pick did well. Among the biggest losers was home internet provider Starry Group Holdings (STRY), which had to raise capital during a year when the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes made doing so much more expensive. Angi (ANGI), which offers home-service recommendations, grew sales more slowly than expected. And chip maker Synaptics (SYNA) fell victim to a broader slowdown in computer sales.
Barron's published two bearish picks in 2022, both about auto makers. The stories correctly warned readers away from companies that have fallen short in their efforts to build electric vehicles.
Lucid Group (LCID) has struggled to produce its $150,000 electric car in volume and without defects. It is burning through cash and faces increasing competition from deeper-pocketed Tesla, Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Porsche, causing the stock to tumble. And Toyota Motor (TM) pivoted to electric vehicles later than some peers, forcing it into catch-up mode. Its stock has some catching up to do, too.

[The trusted advisers of top business leaders]
Al Cook spent 27 years working for oil-and-gas companies. His newest job brings him closer to an entirely different resource: diamonds.
Next month the 47-year-old takes over as chief executive of De Beers Group, a diamond-mining behemoth that is part of Anglo American PLC.
One person who counseled him on the shift was former Anglo American CEO Mark Cutifani, whom he met when Mr. Cutifani was still in charge of the British mining conglomerate. Mr. Cutifani, who says he wasn't involved in interviewing Mr. Cook for the De Beers job, had some advice: Focus on the technical and sustainability aspects of mining a finite resource. The less-familiar parts, such as the retail supply chain, he could pick up later.
Mr. Cook grew up in the U.K. and Switzerland, studied the natural sciences including geology, and wanted to travel the world. The energy industry was a natural fit.
His first job out of the University of Cambridge was with British oil-and-gas giant BP PLC, then called British Petroleum Co., where he worked as an exploration analyst and rose to chief of staff to the CEO. He later became executive vice president for international exploration and production for Norway's biggest energy company, Equinor ASA, where he stayed for seven years. Mr. Cook has lived in the U.K., U.S., Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Norway and Russia.
Mr. Cook says during the pandemic he became intrigued by the top job at De Beers, having always been fascinated by gemstones and minerals. He asked Mr. Cutifani: Could someone from the energy industry make the transition to a company like De Beers?
Mr. Cutifani's answer: Possibly.
Here is a closer look at how Mr. Cutifani and three others became Mr. Cook's most trusted advisers.
Mark Cutifani
Former CEO, Anglo American; director, TotalEnergies SE
During the pandemic, he got to know Mr. Cutifani while they served together on the board of a charity called The Power of Nutrition, which focused on childhood malnutrition in Asia and Africa. The pandemic challenged both executives to work inside and outside their companies to address the needs of workers and communities in developing nations where they operate, says Mr. Cutifani, who recalls telling Mr. Cook in early 2020 that ""in three months' time, people will remember what we did in the first weeks of the pandemic.""
Amber Rudd
Former U.K. Home Secretary, former U.K. Secretary of State for Energy
Mr. Cook says Ms. Rudd has been helpful to him since she left U.K. politics in 2019 and joined Equinor's international advisory group as chair in 2020. ""At a time when politics is changing so fast, she has helped me to see the motivations behind politics, and how companies and governments can work together,"" Mr. Cook says. ""There are too few people who try to work between the two."" Both say a global transition away from fossil fuels to renewable-energy sources in order to lower climate-harming carbon emissions demands a long-term joint effort.
Jason Bordoff
Founding director, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University
Mr. Cook met Professor Bordoff soon after joining Equinor, which is a supporter of the program Prof. Bordoff oversees at Columbia University. In 2021, Mr. Cook became a member of the program's advisory board. Prof. Bordoff says the challenges that oil-and-gas companies face from investors and governments stir up constant tensions. ""The pace of that transition is very uncertain. That was a core part of Al's job,"" he says. He says there are similarities between energy and mining. ""It's an industry that requires navigating a lot of thorny political and geopolitical risks.""
Anne Drinkwater
Non-executive director, Equinor
Mr. Cook first met Ms. Drinkwater when he was 22 years old and flew to Houston to interview for a job as an oil-and-gas exploration analyst at British Petroleum. She became a mentor and they stayed in touch all through his time at BP, and then at Equinor, where Ms. Drinkwater serves on the board. When he accepted the De Beers job, he says she reminded him to think about the roughly 2,000 Equinor employees depending on him during his final weeks there. When he starts at De Beers, her advice is to ""think about the people first,"" she says she told him.

Al Cook spent 27 years working for oil-and-gas companies. His newest job brings him closer to an entirely different resource: diamonds.
Next month the 47-year-old takes over as chief executive of De Beers Group, a diamond-mining behemoth that is part of Anglo American PLC. One person who counseled him on the shift was former Anglo American CEO Mark Cutifani, whom he met when Mr. Cutifani was still in charge of the British mining conglomerate.
Bio Bits
* Age: 47
* Education: Bachelor's degree and master's degree in natural sciences, the University of Cambridge
* Family: Wife Susie and three children
* What's the worst advice you've ever received? ""There's no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes,"" just before snowmobiling in the Norwegian Arctic at minus-13 degrees Fahrenheit.
* Favorite recent read: ""A Man Called Ove"" by Fredrik Backman—read with his elder daughter. ""It taught me more about Scandinavia than all the culture training courses that I've attended.""
Mr. Cutifani, who says he wasn't involved in interviewing Mr. Cook for the De Beers job, had some advice: Focus on the technical and sustainability aspects of mining a finite resource. The less-familiar parts, like the retail supply chain, he could pick up later.
""There's a lot that we can learn from the oil and gas sector,"" Mr. Cutifani says, drawing parallels between two industries with persistent reputational challenges. ""In mining we touch everything.""
Mr. Cook grew up in the U.K. and Switzerland, studied the natural sciences including geology, and wanted to travel the world. The energy industry was a natural fit.
His first job out of the University of Cambridge was with British oil-and-gas giant BP PLC, then called British Petroleum Co., where he worked as an exploration analyst and rose to chief of staff to the CEO. That was during a tumultuous time for BP, following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.
He later became executive vice president for international exploration and production for Norway's biggest energy company, Equinor ASA, where he stayed for seven years. Mr. Cook has lived in the U.K., U.S., Vietnam, Azerbaijan, Norway and Russia.
Azerbaijan—straddling Eastern Europe and Western Asia—was the most formative, he says. That period involved a massive natural-gas development and pipeline requiring the cooperation of seven countries. ""Azerbaijan wanted to strengthen its links to Europe. So I went out there for a year and spent five years,"" Mr. Cook says.
Mr. Cook says he felt ready for a change during the pandemic and became intrigued by the top job at De Beers, having always been fascinated by gemstones and minerals. He asked Mr. Cutifani: Could someone from the energy industry make the transition to a company like De Beers?
Mr. Cutifani's answer: Possibly.
Here is a closer look at how Mr. Cutifani and three others became Mr. Cook's most trusted advisers:
Mark Cutifani
Former CEO, Anglo American; director, TotalEnergies SE
During the pandemic, he got to know Mr. Cutifani while they served together on the board of a charity called The Power of Nutrition, focused on fighting childhood malnutrition in Asia and Africa.
The two talked about how their companies could support communities where they operated, working with other business and government leaders. ""I started going to Mark for advice on that, because his understanding of what was happening in Africa was so profound.""
The pandemic challenged both executives to work inside and outside their companies to address the needs of workers and communities in developing nations where they operate, says Mr. Cutifani, who recalls telling Mr. Cook in early 2020 that ""in three months' time, people will remember what we did in the first weeks of the pandemic."" Basic needs like clean water and food were endangered in some countries. ""He was very quick and naturally scratching at what are the things we can do with people, with the governments.""
What the mining industry doesn't do, Mr. Cutifani says, ""is tell our story."" Mr. Cook, he said, should be able to help with that at De Beers. ""He's bright, I think he understands the importance of sustainability and the social dimension.""
Amber Rudd
Former U.K. Home Secretary, former U.K. Secretary of State for Energy; energy-sector adviser
Mr. Cook says Ms. Rudd has been helpful to him since she left U.K. politics in 2019 and joined Equinor's international advisory group as chair in 2020.
""At a time when politics is changing so fast, she has helped me to see the motivations behind politics, and how companies and governments can work together,"" Mr. Cook says. The relationship between the private and public sectors is often fraught with misunderstandings and mistrust, he adds. ""There are too few people who try to work between the two.""
Both say the energy transition—a global move away from fossil fuels to renewable-energy sources in order to lower climate-harming carbon emissions—demands a long-term joint effort.
""The trend that will continue over the next decade is a growing intolerance of companies that don't have climate change at their heart,"" Mr. Cook says. ""The advice she gives me—stick with the strategy, the strategy will last a decade, the noise will be gone tomorrow—is the way she has led her political career.""
Ms. Rudd says he's always up front about the world's need for more offshore wind and other renewable energy. ""He is steeped in oil and gas. He's also very committed to the energy transition.""
Jason Bordoff
Columbia University professor, founding director of Center on Global Energy Policy
Mr. Cook met Prof. Bordoff soon after joining Equinor, which is majority-owned by the Norwegian government and among corporate supporters of the program focused on energy policy that Mr. Bordoff oversees at Columbia University. In 2021, Mr. Cook became a member of the program's advisory board.
Prof. Bordoff's research has provided a balance between the objectives of the energy transition and the reality of current global energy needs, Mr. Cook says. ""You could shout as much as you'd like about climate change. A lot of people do,"" he says. ""But if you're really going to solve climate change, you've got to solve the fact that more people want more energy than ever before.""
Prof. Bordoff says the challenges that oil-and-gas companies face from investors and governments stir up constant tensions. ""The pace of that transition is very uncertain. That was a core part of Al's job,"" he says.
He has talked with Mr. Cook about his new job, and sees many similarities between energy and mining. ""It's an industry that requires navigating a lot of thorny political and geopolitical risks,"" he says. ""He's thoughtful and introspective about the broad challenges, tensions and the risks."".
Anne Drinkwater
Nonexecutive director, Equinor
Mr. Cook first met Ms. Drinkwater when he was 22 years old and flew to Houston to interview for a job as an oil-and-gas exploration analyst at British Petroleum.
Ms. Drinkwater, a British-born executive who at the time was Houston-based commercial manager for BP, welcomed him into her office. ""His educational background didn't completely match what he wanted to do,"" she says. His geology training needed bolstering from operational know-how and business-side experience.
He got the job anyway, in part from recognizing all there was to learn. ""He was very clear in what he wanted to do,"" Ms. Drinkwater says. ""It didn't feel like he was having to prove anything.""
From that meeting, he recalls one question in particular that was both humorous but also came with wisdom that served him well when he relocated. ""She said: 'Have you ever been to America before?' I said 'No, this is the first time.' She said, 'Don't assume that all of America is like Texas.'""
She became a mentor and they stayed in touch all through his time at BP, and then at Equinor, where Ms. Drinkwater serves on the board.
When he accepted the De Beers job, he says she reminded him to think about the roughly 2,000 Equinor employees depending on him during his final weeks there. ""'What do they need from you in the last few months that you'll be in this company? Not what do you need,'"" he says she told him.
Ms. Drinkwater says she told him not to let the corporate onboarding process dictate everything about how he enters the De Beers CEO job. ""Think about the people first,"" she says she told him.

Norway's Equinor and Germany's RWE are to build several new gas power plants that will eventually be run on hydrogen as part of plans by the two countries for an extensive partnership in greener energy.
State-controlled oil and gas group Equinor and utility RWE signed an agreement yesterday to build the plants in Germany.
The facilities will run first on gas, then on hydrogen produced from gas with carbon capture and storage, and finally on hydrogen made using renewable energy.
The Norwegian and German governments at the same time said they would deepen their co-operation in areas including hydrogen, carbon capture and storage, battery technology and offshore wind.
""The energy crisis has highlighted Norway's importance as a reliable supplier of gas to Europe but it has also underscored the need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy,"" said Jonas Gahr Støre, Norway's prime minister.
The agreement involves the building of gas power plants in Germany as part of the country's move away from coal; establishing production for low-carbon hydrogen in Norway; exporting hydrogen via a potential pipeline between the countries; and the joint development of offshore wind farms.
Anders Opedal, Equinor's chief executive, said: ""The collaboration has the potential to develop Norway into a key supplier of hydrogen to Germany and Europe. This is a unique opportunity to build a hydrogen industry in Norway where hydrogen also can be used as feedstock to domestic industries.""
Norway has displaced Russia as the EU's biggest gas supplier since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine last year. It is increasingly pushing itself as the democratic petroleum supplier of choice as opposed to other sources such as Russia or Qatar.
Investing in hydrogen is a large part of Berlin's efforts to make Germany carbon-neutral by 2045 — and also wean itself off Russian gas.
The Scandinavian country's gas pipeline operator, Gassco, said last year it was looking at building a hydrogen link to Germany by 2030.
Germany is targeting 14 terawatt hours of domestic hydrogen production by 2030 — a dramatic scale-up but one that still falls significantly below the country's projected demand for hydrogen by that date of 90TWh-110TWh.

| Jump to first hitGermany's RWE and Norway's Equinor have agreed to supply Germany with low-emissions hydrogen fuel. The long-term plan is to provide 100% cleanly sourced green hydrogen.The leading energy production companies from Norway and Germany agreed on Thursday to set up facilities to provide Germany with blue hydrogen, during a visit to Oslo by German Economy Minister Robert Habeck.Norway's state-run Equinor and Germany's RWE will invest in new power plants in Germany that will initially burn Norwegian natural gas but will eventually move over to low-carbon blue hydrogen, and finally zero-emissions green hydrogen.The agreement is dependent on a hydrogen pipeline that is currently being considered by the two partners as well as the Norwegian gas system operator Gassco.""We need plants that are ready for hydrogen ... this decarbonized hydrogen should come from Norway,"" Habeck said in a joint press conference with Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere in Oslo.What is blue hydrogen?For years, the prospect of clean hydrogen fuel - which emits mostly water vapor when burned - has excited those hoping to abandon fossil fuels.However, the production of completely clean ""green"" hydrogen, which is separated from water with power generated by clean renewables such as solar and wind, is not currently viable at a large scale.The alternative ""blue"" hydrogen, which is produced by burning gas, remains a cheaper option and aims to capture and store more than 95% of emissions.Norway has become one of Germany's biggest suppliers of gas following the closure of Russian gas pipelines amid the war in Ukraine. Berlin is hoping that Norway can also provide it with clean hydrogen.""There is an urgent need for a rapid ramp up of the hydrogen economy,"" RWE Chief Executive Markus Krebber said in the statement announcing the deal.""Blue hydrogen in large quantities can make a start, with subsequent conversion into green hydrogen supply,"" he added.Environmentalists demand more green energyEnvironmental groups have warned that the development of blue hydrogen facilities is a step in the wrong direction due to their reliance on natural gas.""If we want to put the energy crisis behind us for good, then we need a progressive green energy supply,"" head of the Environmental Action Germany (DUH) Sascha Müller-Kraenner said on Thursday.""Importing blue hydrogen would, however, be a further step backwards to a fossil-fueled past,"" she added.The DUH also protested the arrival of the first regular tanker bringing liquified natural gas (LNG) to Germany that arrived at the port of Wilhelmshaven on Tuesday.Habeck's Green party, one of the three parties in the ruling coalition, has come under fire from its own supporters for promoting LNG as an alternative to Russian gas, as well as permitting the continued burning of coal.Climate activists occupying the abandoned village of Lützerath in western Germany faced off against police on Thursday who have been sent to clear the village so that it can be ripped up for the expansion of a nearby open-pit coal mine.Source: DW - Deutsche Welle"

| Jump to first hitA huge carbon capture power station has won planning permission for the first time in the UK.The Keadby 3 plant in north Lincolnshire is the first carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to be greenlit by the government.The news came the same day as Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove approved a new coal mine in England - the first in 30 years, which will release an estimated 400,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (equivalent to 200,000 extra cars on the roads).Carbon capture technology was part of the justification for allowing a new coal mine - which Gove claimed would be net zero compliant. But commentators were quick to point out the as-yet unproven technology is not in commercial use in the UK.The new CCS project seeks to change that as soon as 2027. It is backed by Britain's SSE Thermal, part of SSE, and Norwegian energy company Equinor - better known as an oil and gas major.Grete Tveit, senior vice president for low carbon solutions at Equinor, describes it as a significant milestone for our joint ambition to deliver clean, flexible and efficient power to support intermittent renewable generation and maintain security of supply.How much carbon will Keadby 3 pull from the air?Business and Energy Secretary Grant Shapps signed off the proposed plant following extensive consultation, SSE said in a statement on its website on Thursday.Keadby 3 would have a generating capacity of up to 910 megawatt (MW) and capture up to 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year, according to SSE. It says this represents at least 5 per cent of the UK government's 2030 target.It will be situated next to Keadby 1 and 2; two gas fired power stations in northern England's Humber region.The plan is for carbon pulled from the air to be sent through CO2 pipelines being built to transport emissions from industrial plants across the Humber to storage under the North Sea.This is subject to final approval and investment; though the plant got a development consent order, the project is still in the due diligence stage of the government's 'cluster sequencing process' for CCS.Advocates of the technology say it has a key role to play in decarbonising the grid. But using CCS alongside gas fired power stations remains controversial among green groups.It is perverse that the world's biggest polluters are in fact using CCS to extract more fossil fuels, creating more emissions, Ken Penton, climate campaigner at Global Witness previously told Euronews Green.The time has now come for governments to stop chasing the CCS unicorn and instead build vibrant renewable energy sectors and massively increase energy efficiency of homes and businesses. The best and most proven way to stop climate change is to keep fossil fuels in the ground.Source: Euronews"

| Jump to first hitOil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is planning a mega carbon capture and storage (CCS) project in collaboration with Norway's Equinor, which would help capture 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually from several emitting industries and store it permanently deep under the seabed off the coast of Gujarat, a company executive said.
ONGC has presented the plan to Niti Aayog, which is leading the policy discussion on carbon capture projects in the country.
The project comprises carbon capture at multiple industrial sites including steel, oil, cement, and power facilities, its evacuation by pipelines to onshore intermediate storage, and further transport via pipeline or ships to a final storage site in the sea, as per the executive who didn't want to be named. The project would take three years to build after the details are finalised.
The project details, including the carbon collection sources and the location of the sink where the captured CO2 will be deposited, as well as the funding, are yet to be worked out.
 Cost Holds Key to Project Viability
 ONGC is already working on a smaller carbon capture and utilisation (CCUS) project with Indian Oil Corp where the CO2 will be captured at the latter's refinery in Gujarat and transported to a nearby ONGC's oilfield for utilisation in its enhanced oil recovery project.
ONGC's mega project to capture and store 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 would require massive investments and financial support from the government. A previous study conducted by ONGC had projected a cost of more than $1 billion for building a carbon capture and storage project with a capacity of 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year.
Carbon capture cost would be key to the viability of the project.
Technological advancements, policy moves to make industrial emitters pay for emissions, and state financial aid would be necessary to make the CCS project viable, industry executives said. High carbon capture cost also means higher operating costs throughout the life of the project.

The ONGC project is inspired by the Northern Lights CO2 capture and storage project that Equinor, Shell and Total are developing in Norway with the funding support of its government. Northern Lights project aims to transport 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 annually to permanently store it 2,600 meters below the seabed of the North Sea. The Northern Lights project will be operational in 2024.
The oil industry has been projecting carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) as a key technological tool in the fight against climate change as it would help lower emissions without curbing the use of fossil fuels. Some of the CCUS facilities have been around since the 1970s and the global carbon capture capacity today is around 40 MtCO2 each year, as per the International Energy Agency."

| Jump to first hitNorway is a powerhouse when it comes to clean energy start-ups, but the country is at odds with its position as a world leader in petroleum and natural gas exports.It is a contradiction that has come into sharper focus this year since the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis.A NATO ally and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member, Norway has proven to be a lifeline to the European Union by becoming the 27-nation bloc's biggest natural gas supplier since Russia cut its gas supplies.The majority of revenue from Norway's oil and gas production is kept in a sovereign wealth fund, which keeps the money for Norwegian citizens and is used in times of economic instability.Since its creation in the 1990s, it has amassed over 1 trillion.Much of the gas and petrol is exported and the bulk of energy used in the country comes from renewables. But how is Norway grappling with the country's energy paradox?'We cannot live like we are now'Energy generated from biological waste holds a lot of promise but the expense and the time it takes have put many off.But Oslo-based company Antec has designed a technology that can convert biowaste into biogas - a renewable source of electricity and clean heat - which produces energy five times faster and cheaper than regular biofuel technology.My father was one of the first people working at Statoil, said Antec CEO Eirik Gundersen, referring to the company which is now called Equinor, Norway's state-owned multi-national oil and gas company.So that [oil and gas] was the talking around the table. And then I had my own kids and I thought we cannot live like we are now. It makes no sense, he told Euronews Next.Gundersen then met his two co-founders, who have backgrounds in biology and microbiology, and they started the company in 2010 when green energy was not even in our lexicon.Fast-forward to July 2022 and Antec opened the country's first renewable biogas plant in Stord, Western Norway, alongside the company RENEVO.Using raw materials from the local fisheries, aquacultural and agricultural sectors, the plant will provide the surrounding region with renewable, clean energy for fuel, liquified biomethane and organic fertiliser for the agriculture sector.Gundersen said Norway has shifted its mentality to focus more on clean energy.From 2019/2020, Norway is starting to talk about the green shift and the global climate challenge, he said.And we were lucky in a way because the market is going with us and a lot of companies and the government want to see us succeed.Proud 'but we are still an oil and gas producer'Investors are also riding the green energy train, which has also partly been fuelled by Russia's war on Ukraine.It's been important for a long time to invest in and it has, of course, been accelerated now with the crisis in Europe and Ukraine, and I think with the high energy prices that we're seeing, it will become more of a trend, Reynir Indahl, managing partner of Norweigan investment group Summa Equity, told Euronews Next.I think the whole transition to renewable and green will go faster, he said.Although we can be very proud that we are energy efficient and going green in Norway. We are still an oil and gas producer.Reynir Indahl Summa EquityBut the clean energy transition still needs time and patience until we become less reliant on oil and gas. And Norway has provided a lifeline to Europe in providing natural gas to the bloc since Russia cut off its supplies.Nevertheless, another big debate in Norway is whether gas exploration should continue.In November, Equinor and its partners announced it would invest 14.8 billion Norwegian kroner (1.44 billion) in developing the Irpa gas discovery project in the Norwegian Sea, which aims to produce around 20 billion cubic metres of natural gas for export to Europe.Although we can be very proud that we are energy efficient and going green in Norway. We are still an oil and gas producer, said Indahl, adding that new explorations are an area where the country doesn't align politically and where the country should be more aggressive.'Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the energy landscape'But with the war and the energy crisis, it is hard to shift just to clean energy.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the energy landscape in Europe forever, and there is sort of no going back to the pre-war status, said Norway's state secretary in Norway's petroleum and energy ministry Andreas Bjelland Eriksen.Europe will need gas also in the future. They will need gas from other sources than Russia, he told Euronews Next.However, progress is being made as EU countries cut gas demand by a quarter in November, according to commodity analytics company ICIS. This is partly due to a warmer autumn but also because of alternative energy sources.Norway is leading efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by diverting away from oil and gas.Russia's invasion of Ukraine has changed the energy landscape in Europe forever, and there is sort of no going back to the pre-war status.Andreas Bjelland Eriksen I think it's hard to see that there are many places where it's more natural to continue to import gas from in a European context than from Norway, said Bjelland Eriksen, adding that the country already has the infrastructure and the lowest emissions from production and is working to continue cutting them.So, I do not necessarily think that there is a sort of a difficult balance between being a gas supplier to Europe also going forward and helping in the energy transition, he added.But I think what we need to continue supplying Europe with gas and develop the new technologies that will play a role in the energy transition.One of the new technologies Bjelland Eriksen is enthusiastic about is hydropower given the country's geography. It also has pedigree in hydro energy, something that was developing even before Norway's oil and gas boom of the 1960s.Wind is another renewable that the government is harnessing.In May, the centre-left government, which has come under fire from environmentalists for continuing to support the oil and gas industry, set a target to develop 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity by 2040.'Now would be a good time to sell off the assets in Equinor'But some say that the efforts by the government to use wind and solar as renewable energies could have come in much sooner.I guess we've had this almost smug view that we don't have to add any new renewables and we've been sluggish on our development on wind power and we've been sort of arrogant towards solar power, believing that it can only be used in the Equator, Andreas Thorsheim Ceo of solar panel installation company Otovo, said.But solar can be used in many climates, even in countries like rainy Norway.Thorsheim said that despite few homes and businesses in the country having solar panels and wind power capacities, it isextremely fast to develop.He said that while Norway is discussing revamping the nuclear programmes, it will not help the current energy crisis.That's going to be great for the next energy crisis in the 2040s. But the one we're having now, it's going to have to be solved by solar and wind, he said.Thorsheim also believes the government can better fund these renewables by selling off some of its 67 per cent shares in Equinor.Now would be a good time to allow for the Norwegian government to sell off the assets in Equinor that aren't in Europe and to use the proceeds of all of this windfall mega gain for Norway, he said.As well as using such proceeds for renewable energies, he also said it could be used for the parts of Europe that are the most affected by this crisis and Ukraine in particular, they're going to have to rebuild their electricity sector, and I hope we can be big contributors to that.'People want to work for the company involved in green energy'As for green hydrogen, which is one of the renewable energies that the European Unione is pushing to meet its climate targets, the company Hystar has developed what it calls the world's most efficient PEM electrolysers, which effectively splits water electrochemically into hydrogen and oxygen.This method makes producing green hydrogen cheaper and more accessible.The growth of Norway's renewable and clean energy companies has also changed the employment market.Ten years ago, everybody wanted to work for the big oil and gas majors, said Hystar's CEO Fredrik Mowill, who has worked in the clean energy sector for 20 years.Just getting people, including graduates, is a lot easier now. People want to work for the company involved in green energy.'I think most people are quite comfortable with having these two thoughts'But those who have previously worked in Norway's oil and gas industry have also changed to work in the renewable and green energy sectors.That's been my life in the oil and gas industry. I have actually been an offshore installation manager, said Maria Moræus Hanssen, chairperson of the board of Wastefront.Now, sitting on the outside, I don't want to necessarily be in that group that just sits and criticises. That's not me. I want the industry to change and I want all the employees to be able to make that transition.The company recycles end-of-life tyres into commodities such as liquid hydrocarbons and carbon black, which can then be used for alternative fuel manufacturing or even to produce ground rubber.I'm super grateful for my career and let's recognise it. I mean, most nations are extremely grateful for the wealth that this industry has provided us with, she said, adding that the whole oil and gas sector is a relatively clean type of industry in Norway.I think most people are quite comfortable with having these two thoughts in their head at the same time.Source: Euronews"

| Jump to first hitBy Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje AaslandMinister of Petroleum and Energy, Terje Aasland, held the concluding remarks at Equinor's Autumn Conference on 29th November 2022 in Oslo, Norway.Ladies and gentlemen, dear energy friends.It is an honour for me to make these closing remarks at the Autumn Conference.This has been an important three hours with valuable insights. The backdrop is serious.We have heard from many distinguished speakers about the numerous challenges we are facing. There are enormous challenges. But challenges are also opportunities.Today has been about how we should manage the energy transition, and how petroleum, renewables and low emission solutions can complement each other in solving the energy trilemma.We have learnt that our future energy use needs to meet Security, Affordability and Decarbonisation.Energy Security rely on robust energy infrastructure, and not least, the ability of energy providers to meet current and future demand.Affordability is equally important. The challenges and pitfalls of the current situation with very high energy prices, whether it is electricity in Norway or gas in Europe, should not be underestimated.It holds an important message to all of us: Access to affordable energy is key for economic growth, businesses and livelihoods across the world.And finally, we must meet the energy demand within the framework of our climate goals and environmental sustainability.But to be clear: The energy transition will take time. To succeed it will be imperative to ensure that the world's population has access to affordable and reliable energy also in the coming decades.In addition, energy demand will rise, due to a growing world population and increasing standards of living.Furthermore, the global production from existing fields will be rapidly reduced without new investments.Therefore, I don't agree with Dr. Fatih Birol telling us earlier today. I think we also need significant exploring and investments.Significant outlays will be required just to halt the annual declines. I am relly sure about that.New energy crises and highly volatile prices will be the result, if the production of oil and gas falls faster than what we manage to replace with new energy sources.It is in this context that I think Norway is seen as a reliable and trusted energy partner with a solid democratic foundation.Our European friends, our allies and trading partners recognise the continued efforts Norway is making to bring oil and gas to the market.My firm conviction is that the most important contribution Norway can make to the global energy supply, is to continue exploration and investment in production on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.Norwegian oil and gas can be produced at a competitive cost and with considerably lower emissions than alternative sources of supply.At the same time, we must take on a special responsibility for developing critical technologies for the global energy transition - such as carbon capture and storage.A massive increase in zero or low emission energy production, energy efficiency and technological development are needed to reduce global emissions, and Norway will contribute.So, in conclusion, the Norwegian Government will continue to develop the Norwegian petroleum sector, build on the competence and technologies from this sector to develop solutions for the future, as well as reduce Norwegian emissions.In this way we will contribute to energy security, affordability and decarbonisation globally.And thank you to Equinor, young 50 year old company that gather us here today.Thank you for your attention!Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitGlobal energy giant Equinor's investment into the Australian offshore wind company, OceanEx has been cleared by the Foreign Investment Review Board, clearing the way for the Norwegian to be the next powerhouse to develop the zero emission energy source.
Equinor in August struck a deal with OceanEx for the Norwegian energy company to jointly develop three offshore wind projects in New South Wales, likely to be the next state to permit the renewable energy source.
""We will now really accelerate quickly to further industry and supply chain development, design great projects and most importantly work with local communities to create world-leading projects,"" said Andy Evans, OceanEx's chief executive officer.
Offshore wind is a key pillar of the Labor government's plan to move aggressively to meet its target of having zero-emission sources make up more than 80 per cent of Australia's electricity mix by 2030. This is a key element of Australia's plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
Equinor and OceanEx will begin work on three offshore wind projects in NSW, each with a proposed generation capacity of 2 gigawatts. The duo hopes to work on the projects simultaneously but this will depend on the regulatory developments. Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen has proposed offshore wind projects be permitted in the Hunter and Illawarra, both sites Equinor and OceanEx hope to develop in, but public consultations must occur before developers can seek a feasibility licence.
A pipeline of offshore wind projects in NSW is emerging. The Financial Review revealed last week that more than $30 billion of offshore wind projects in Illawarra had been registered with the NSW government.
An offshore wind target would offer developers demand certainty, incentivising renewable energy companies to commit billions of dollars.
Victoria earlier this year said it planned to generate 20 per cent of its energy needs from offshore wind by the end of the decade, a target that has ignited a race to develop large-scale projects.
Victoria's target climbs to 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040 - a level that some say would further accelerate the demise of coal power. A plethora of global heavyweights, including Shell, Macquarie, Spain's EDP Renewables and France's ENGIE are plotting developments in Gippsland. A formal declaration that the region is open to offshore wind developments is expected within weeks.

Though Europe has filled its reserves of natural gas for this winter, the clock is already ticking to secure energy for the coming years, which are expected to remain dogged by threats of severe shortages.
The European Union's gas storage is around 95% full, and many analysts say the continent might avoid an energy calamity this winter. But procuring gas for coming winters is widely anticipated to become more difficult for European countries now that they are mostly cut off from Russian supplies and global competition is growing for finite cargoes of liquefied natural gas.
There is little additional LNG coming to the market until around 2026, when planned projects in the U.S. and Qatar come online, and Europe likely will compete for tight supplies over the next few years.
Some companies in Germany, Europe's manufacturing engine, are worried about having enough energy for the latter part of the decade. German companies including chemical producer BASF SE and bailed-out utility Uniper SE have held talks in recent weeks with America's LNG exporters and others about potential gas-supply deals likely beginning after mid-decade, according to people familiar with the discussions.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, some European companies signed contracts for U.S. LNG. Now businesses that rely on gas are saying the continent will need more of it for years to come.
The negotiations are indicative of elevated energy-security concerns, the people said, but are complicated because while many in Europe seek gas for five to 10 years, some company and government officials are reluctant to sign longer-term supply contracts. Germany and other European nations have set ambitious targets to reduce fossil-fuel consumption dramatically, and companies are worried they could be on the hook for gas they no longer need.
BASF and Uniper are looking for ways to source more natural gas, including through LNG, spokespersons for the companies said.
German government officials are monitoring the discussions about gas supplies, including separate talks with the Norwegian oil-and-gas company Equinor ASA, at times suggesting companies that exporters should contact, some of the people familiar with the discussions said.
A spokeswoman for Germany's Economy and Climate Ministry said gas purchases are the responsibility of companies.
Equinor Chief Executive Anders Opedal said in a recent interview: ""We are working closely with German industry to find common ground for potential future investments,"" in oil and gas as well as low-carbon energy.
EU officials have proposed forming a collective of European companies to coordinate gas-deal talks and jointly purchase fuel, thus avoiding bidding against each other for the same gas. In October, German Finance Minister Christian Lindner expressed support for the idea. But some company executives and government officials doubt such a program would work because of gas-market complexities and differing needs among countries, and some companies are going it alone in negotiations.
""We are not totally convinced about the benefits and advantages that can be achieved by bundling the gas procurement on a European level,"" said a spokeswoman for RWE AG, a German utility that signed a nonbinding 15-year-deal with the U.S. LNG exporter Sempra Infrastructure in May. She said RWE is urging government officials to support long-term gas contracts.
German companies aren't alone in seeking to secure gas. Countries including France and the U.K. face threats of power shortages, and U.S. LNG executives have been calling on European governments looking for deals. A subsidiary of the British chemical company Ineos Group AG signed a nonbinding supply agreement with Sempra earlier this year, as did the Polish energy company Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA.
A spokesman for the U.K. government said it is working with domestic and international suppliers to explore contracts that could increase the security of energy supply.
Political opposition remains in some corners to long-term gas deals that some say could derail climate goals aimed at lowering greenhouse-gas emissions. ""It's difficult to see how they're compatible with decarbonization plans,"" said Jill Duggan, executive director for Europe at the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund.
German officials previously said they expect the country's natural-gas demand to peak around 2030, then give way to more renewable energy.
The tension between Europe's immediate energy needs and long-term climate aspirations are creating a complicated market for European buyers as well as U.S. sellers. Developers of LNG projects need to sign long-term contracts with customers to finance plants that convert gas into liquid for export.
Some Europeans are looking for ways to satisfy exporters while maintaining climate objectives. One option being considered is to sign long-term deals and resell a portion of the gas in foreign markets in later years, which most U.S. LNG contracts allow, according to company executives, bankers and others briefed on the talks.

Another option being discussed is for buyers to invest directly in LNG projects and sign shorter-term supply contracts, allowing them to unload the equity stake later, some of the people said.
People involved in deal talks said other gaps remain between buyers and sellers . European buyers want lower prices from U.S. sellers, arguing that they have already profited handsomely from Europe's energy crisis. U.S. sellers say buyers don't appreciate the inflation and transportation costs and financial risks the companies are bearing, noting that prices are expected to rise again in coming months and years.
Commonwealth LNG, which is developing a new U.S. LNG plant in southern Louisiana, is open to 10-year contracts, but at a higher price compared with a 20-year deal, said Paul Varello, the company's executive chairman. A shorter contract would require an exporter to amortize debt over a shorter period.
""It's safe to say companies who can offer flexible [contract duration] and flexibility around pricing"" will sign deals with Europeans, Mr. Varello said.
Disagreements over the urgency of potential gas shortages are a sticking point. Some German officials have suggested recently in private discussions that they feel less pressure to reach gas-supply deals before year-end, citing lower prices and better than expected storage volume, according to people familiar with the discussions. Some European business executives worry that the cushion is only temporary, and a lack of political will creates risks for future winters.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency warned this month that Europe risks being unable to meet its energy needs next year and urged it to do more to conserve the gas it has and switch to other, renewable energy sources. Europe's natural-gas shortfall in summer 2023 could reach 30 billion cubic meters, according to IEA estimates, or a good chunk of what the bloc needs to refill its gas-storage network before winter returns.
""Europe basically needs to do everything it can,"" said Keisuke Sadamori, the IEA's director for energy markets and security.

The Biden administration wants to spark a US offshore wind power boom, raising production from less than 1 gigawatt today to 30GW by the end of the decade — enough for 10mn homes.
But executives are increasingly concerned that myriad challenges facing the sector are pushing that target beyond reach: permitting is too slow, leases are too expensive, equipment is in short supply and inflation is soaring, they say.
The mix of trepidation and excitement was on show at the ACP Offshore Windpower conference in Providence, Rhode Island, in the past week, where 2,000 delegates gathered to discuss the industry's future.
""I think you could paint a picture — if there continues to be significant delays and projects that are already in the pipeline getting pushed back — then it will be more difficult to meet that 30 by '30 target,"" said Molly Morris, incoming US offshore wind chief at Equinor, the Norwegian energy group.
The offshore wind industry, powered by turbines installed at sea, is well established in Europe. The US federal government and coastal states have more recently embraced the technology, with president Joe Biden making it a pillar of his drive to decarbonise the country's power grid and put it on a path to net zero emissions.
Turbine blades are set to begin spinning next year at the 800-megawatt
Vineyard Wind development off Massachusetts, the first commercial-scale offshore project in the US. Dozens more are set to follow as investors rush for a piece of the action.
Obtaining permits was a central worry for many developers gathered at the Providence event, who said environmental reviews needed to be speedier and carried out with more consistency and transparency.
""Our concern is that this could end up being a very difficult bottleneck,"" Morris said. ""If we don't get these projects that are in the forefront ... permitted, then it's very difficult to really get this industry off the ground.""
Executives also pointed to problems with the process for leasing. An auction for a section of federal waters off New York and New Jersey in February gener- ated high bids totalling $4.4bn, more than any offshore oil and gas sale. But some developers said the high price point sapped capital and made it difficult to turn a profit.
Companies including Equinor and Denmark's Orsted pulled out of the bidding process as prices escalated. David Hardy, head of Orsted's North American business, told the Financial Times at the time that the auction was a ""missed opportunity"".
""I don't think it's healthy to have these super-high lease prices,"" said Mark Mitchell, senior vice-president for project construction at Dominion, a US utility building a wind farm off Virginia. ""Right now that money just goes in and it doesn't necessarily benefit those customers that ultimately take that power.""
Dominion is also embroiled in a regulatory stand-off over Virginia's insistence on a performance standard that would force it to cover the costs of replacement power if the wind farm underperforms targets. The company has threatened to pull the plug over what it describes as ""untenable""
costs associated with the provision.
The Biden administration says it is working with developers to resolve concerns as it looks to build the industry up ""from the ground floor"". Amanda Lefton, director of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said: ""We have significantly evolved our processes and continue to do so.""
""We are absolutely going to achieve the goals of this administration for 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030. We are also poised to go well beyond that,"" she told the FT.
Availability of equipment is a growing challenge for the industry — a problem being exacerbated by some states' insistence on the use of local parts and labour as a condition of winning power sales contracts.
""There are only so many resources that are available that can support the size of the turbines that we're going to be installing here in the US,"" said Amy McGinty, head of offshore construction at Vestas, the turbine manufacturer. ""Whether it's vessels, cranes, transport capacity, factory capacity — we are having to make commitments now ... for projects that we're going to be building in '25, '26, '27 and beyond.""
US law prohibits the use of foreignflagged vessels to transport parts be- tween domestic ports. This restriction could be tightened under legislation being considered in Congress that would also require installation vessels, which operate away from ports, also to be crewed by US mariners. Developers say this could stop the industry in its tracks.
""I think people need to weigh all the factors to make sure there's transition times to make sure you don't immediately strand the market,"" Mitchell said. ""Because these large vessels and re- sources, they're just not swapped overnight. You've got to have time to do it.""
For equipment manufacturers, global inflationary pressures are adding to anxieties. ""We're in this industry that's taking off like a rocket ship,"" said Steven Dayney, head of the offshore wind business at Siemens Gamesa, the turbine maker.
""Yet, many of us across the entire value chain are struggling to do it at a profit that allows us to continue investing ... technology,"" he added.'There are only so many resources available that can support the size of the turbines that we're going to be installing'

A warning from President Biden could dampen the party atmosphere for Big Oil's expected third-quarter earnings bonanza.
Biden, who is worried about high gasoline prices, said last week that oil companies should be more focused on increasing oil supplies to bring down prices than on rewarding shareholders. ""My message to the American energy companies is this: You should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends,"" he said in a speech at the White House. ""Not now. Not while a war is raging.""
The message complicates earnings season for companies that are otherwise in the strongest shape they've been in for years . While shareholders want them to spend more cash on payouts, there's political pressure to limit those rewards. Similarly, European companies will have to assuage concerns in Europe about high commodity prices, even as they accelerate efforts to grow low-carbon businesses.
There's no doubt earnings will be high, and will outpace companies in every other sector. The average S&P 500 stock is expected to increase its earnings 1.8% year over year in the third quarter. The average energy stock in the index is expected to grow earnings 118%. For investors, two issues will hang over the results—whether their stocks will respond to the windfalls, and what the companies will do with all that money.
Starting on Thursday, Big Oil companies in Europe and the U.S. will begin reporting their third quarter results. The five best-known oil majors—Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Shell (SHEL), BP (BP) and TotalEnergies (TTE)—are on track to earn $50 billion collectively, up from $15 billion a year earlier but down from about $60 billion in the second quarter. Add in Norwegian giant Equinor (EQNR) and earnings could reach $57 billion. Shell and TotalEnergies report on Thursday, with Exxon, Chevron and Equinor going on Friday. BP releases earnings next Tuesday.
The expected earnings decline from second-quarter highs is due to lower oil prices in the third quarter and a decline in margins for refining and chemicals businesses. ""The third quarter was the first time in nine consecutive quarters the average oil price sequentially fell, causing free cash flow for most oil-levered operators to decline versus the record highs of the second quarter,"" wrote Truist analyst Neal Dingmann.
In a pre-earnings release, Exxon told investors that its chemicals and refining businesses were down compared with the second quarter. In the second quarter, tight refining capacity and high demand caused margins for gasoline and diesel to soar. Margins remain high, especially for diesel, but have dropped for other products like gasoline.
In general, oil and gas stocks have performed well, but there's been a divide for the big names. The U.S. stocks have been outperforming their European counterparts, climbing 59% over the past year. The European stocks are up 13% for the same period. Investors are skeptical of the decision by European companies to spend more on renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Broader economic weakness in Europe has also hurt the companies there.
One thing that both the U.S. and European stocks have is high dividends and strong buyback programs. BP leads the pack with a dividend yield of 4.5%, followed by TotalEnergies at 4.3%, Equinor at 3.8%, Shell at 3.7%, Exxon at 3.3% and Chevron at 3.2%. The question now is whether companies can comfortably raise those dividends and buybacks without attracting the ire of the government, and perhaps higher tax rates. In the U.K. and EU, oil companies already face windfall-profit taxes. Some lawmakers in the U.S. have proposed a windfall tax too.
The other question hanging over earnings is whether the stocks already have strong results baked in.
Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate argued in a recent note that oil and gas stocks can't escape the negative dynamics that are afflicting the rest of the market, so they may not get much of a bump from earnings. He noted that energy's ""recent performance has converged on broader market volatility, a potent reminder that the US oils are 'equities first' with rising interest rates and rising risk premiums denting valuations irrespective of what we continue to view as a constructive commodity outlook."" Leggate likes stocks he thinks have specific catalysts that can lift them above the average company. One of those is Exxon, which is growing production off Guyana and in the Permian Basin, and adding more investments in liquefied natural gas.

Just two years ago, the world's giant oil producers seemed to be going the way of the typewriter industry. No one wanted oil—the price of a barrel fell below zero early in the pandemic. Exxon Mobil's stock crashed hard and was dumped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 92 years. It was starting to look like a prelude to the real extinction—the world's transition to clean energy.
So much for that. The plunge turned into a surge, and the top oil-and-gas companies ended up rolling in cash. Exxon (ticker: XOM) is now a stock market star, with a gain of more than 60% in the turmoil of the past 12 months. Chevron (CVX) is up nearly 50%. What's more, the future has brightened considerably. Instead of being destroyed by the energy transition, Big Oil has emerged in a remarkably strong position to profit from it.
Because of deals signed in just the past year, companies like BP (BP), Shell (SHEL), Exxon, and Chevron are building enough offshore wind farms to supply millions of homes on the East Coast with electricity and are preparing to produce hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel made from plants, garbage, and kitchen grease. They're increasingly confident that they can get greener without sacrificing profits.
What saved the companies was a rebound in commodity prices, which climbed gradually before ripping higher when Russia invaded Ukraine. Those premium prices don't look like they're going anywhere. Most analysts expect oil to stay above $80 for the foreseeable future because demand is set to exceed supply. Generally, oil producers can deliver handsome profits as long as oil trades above $60 a barrel, analysts say.
Big Oil, which also includes France's TotalEnergies (TTE) and Norway's Equinor (EQNR), went from having problems to having options. In the next few years, the companies will have enough money to fund all of their drilling, pay off debt, send dividends to shareholders, and still place large bets on low-carbon businesses. New government subsidies for carbon-reduction technologies, both in the U.S. and Europe, will give those investments a nice kick.
Already, the transition is well under way. Renewable energy could account for 60% of power generation in Western Europe and 35% in the U.S. by 2030, up from 35% and 23%, respectively, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Companies everywhere are rushing to keep pace: Total capital investments in renewables in 2022 are on track to exceed oil and gas investments for the first year ever, according to Rystad Energy, a research firm based in Norway.
Still, convincing investors and the general public that Big Oil is changing won't be easy. Two companies that could profit from clean energy, Exxon and BP, happen to be associated with the most notorious environmental disasters of the past 40 years—the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker and the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. And Big Oil long has been accused of misleading the public about the danger of climate change and slow-footing their transition efforts.
The size of the checks that big oil companies are signing today makes a compelling case that their investments aren't just window-dressing. Earlier this month, Exxon inked a contract to help a corporate customer capture and store millions of tons of carbon dioxide underground, equivalent to switching 700,000 cars from gasoline engines to electric motors, the company says. BP just agreed to pay $4.1 billion for a company that replaces fossil-fuel gas from wells with naturally occurring biogas from landfills, one step in its goal to produce zero net-carbon emissions from the products it sells by 2050; some others have only said they'd reduce the emissions from their own operations.
Both stocks, however, trade as if the oil businesses are on the decline and the new projects will mostly be busts. BP fetches less than four times expected 2022 earnings, and Exxon, for less than eight, or about half of the multiple of the broad market. That could make for good entry points to the stocks.
The companies say their climate projects are likely to reward investors, though they will take time to scale up. ""We see an opportunity for a lot of growth and solid returns,"" says Dan Ammann, who leads Exxon's low-carbon efforts.
The U.S. companies have announced much less ambitious emissions-reduction projects than their European counterparts, and seem much less willing to invest in wind and solar, where they say they don't have competitive advantages.
In Europe, politics and social pressure have helped force more-aggressive moves. London-based Shell, for instance, says it will spend about half of its capital budget on low-carbon divisions by 2025. TotalEnergies and Equinor have also set lofty goals. Uncertainty about the results of those investments, and the shock of the European economic crisis, have caused their stocks to trail those of American energy companies over the past year.
Exxon has said it will invest only in low-carbon businesses that it thinks can generate returns on capital of at least 10%. BP has said it's targeting 8% to 10%. At today's sky-high oil prices, several companies are earning returns exceeding 20% on their fossil-fuel businesses, which can make those 10% levels look puny. But remember, oil producers spent 2016 to 2019 earning 0%, because they spent too much money on the wrong projects at the wrong time.
Oil and gas drilling is a volatile business—there's something to be said for a safe 10% return over a risky 20% one. ""The reality of how these [fossil fuel] projects play out isn't always as"" financial models predict, says McDermott. Renewables businesses have less commodity exposure and are more likely to be buttressed by government support or longer-term utility-style contracts.
Ironically, high fossil-fuel prices are the biggest reason that producers have the wherewithal to fund the energy transition. The world's oil-and-gas companies are on pace to generate $1.4 trillion of free cash flow this year, according to Deloitte's estimates. Free cash includes money left over after the companies pay for their operations, but before they spend money on dividends and buybacks, and pay off debt. Even after accounting for all of those costs, oil and gas producers should still have $1.5 trillion left over by 2030, with 70% of that excess cash piling up by 2024, according to Deloitte. That's more than the entire size of the renewable-energy industry today, excluding electric vehicles.
The oil-and-gas companies won't spend it all on renewables, of course, but they've now got the funds to make serious bets without bankrupting their core businesses. Deloitte projects that oil majors will spend 15% to 30% of their capital funds on low-carbon projects by 2030, up from 5% today—with some, including Shell, spending 50% or more.
There's some cognitive dissonance, of course, in listening to ""low carbon"" pitches from fossil-fuel companies. Arguably, the best thing the companies could do for the environment would be to quickly wind down their operations. All new drilling would have to stop immediately for the world to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the International Energy Agency said last year. But as long as demand exists for oil and gas products, the disappearance of some producers, even some of the biggest, wouldn't change the climate equation much. Demand has already rebounded nearly to its old highs and is expected to hit records next year.
Some critics of Big Oil's push into renewables object on financial grounds. ""We're concerned about the returns from these projects,"" said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management, which owns shares of Chevron, ConocoPhillips (COP), and other oil companies. Renewables are diluting the financial power of the big oil companies, he argues. Smead would rather that companies like Chevron spend the money to buy other oil companies.
Chevron, for one, says that it can invest in both new and old energy quite profitably. ""These businesses need to generate attractive returns,"" says Jeff Gustavson, the president of Chevron New Energies. They just may take time to come to fruition. ""It's not dissimilar from our exploration business where we're drilling exploration wells that have different probabilities of success."" Gustavson previously oversaw some of Chevron's drilling operations.
Some climate-conscious investors, meanwhile, say they'll wait and see if these companies do more than just test new business lines. ""This rhetoric has been going on for long enough that I think investors are going to wait till there's steel in the ground,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, an environment-focused shareholder advocacy organization. Ceres played a role in a successful effort to flip three board seats at Exxon in 2021 in the hopes of making the company more climate-conscious.
Still, the notion of Big Oil playing a major part in the transition to clean energy seems more plausible with each passing month. ""These are not names that the average consumer associates with clean energy. But ultimately, these incumbents do bring certain positives to the mix, particularly their balance sheets,"" Logan said. Despite piling on debt to make it through the depths of the pandemic, the companies have since paid off much of it. The big players are less levered-up than they were at the end of 2019.
Big Oil also will be helped by the way the green transition is being built and funded. Governments are contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the effort, but for the most part, they're not drilling the holes and pounding the steel. Companies with the equipment and staff to complete those tasks, and historical knowledge of how to handle and transport gases and other fuels, are in a strong position. The U.S. government is spending $369 billion on energy subsidies, loans, and tax credits, the result of the big climate and tax bill that President Joe Biden signed in August. Europe has already started spending what will amount to hundreds of billions.
The companies' financial clout means they can afford to take their time and even make some mistakes. Investors have a margin of safety, too, since the stocks are trading at such low price/earnings ratios.
Part of the problem for the stocks is that they can't seem to attract generalist investors, who don't like their history of weak returns and the damage the companies do to the climate. But some climate-concerned institutional investors have signaled that they're open to a different approach—forceful engagement, rather than divestment.
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has vowed to prune fossil fuels from the state's $226 billion pension fund, but has opposed full divestment. Instead, a committee is reviewing which of the big oil-and-gas companies really are aiming to move toward cleaner fuels; the state plans to keep investing in those. ""Some companies that are at greatest climate change risk are also capable of providing the greatest investment opportunities"" because they can adapt, his office wrote in response to questions from Barron's. ""Simply wiping away an entire sector, that has a significant diversity of companies within it, is not usually viewed as thoughtful investing.""
BP makes a solid case that it's really changing. The London-based company has said that by 2025 it will invest at least 40% of its capital budget in five areas meant to transition away from oil and gas production—bioenergy, convenience (which includes an expansion of gas stations), electric-vehicle charging, renewables, and hydrogen. BP and Norway's Equinor are installing wind turbines off the East Coast of the U.S. capable of providing 4.4 gigawatts of power, or enough to power more than 2½ million homes. With its agreement this past week to purchase leading renewable natural-gas producer Archaea Energy (LFG), BP is on track to become one of the key biofuels producers in the U.S. Its oil production, meanwhile, is set to decline by 40% by 2030 from the level in 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Environmentalists have applauded BP's net zero announcement, but they want verification that the company will follow through. This isn't the first time the energy giant has said that it would transition to cleaner energy. Twenty years ago, the company dubbed itself ""beyond petroleum"" and announced aggressive plans to invest in wind and solar. Although it bought renewable assets, the effort didn't amount to much. BP sold many of its wind and solar assets a decade ago, before its recent turnabout.
""We were ahead of where society was in terms of acceptance,"" says Dave Lawler, chairman and president of bp America. ""This time, though, if you look at the climate, if you look at the Rivians, the Teslas, the focus on carbon capture, the latest laws that have been passed, this is the inflection point for society. We think we're in step with that.""
BP has begun detailing the financial impacts of the shift. By 2030, the company expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, from the new businesses to top $10 billion. To put that in perspective, the company's total Ebitda in 2019 came to $34 billion.
Assuming that its profit margins from fossil fuels stay consistent, the company should be able weather declining production and pull in at least $30 billion annually by 2030—$20 billion from the traditional businesses and $10 billion from the new one. And given the rate at which it's buying its own stock—at least $4 billion in annual repurchases through 2025—those earnings will be spread across a smaller number of shares, helping earnings per share.
Perhaps the biggest draw for now is a 4.8% dividend yield, and the company's plans to increase the payout by 4% a year. Longer term, BP's renewable plans look realistic and clearly profitable, wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats earlier this year in upgrading the shares to Overweight. The company is investing in ""well-defined markets where BP has increasingly well-defined plans,"" he wrote.
That, combined with strong returns from oil and gas, makes the shares look undervalued. Rats sees the London-traded stock rising to 566 pence, or $6.35, for a 23% gain before accounting for dividends.
The outlook for Exxon also seems strong, though low carbon is a smaller part of the business and is likely to stay that way for the next several years. The company has pledged to spend $15 billion on hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture, and a few other areas by 2027, roughly 11% of its expected capital budget. The August climate bill offered substantial support for several of its plans. Most notably, Exxon aims to become one of the biggest players in carbon capture and storage, a process of harnessing carbon emissions from fossil-fuel plants, compressing them and storing them underground indefinitely. It's one of the few ways to decarbonize heavy industry like steel-making, but it does face challenges. Critics say that most carbon-capture projects have failed to reach their goals, and that the money could be better spent on other technologies that they view as more effective. Major carbon emitters should be replaced, not just mitigated, the critics say.
""This idea that we should invest in ways to prolong the use of fossil fuels, when you can have cleaner, cheaper energies—the jury's still out, but the indications don't seem promising,"" says Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit that helps shareholders advocate for climate policies.
Fans of carbon capture say that enhanced subsidies and better technology mean it's more likely to succeed now. Exxon, which has already been capturing carbon to use in oil pumping, is ready to bet big.
Earlier this month, it announced its first commercial project to store carbon underground, working with a pipeline company and fertilizer producer CF Industries to capture and sequester two million metric tons of carbon a year at a Louisiana plant. The companies didn't release the economics of their deal, but the government subsidies alone should provide $170 million of support annually. ""We have a tremendous amount of internal existing expertise on this,"" says Exxon's Ammann.
Given the ""relatively modest amount of capital"" the company is deploying and the amount of carbon that will be kept out of the atmosphere, ""I think that has a very high payback, not just from a financial point of view, but in terms of the environmental benefit,"" Ammann says.
Exxon's 10% low-carbon profit hurdle, experts say, should be achievable for a fertilizer project like this (decarbonizing steel and coal will be less profitable).
And this is just the start. With over a dozen partners, Exxon has ambitions to capture and store 50 million metric tons of carbon from industrial companies along the Gulf Coast near Houston by 2030.
McDermott, the Morgan Stanley analyst, thinks Exxon stock is worth buying primarily for its oil-and-gas potential, which remains strong because of projects in the U.S. and overseas that the company started in recent years. But he thinks the low-carbon work will also pay off, and that Exxon will get more aggressive, raising its capital investments to $22.4 billion by 2027 from the current target of $15 billion.
The new law ""opens up a broader set of opportunities in the low-carbon market,"" he says. He also thinks the company can earn returns closer to 15%, and generate low-carbon earnings of $4.1 billion by 2030 and $8.2 billion by 2035. He sees the stock climbing to $113 over the next year from a recent $104.
Asked why Exxon isn't investing as much as BP, given the prospects for renewables, Ammann says that more substantial investments are on their way. ""You should measure the progress on the projects and the results from those projects. We have a very large backlog of projects that we're working on, and you'll see more to come from us.""
Consumers may never associate Big Oil with a green world. But if renewables bring real profits, the companies' dirty baggage will weigh less heavily on their stocks.

Earlier this month, Exxon inked a contract to help a corporate customer capture and store millions of tons of carbon dioxide underground, equivalent to switching 700,000 cars from gasoline engines to electric motors, the company says. BP just agreed to pay $4.1 billion for a company that replaces fossil-fuel gas from wells with naturally occurring biogas from landfills, one step in its goal to produce zero net-carbon emissions from the products it sells by 2050; some others have only said they'd reduce the emissions from their own operations.
Both stocks, however, trade as if the oil businesses are on the decline and the new projects will mostly be busts. BP fetches less than four times expected 2022 earnings, and Exxon, for less than eight, or about half of the multiple of the broad market. That could make for good entry points to the stocks.
The companies say their climate projects are likely to reward investors, though they will take time to scale up. ""We see an opportunity for a lot of growth and solid returns,"" says Dan Ammann, who leads Exxon's low-carbon efforts.
The U.S. companies have announced much less ambitious emissions-reduction projects than their European counterparts, and seem much less willing to invest in wind and solar, where they say they don't have competitive advantages.
In Europe, politics and social pressure have helped force more-aggressive moves. London-based Shell, for instance, says it will spend about half of its capital budget on low-carbon divisions by 2025. TotalEnergies and Equinor have also set lofty goals. Uncertainty about the results of those investments, and the shock of the European economic crisis, have caused their stocks to trail those of American energy companies over the past year.
Exxon has said it will invest only in low-carbon businesses that it thinks can generate returns on capital of at least 10%. BP has said it's targeting 8% to 10%. At today's sky-high oil prices, several companies are earning returns exceeding 20% on their fossil-fuel businesses, which can make those 10% levels look puny. But remember, oil producers spent 2016 to 2019 earning 0%, because they spent too much money on the wrong projects at the wrong time.
Oil and gas drilling is a volatile business—there's something to be said for a safe 10% return over a risky 20% one. ""The reality of how these [fossil fuel] projects play out isn't always as"" financial models predict, says McDermott. Renewables businesses have less commodity exposure and are more likely to be buttressed by government support or longer-term utility-style contracts.
Ironically, high fossil-fuel prices are the biggest reason that producers have the wherewithal to fund the energy transition. The world's oil-and-gas companies are on pace to generate $1.4 trillion of free cash flow this year, according to Deloitte's estimates. Free cash includes money left over after the companies pay for their operations, but before they spend money on dividends and buybacks, and pay off debt. Even after accounting for all of those costs, oil and gas producers should still have $1.5 trillion left over by 2030, with 70% of that excess cash piling up by 2024, according to Deloitte. That's more than the entire size of the renewable-energy industry today, excluding electric vehicles.
The oil-and-gas companies won't spend it all on renewables, of course, but they've now got the funds to make serious bets without bankrupting their core businesses. Deloitte projects that oil majors will spend 15% to 30% of their capital funds on low-carbon projects by 2030, up from 5% today—with some, including Shell, spending 50% or more.
There's some cognitive dissonance, of course, in listening to ""low carbon"" pitches from fossil-fuel companies. Arguably, the best thing the companies could do for the environment would be to quickly wind down their operations. All new drilling would have to stop immediately for the world to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, the International Energy Agency said last year. But as long as demand exists for oil and gas products, the disappearance of some producers, even some of the biggest, wouldn't change the climate equation much. Demand has already rebounded nearly to its old highs and is expected to hit records next year.
Some critics of Big Oil's push into renewables object on financial grounds. ""We're concerned about the returns from these projects,"" said Cole Smead, president of Smead Capital Management, which owns shares of Chevron, ConocoPhillips (COP), and other oil companies. Renewables are diluting the financial power of the big oil companies, he argues. Smead would rather that companies like Chevron spend the money to buy other oil companies.
Chevron, for one, says that it can invest in both new and old energy quite profitably. ""These businesses need to generate attractive returns,"" says Jeff Gustavson, the president of Chevron New Energies. They just may take time to come to fruition. ""It's not dissimilar from our exploration business where we're drilling exploration wells that have different probabilities of success."" Gustavson previously oversaw some of Chevron's drilling operations.
Some climate-conscious investors, meanwhile, say they'll wait and see if these companies do more than just test new business lines. ""This rhetoric has been going on for long enough that I think investors are going to wait till there's steel in the ground,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of oil and gas at Ceres, an environment-focused shareholder advocacy organization. Ceres played a role in a successful effort to flip three board seats at Exxon in 2021 in the hopes of making the company more climate-conscious.
Still, the notion of Big Oil playing a major part in the transition to clean energy seems more plausible with each passing month. ""These are not names that the average consumer associates with clean energy. But ultimately, these incumbents do bring certain positives to the mix, particularly their balance sheets,"" Logan said. Despite piling on debt to make it through the depths of the pandemic, the companies have since paid off much of it. The big players are less levered-up than they were at the end of 2019.
Big Oil also will be helped by the way the green transition is being built and funded. Governments are contributing hundreds of billions of dollars to the effort, but for the most part, they're not drilling the holes and pounding the steel. Companies with the equipment and staff to complete those tasks, and historical knowledge of how to handle and transport gases and other fuels, are in a strong position. The U.S. government is spending $369 billion on energy subsidies, loans, and tax credits, the result of the big climate and tax bill that President Joe Biden signed in August. Europe has already started spending what will amount to hundreds of billions.
The companies' financial clout means they can afford to take their time and even make some mistakes. Investors have a margin of safety, too, since the stocks are trading at such low price/earnings ratios.
Part of the problem for the stocks is that they can't seem to attract generalist investors, who don't like their history of weak returns and the damage the companies do to the climate. But some climate-concerned institutional investors have signaled that they're open to a different approach—forceful engagement, rather than divestment.
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli has vowed to prune fossil fuels from the state's $226 billion pension fund, but has opposed full divestment. Instead, a committee is reviewing which of the big oil-and-gas companies really are aiming to move toward cleaner fuels; the state plans to keep investing in those. ""Some companies that are at greatest climate change risk are also capable of providing the greatest investment opportunities"" because they can adapt, his office wrote in response to questions from Barron's. ""Simply wiping away an entire sector, that has a significant diversity of companies within it, is not usually viewed as thoughtful investing.""
BP makes a solid case that it's really changing. The London-based company has said that by 2025 it will invest at least 40% of its capital budget in five areas meant to transition away from oil and gas production—bioenergy, convenience (which includes an expansion of gas stations), electric-vehicle charging, renewables, and hydrogen. BP and Norway's Equinor are installing wind turbines off the East Coast of the U.S. capable of providing 4.4 gigawatts of power, or enough to power more than 2½ million homes. With its agreement this past week to purchase leading renewable natural-gas producer Archaea Energy (LFG), BP is on track to become one of the key biofuels producers in the U.S. Its oil production, meanwhile, is set to decline by 40% by 2030 from the level in 2019, the last year before the Covid-19 pandemic.
Environmentalists have applauded BP's net zero announcement, but they want verification that the company will follow through. This isn't the first time the energy giant has said that it would transition to cleaner energy. Twenty years ago, the company dubbed itself ""beyond petroleum"" and announced aggressive plans to invest in wind and solar. Although it bought renewable assets, the effort didn't amount to much. BP sold many of its wind and solar assets a decade ago, before its recent turnabout.
""We were ahead of where society was in terms of acceptance,"" says Dave Lawler, chairman and president of bp America. ""This time, though, if you look at the climate, if you look at the Rivians, the Teslas, the focus on carbon capture, the latest laws that have been passed, this is the inflection point for society. We think we're in step with that.""
BP has begun detailing the financial impacts of the shift. By 2030, the company expects its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, from the new businesses to top $10 billion. To put that in perspective, the company's total Ebitda in 2019 came to $34 billion.
Assuming that its profit margins from fossil fuels stay consistent, the company should be able weather declining production and pull in at least $30 billion annually by 2030—$20 billion from the traditional businesses and $10 billion from the new one. And given the rate at which it's buying its own stock—at least $4 billion in annual repurchases through 2025—those earnings will be spread across a smaller number of shares, helping earnings per share.
Perhaps the biggest draw for now is a 4.8% dividend yield, and the company's plans to increase the payout by 4% a year. Longer term, BP's renewable plans look realistic and clearly profitable, wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Martijn Rats earlier this year in upgrading the shares to Overweight. The company is investing in ""well-defined markets where BP has increasingly well-defined plans,"" he wrote.
That, combined with strong returns from oil and gas, makes the shares look undervalued. Rats sees the London-traded stock rising to 566 pence, or $6.35, for a 23% gain before accounting for dividends.
The outlook for Exxon also seems strong, though low carbon is a smaller part of the business and is likely to stay that way for the next several years. The company has pledged to spend $15 billion on hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture, and a few other areas by 2027, roughly 11% of its expected capital budget. The August climate bill offered substantial support for several of its plans. Most notably, Exxon aims to become one of the biggest players in carbon capture and storage, a process of harnessing carbon emissions from fossil-fuel plants, compressing them and storing them underground indefinitely. It's one of the few ways to decarbonize heavy industry like steel-making, but it does face challenges. Critics say that most carbon-capture projects have failed to reach their goals, and that the money could be better spent on other technologies that they view as more effective. Major carbon emitters should be replaced, not just mitigated, the critics say.
""This idea that we should invest in ways to prolong the use of fossil fuels, when you can have cleaner, cheaper energies—the jury's still out, but the indications don't seem promising,"" says Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, a nonprofit that helps shareholders advocate for climate policies.
Fans of carbon capture say that enhanced subsidies and better technology mean it's more likely to succeed now. Exxon, which has already been capturing carbon to use in oil pumping, is ready to bet big.
Earlier this month, it announced its first commercial project to store carbon underground, working with a pipeline company and fertilizer producer CF Industries to capture and sequester two million metric tons of carbon a year at a Louisiana plant. The companies didn't release the economics of their deal, but the government subsidies alone should provide $170 million of support annually. ""We have a tremendous amount of internal existing expertise on this,"" says Exxon's Ammann.
Given the ""relatively modest amount of capital"" the company is deploying and the amount of carbon that will be kept out of the atmosphere, ""I think that has a very high payback, not just from a financial point of view, but in terms of the environmental benefit,"" Ammann says.
Exxon's 10% low-carbon profit hurdle, experts say, should be achievable for a fertilizer project like this (decarbonizing steel and coal will be less profitable).
And this is just the start. With over a dozen partners, Exxon has ambitions to capture and store 50 million metric tons of carbon from industrial companies along the Gulf Coast near Houston by 2030.
McDermott, the Morgan Stanley analyst, thinks Exxon stock is worth buying primarily for its oil-and-gas potential, which remains strong because of projects in the U.S. and overseas that the company started in recent years. But he thinks the low-carbon work will also pay off, and that Exxon will get more aggressive, raising its capital investments to $22.4 billion by 2027 from the current target of $15 billion.
The new law ""opens up a broader set of opportunities in the low-carbon market,"" he says. He also thinks the company can earn returns closer to 15%, and generate low-carbon earnings of $4.1 billion by 2030 and $8.2 billion by 2035. He sees the stock climbing to $113 over the next year from a recent $104.
Asked why Exxon isn't investing as much as BP, given the prospects for renewables, Ammann says that more substantial investments are on their way. ""You should measure the progress on the projects and the results from those projects. We have a very large backlog of projects that we're working on, and you'll see more to come from us.""
Consumers may never associate Big Oil with a green world. But if renewables bring real profits, the companies' dirty baggage will weigh less heavily on their stocks.

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Oct. 18 -- Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday that it left Russia completely after President Vladimir Putin expropriated its properties following seven months of discussions over an orderly transfer of its 30% stake in a major oil project, Reuters reports.Exxon did not say if it received any compensation for the assets, which it had valued at more than $4 billion. An Exxon spokesperson declined to comment on whether it will proceed to contest the seizure through an international arbitration process, a possibility flagged in August.Its departure illustrates the clash between the West and Russia over energy following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in late February and threats of using nuclear weapons against the country and its supporters. BP, TotalEnergies, Equinor, and Shell have all transferred properties to Russian partners or left operations behind.""We made every effort to engage with the Russian government and other stakeholders,"" the Exxon spokesperson said.The company said it ""safely exited"" Russia after the government earlier this month ""unilaterally terminated"" its interests in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, its largest in the country.Exxon has been trying to relinquish operation of Sakhalin-1 since March 1, when it announced it would abandon all of its more than $4 billion in assets, leaving open the possibility to sell Sakhalin-1. It said it would ""closely coordinate"" the transfer of operation with its partners - Russian company Rosneft, India's ONGC Videsh and Japan's SODECO to ensure it would be done in a secure way.In April, Exxon disclosed a $3.4 billion write down on the Russia exit and this month signalled a third-quarter $600 million impairment charge for unidentified assets. Exxon had valued its Russia holdings at more than $4 billion.On Oct 7 Putin seized Exxon shares in the oil production joint venture and transferred them to a government-controlled company. In August, Putin had signed a first decree that Exxon said made a secure and environmentally safe exit from Sakhalin-1 difficult. The US producer reacted to August's decree by issuing a ""note of difference,"" a legal step before arbitration.The harsh language of Exxon's formal exit shows a desired outcome for Exxon - leaving Russia - but in unamicable terms that could translate in multi-year legal disputes, starting with arbitration in European courts.PHASING OUTExxon has been reducing its presence in Russia since 2014, following sanctions against Moscow after it annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US company had removed earlier this year its expatriate workers and closed its lubricant and chemical businesses in Russia. By July, output at the Sakhalin-1 project fell 10,000 barrels per day (bpd), from 220,000 bpd before Russia invaded Ukraine.The volume was just enough to provide natural gas to keep the lights on in the Russian cites of Khabarovsk and Vladivostok. About 700 Russia-based employees that kept operations running will be transferred to the new Russia company taking over the asset, Exxon said.""We are thankful for the professionalism, expertise and commitment demonstrated by ENL's employees during these difficult circumstances,"" the Exxon spokesperson said.Exxon had pledged to take its time and provide for a safe transfer to a new operator to avoid spills, environmental accidents or shutting down the lights of cities supplied by the project.Russian terms blocked it from transferring operations or negotiating a potential sale to Indian or Japanese partners, which indicated interest in keeping Sakhalin-1's supply.India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp plans to take a stake in the new Russian entity that will manage the Sakhalin-1 project as it seeks to retain a 20% share in the asset, three sources familiar with the matter said.Japan will decide what to do about the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia's Far East in consultation with its partners as it reviews details of a decree by Moscow, Industry minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said last week.According to Putin's Oct 7 decree, Sakhalin-1's foreign partners will have one month after the new Russian company is created to ask the Russian government for shares in the new entity.Equinor last month agreed to sell Russian assets value at $1 billion for 1 euro. The formal sale allowed Norway's Equinor to forgo future liabilities and investment commitments. On Friday, Danone also sold its assets but kept a minority stake.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

A potential threat to a large Norwegian natural gas plant sent jitters through European energy markets Thursday, as the continent frets about suspected Russian interference in its infrastructure.
Police in Norway said early Thursday they were responding to an incident at the Nyhamna plant, a key supplier of gas to Europe from the Ormen Lange field. The Møre og Romsdal force then said on Twitter that the situation had been resolved.
""It was a threat made by telephone,"" Odd Joergen Nilssen, the mayor of Aukra municipality, where the plant is located, told Reuters.
European benchmark Dutch TTF natural gas futures on ICE jumped 2.17% Thursday to just over 160 euros ($156) per megawatt hour in the wake of the police alert.
The Nyhamna plant on Norway's west coast supplies the UK with around 20% of its natural gas and supplies up to 22 milion homes in Europe, according to Shell. It processes natural gas from two large offshore gas fields operated by European energy majors Shell and Equinor.
The Norwegian Home Guard has been patrolling the facility since last month after explosions on the Nord Stream 1 pipelines sparked fears of Russian interference in Europe's energy infrastructure.
Europe is on high alert for disruption, after Russia's cuts to gas deliveries to the region put a squeeze on supply ahead of high winter demand. Some countries believe damage to the key Nord Stream pipelines were caused by deliberate sabotage, with some pointing the finger at Moscow.
Norway's Gassco, which runs the Nyhamna plant, said gas there was flowing as planned, per Reuters.
Shell, Gassco and Equinor did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment."

De Beers has appointed Al Cook to the top job as one of the world's largest diamond producers, hiring externally from the oil and gas industry to replace Bruce Cleaver after his seven years at the helm.
Cook, whose 25 years in the energy industry most recently included heading Norwegian oil major Equinor's exploration and production business, will join as chief executive early next year, the diamond group said yesterday.
Cleaver will become co-chair after navigating a tricky period for the diamond industry in which he focused on introducing technology to prove the provenance of De Beers' stones and revamping its sales agreements.
Duncan Wanblad, chief executive of De Beers' owner Anglo American, said Cleaver had ""successfully steered De Beers through a period of considerable change"".
Cook will become the third chief executive of De Beers since 2012 when Anglo bought the Oppenheimers' stake, bringing an end to 80 years of control under the South African billionaire family. Before joining Equinor, Cook spent 20 years at BP.
The handover comes after a difficult period for De Beers, whose share of Anglo's earnings has shrunk to 5 per cent from 23 per cent in 2016, according to Berenberg, with diamond prices declining on weaker demand in China and oversupply for polishers and cutters.
""De Beers has underperformed from a return on capital standpoint for many years after being one of the pillars that kept Anglo American supported in a really terrible time around 2015,"" said Richard Hatch, analyst at Berenberg.
The diamond market is under pressure as China continues to pursue its ""zero-Covid"" policy and inflation squeezes consumer spending in the west. But uncertainty over Russian gemstone supply has boosted demand for De Beers' diamonds in recent months, helping earnings before tax and interest almost double to $718mn in the first half of the year.
Analysts and investors said Cook would bring an ability to manage relations with governments in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia, where De Beers operated, but noted that he lacked a background in luxury consumer goods.

Britain could end up locked in to expensive long-term energy deals under proposed arrangements to secure gas from countries including Norway and Qatar, Treasury officials have warned privately.
Senior government figures told the Financial Times the UK would have to pay a ""security premium"" to foreign states in return for boosting the country's energy security, alongside other measures to raise domestic production.
Liz Truss, prime minister, confirmed on Tuesday the government was seeking gas imports from various countries amid a global price surge caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and cuts to supplies to Europe.
Truss last month authorised an unprecedented £150bn intervention to cap the cost of power for households and businesses to prevent a catastrophic winter as prices soared.
About half of the gas used in the UK comes from abroad, with Norway accounting for two-thirds of imports last year. Long-term gas supply contracts can typically run from 10 to 25 years, meaning the UK could end up paying elevated prices for years to come — even if the wholesale price were to drop in the future.
Such deals are likely to be cheaper than supplies today but higher than the average price over the past decade.
While Kwasi Kwarteng, chancellor, supports the drive to establish longterm supplies, some Treasury officials have warned that it could prove expensive, given market volatility. The current price of gas in the UK is about seven times the level it averaged last decade.
Asked by Sky News if she wanted to lock the country into expensive multiyear deals, Truss replied that it was important to maintain energy security.
""We are looking at long-term energy contracts with other countries because, as well as making sure we've got a good price, energy security is vitally important,"" she said. ""And we never want to be in a position again where we're dependent on authoritarian regimes for our energy. That's why we're in the situation we are now.""
The business department previously announced a new ""energy supply task force"" had begun negotiations with gas suppliers to agree long-term contracts.
The task force is being run by Maddy McTernan, a civil servant who ran a similar operation for Britain's Covid-19 vaccine push. The UK opened negotiations with Qatar for the Gulf state to become ""supplier of last resort"" in November 2021. The world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, Qatar prefers locking clients into long-running fixed contracts and sells most of its gas to state-affiliated companies in Asia.
Negotiations with western buyers are complicated as most energy companies are in the private sector, making it more challenging to secure long-term deals.
Meanwhile the government is also in detailed negotiations with Equinor, the Norwegian state-owned energy company. Truss insisted the UK would seek ""value for money"" in the talks.
""What's happened in the past is we've ended up being dependent on the global spot price. We've seen the effect of that ... and I never want Britain to be in that position again,"" she told Sky.
Long-term deals can insulate countries to a degree from swings in the international spot price of gas and can provide greater security of supply as they cannot be bid away by other buyers. The UK faces increased competition for Norwegian gas this winter with only a portion of supplies fixed under longterm deals. Companies in Germany, Poland and France are also trying to secure additional supplies.
In June, British Gas owner Centrica signed an additional long-term supply deal with Equinor.

Vladimir Putin has few friends outside Russia. He should therefore offer a hearty bolshoe spasibo to his oilproducing brethren in Opec+. They have heeded his suggestion for sharp production cuts. Tomorrow's Vienna meeting should include a higher than expected 1mn barrel per day reduction to support sagging benchmark prices.
Brent bounced 4 per cent yesterday to more than $88 per barrel. But it has fallen by more than a quarter since peaking in early June. Opec+ says it is worried about oil market fundamentals. Russia has more to fret over. Its oil is under sanctions in the west. Indian and Chinese buyers are sopping up Russian output only because benchmark Urals crude trades so cheaply, at about $75 per barrel, according to S&P Platts. That discount did not exist before the Ukraine invasion. For Russia, both price and volumes have fallen year on year.
Production has dropped by 200,000 barrels daily compared with September last year, to about 10.5mn per day, according to Energy Aspects. Russia supplied the world with roughly a tenth of its oil before invading Ukraine.
Unusually, Opec+ is now willing to cede market share to producers outside its cartel. That shows that Opec+ is wary of the world economy. In the US, the world's largest producer and consumer, petrol demand (43 per cent of the total) has slowed. On a monthly average, it is down more than 6 per cent year on year, according to Citi data.
North Sea producers such as Equinor of Norway should benefit as Opec+ pulls back. Equinor's giant 2.7bn barrel offshore oilfield Johan Sverdrup is ramping up output. US and Canadian drillers, most without Opec country exposure, should gain market share too.
Saudi Arabia may end up sacrificing the most within Opec+ to maintain group harmony. But the real test of the cartel's consensus has yet to happen. If the oil price downtrend continues, Opec+ will need more cuts in 2023. Stresses within the group would then become intense."

| Jump to first hitLess than a year ago, offshore wind was not permitted in Australia. Unshackled and now favoured by the new Labor government, the industry is riding high and competition among multinationals is intense.
Australia's wind resource is deemed to be on a par with the world's best. Importantly, much of it is in the south, close to demand centres and to connections into the grid in regions such as the Latrobe Valley, where coal stations will retire in coming years, leaving valuable underutilised transmission infrastructure and thousands of workers out of a job.
But unlike in Europe — the world leader in offshore wind generation and where the industry has grown so rapidly that in 2020 it provided 13 per cent of the energy needs — it had remained untapped.
New legislation allowing offshore wind was eventually passed in December, but the election of the new Labor government and a policy by the Victorian state government has fired the start-gun on the sector.
Victoria is targeting two gigawatts of offshore wind by 2032, starting with the Star of the South venture, which is set to create 2000 direct jobs, power 1.2 million homes and cost between $8 billion and $10 billion. The target then doubles to 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040. In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore wind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.
The target has lured a plethora of some of the largest renewable energy companies in the world, including Shell, EDP Renewables and ENGIE, which are developing plans to invest billions to build their own offshore wind projects.
""We are excited about the potential in Australia. We see energy demand, we see a highly skilled workforce and ports,"" Thomas Hansen, business development director at the Norwegian-based Equinor, one of the world's largest energy companies, told The Australian Financial Review.
Equinor last month announced plans to develop two offshore wind projects in Australia with local company OceanEx.
For now, Gippsland — a rural region in Victoria and once a powerhouse of coal production in Australia — is the epicentre of Australia's offshore wind industry, with the federal energy minister in August moving to permit new developments in the region.
The first such development, Star of the South, is a project backed by Danish powerhouse Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and super fund Cbus. It is scheduled to come online in 2028. While some years off, these projects are huge in scale and required investment. Turbines, which can be 350 metres high, are in hot demand globally, and specialist installation vessels required to lift the wind turbine components into place are in short supply.
Australia still has to finalise offshore wind industry rules, while the details of offtake agreements, which will see the Victorian state government acquire a substantial portion of the output from offshore wind facilities, still haven't been revealed.
For Victoria to meet its ambitious target, it is therefore imperative that Star of the South will need to meet its timetable, but its chief executive officer Charles Rattray said the project can forge a path for others.
""Star of the South can play an important role. We are forging ahead and testing a lot of things that new investors will test so governments and investors will learn a lot by the progress we have made. We are doing things for the first time,"" Rattray told The Australian Financial Review.
Despite work remaining, Victoria is particularly attractive. Around Victoria's coastline, the strength and consistency of winds are high by international standards, while a large area of shallow ocean less than 50 metres to 60 metres deep is suitable for wind turbine platforms to be fixed to the seabed, a much more mature and lower cost technology than floating turbines.
Offshore wind in the region also has the added benefit of connecting into existing transmission lines from returning coal power stations, negating the need to spend billions of dollars on infrastructure.
Australia's energy market operator expects nearly two-thirds of Australia's current coal generation capacity to be gone by 2030, with the last such plants to close by 2043.
The Star of the South project plans to connect to land at Latrobe Valley, the site of two of Australia's largest coal power stations. The Hazelwood Power Station was decommissioned in 2017, while the Loy Yang coal power plant is scheduled to shut down between 2040 and 2045.
The demise of coal has decimated some local communities, but the rise of offshore wind offers new jobs.
""As Yallourn [power station] retires offshore wind is coming to life in Gippsland,"" EnergyAustralia chief executive officer Mark Collette told the Australian Financial Review.
""What we'll seek to do is to work out pathways [for those with] great skills in the electricity industry from Yallourn and take those skills and move to the offshore wind industry.""AFR

| Jump to first hitLeaders from Poland, Norway and Denmark have attended a ceremony to mark the opening of the new Baltic Pipe, a key stage in the drive to wean Poland and Europe off Russian gas.The pipeline will transport natural gas from the Norwegian shelf via Denmark and through the Baltic Sea to Poland. It is the centrepiece of a Polish strategy to diversify away from Russia that began years before Moscow's February invasion of Ukraine triggered a global energy crisis.The flows from Norway along with supplies via liquefied gas terminals are central to Poland's plan. The country was cut off from Russian gas supplies in April, allegedly for refusing to pay in roubles.""The era of Russian domination in the field of gas is coming to an end, the era that was marked by blackmail, threats and extortion,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said at the inauguration at Budno in western Poland.Norwegian Energy Minister Terje Aasland said it was ""an important step on the important road to Europe's independence from Russian energy"".""We must do everything we can to eliminate energy as an instrument of Russian power,"" added Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. ""Together we will defeat Putin."" The inauguration came after Danish and Swedish authorities identified several gas leaks on the Russian-operated Nord Stream pipelines, prompting fears of sabotage.The Danish system operator Energinet said at the weekend that the Baltic Pipe link could be commissioned at full capacity a month early thanks to good progress on work in Denmark. It brings the planned date forward to the end of November instead of 1 January.Construction in Denmark had been suspended for nine months for environmental reasons but resumed last March.""Due to an extraordinary effort on the part of everyone involved, we were able to lay the remaining pipelines faster than expected. Full commissioning can therefore take place ahead of time,"" said Torben Brabo, Energinet's Director of International Relations.""Baltic Pipe is part of a larger Polish strategy to end dependency on Russian gas flowing through the Yamal pipeline. It was a cornerstone of the plan. The fact that it is being finalised earlier than expected of course comes at a good time, since Poland no longer receives the gas it used to,"" Trine Villumsen Berling, senior researcher in global security at the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS), told Euronews.""It was, however, always the Polish plan to stop using Russian gas when the contract with Gazprom ran out by the end of 2022,"" she added.The Polish energy infrastructure minister Mateusz Berger said on Saturday that the completion meant Poland should get double the amount of gas originally expected in the last quarter of the year.Norway's Equinor said on Friday it had entered into a 10-year agreement to sell natural gas to Poland's PGNiG in a deal covering a volume of 2.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, or around 15% of Polish annual consumption. The Baltic Pipe has an annual capacity of 10 bcm.The contract with Equinor supplements Poland's liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply, domestic output and potential imports via interconnectors with its neighbours ahead of the coming winter. PGNiG said in a statement last week that it had secured its gas supply for the winter heating season.In late August a gas interconnector between Poland and Slovakia came into operation - a key part of the North-South gas infrastructure corridor between the Baltic Sea, the Adriatic and Aegean Seas, the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.""This interconnector will significantly improve the EU's security of supply and resilience of our energy system,"" said European Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson. The EU funded more than 100 million, or about 40% of the project costs.Analysts say the new Baltic Pipe should have benefits for countries beyond Poland.""The Baltic Pipe will also be important for the Baltic States. They can receive gas through the GIPL - Gas Interconnector Poland Lithuania - the same way Poland has received gas from Lithuania since April,"" said Trine Villumsen Berling.""The corridor is also suitable to transfer gas from Poland to the Danish market, further adding to the flexibility and security of energy supply in the region,"" the DIIS said an energy assessment published in July.It highlighted Poland and Lithuania as having been in the forefront of calls for ""greater unity within the EU and stronger sanctions on Russian fossil fuels"".""Although a number of strategic projects in the Polish and Lithuanian energy sectors are coming to fruition today, they are the outcomes of the two states' long-term strategic visions of energy independence from Moscow's grip,"" the report said.Source: Euronews"

Equinor will be providing nearly two million US homes with electricity generated by offshore wind, making it the largest offshore wind power developer in New York.'Norway and New York share ambitions for renewable energy and green growth. The Norwegian business sector can deliver technology and solutions that promote the global energy transition and will help us to achieve the ambitious climate targets in New York and the US,' said Mr Støre.The energy crisis has been exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the disruption of Russian gas deliveries. This is a grave situation that underlines the urgent need to accelerate the transition to renewable energy.'We are faced with challenges that are formidable and seem almost impossible to resolve. We must cut emissions more rapidly and develop a new, global energy system within a few decades. At the same time, we will be navigating the challenging years ahead as Europe moves away from its reliance on Russian gas,' said Mr Støre.Norwegian companies have world-leading expertise and extensive experience when it comes to offshore installations and hydrogen and petroleum technology, and thus have a unique competitive advantage in developing offshore wind power.Equinor is one of the Norwegian companies investing heavily in the US renewables initiative, with a wind power project off the coast of New York. The project is being developed in cooperation with local and international partners and will power nearly two million US homes.New York State has set a target of 70 % of its energy consumption to be supplied by renewable energy by 2030. A significant portion of this will be generated by offshore wind.

R enewable power has long struggled to shake off an image of idealism in the hard-nosed energy world. But the energy crisis has presented an opportunity to change perceptions: clean energy is not only about reducing pollution or hitting net zero emissions targets; it is also about making countries more secure.
Today, the price of gas is trading at roughly 10 times the level it averaged over the previous decade, after Russia cut supplies to Europe in retaliation for western sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. Electricity prices, often linked to the price of gas, have also soared. And that has pushed energy security to the top of the political agenda.
Governments are now pumping hundreds of billions of pounds and euros into schemes to support households and businesses through this winter and the next. However, sections of the energy industry are calling for a longer-term solution. For renewable energy companies — and nuclear providers, too — this is a chance to demonstrate that they can be integral to an energy security policy.
Equinor, Norway's state-backed energy company and a pioneer in technologies such as floating offshore wind and hydrogen, has been tailoring its pitch to governments in light of the crisis. As well as being a friendly and reliable oil and gas supplier, it offers wind turbines that can provide countries with a supply source less exposed to international oil and gas prices.
""Over time, more energy will be needed and that energy needs to be more and more decarbonised but it also needs to be secure,"" says Anders Opedal, Equinor chief executive. ""These days, we need to balance oil and gas production with a move towards more decarbonised energy, which is good for Europe's energy security.""
Nuclear operators have also been quick to talk up their energy security credentials. Many industry experts expect a renaissance for a sector that fell out of favour in many western countries in recent decades, particularly after the Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011.
Patrick Fragman, chief executive of Westinghouse, which is planning to build new reactors in the UK as well as in eastern Europe, argues that interest was already rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, due to decarbonisation plans. Now, energy security is very much back on the agenda.
""Geopolitics has been driving energy markets for decades,"" Fragman says. ""It had been forgotten a little while, but now it's made a huge comeback. That drives considerations of energy security and long-term planning. We have a situation where the western world has realised it has fragile market structures. Nuclear is an inconvenient truth to meet these challenges of energy security and net zero targets.""
The EU has already started to take big steps. Under its so-called REPowerEU plan, the European Commission says it aims to ""drastically accelerate our clean energy transition"" and be ""independent from Russian fossil fuels well before 2030"".
While Europe is initially replacing Russian gas with cargoes of seaborne liquefied natural gas from countries including the US and Qatar, the longerterm part of the project focuses on cutting reliance on imported fossil fuels.
Continued on page 2
Continued from page 1
Under the plan, the EU wants to have 17.5 gigawatts of hydrogen capacity within three years and has increased the renewables target to 45 per cent of power generation capacity by 2030, from a level of 40 per cent previously. That would add more than 200GW in additional capacity compared with previous proposals.
Henning Gloystein at Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy, says renewables companies are keen to emphasise their role in energy security, particularly as they — like fossil fuel groups — have been targeted with windfall taxes.
Many are earning larger profits than usual as electricity prices have soared, but they are aiming to focus attention on getting commitments to speed up new developments and cut red tape.
""The message is 'our profits will enable us to help you solve what is clearly a fossil fuel crisis',"" says Gloystein. ""They're already pushing this idea across Europe saying that they are the long-term solution, not just to hitting net zero targets but making countries more secure. But they need to be able to invest — and invest quickly.""
Others are more sceptical that cleaner forms of energy will be able to completely isolate countries from geopolitical risks.
There are already concerns about the dominance of solar markets by China. It is responsible for more than 80 per cent of the manufacturing chains for items such as cells and polysilicon and, with it having driven down costs, other countries struggle to compete.
China also dominates the market for many rare earth metals used in magnets that are critical for the construction of wind turbines and electric car motors.
In the nuclear sector, Russia is one of the biggest suppliers of enriched uranium, the key fuel used in plants, controlling more than 40 per cent of the global market, according to researchers at Berenberg.
Supporters of clean energy feel these challenges risk being overstated, however, when compared with the all-toocurrent threat posed by gas and other fossil fuel prices.
""It's not going to be a short-term fix as it's going to take quite a few years to build those plants,"" Fragman says.
""But, done in the right way, we can have electricity that is affordable and reliable.""'The western world has realised it has fragile market structures' 'Done in the right way, we can have electricity that is affordable and reliable'

| Jump to first hitRosneft paid just 1 euro ($1) for Equinor's main assets when the Norwegian oil major left Russia, per Reuters. Western oil majors have been trying to exit Russia given the sanctions its faces over the Ukraine war. The Kremlin allowed Equinor to drop $1 billion worth of its investment commitments as part of the deal.
Russia's state-run energy giant Rosneft paid the equivalent of $1 for Equinor's main assets when the Norwegian oil major left its operations in the country earlier this month, Reuters reported.
In sealing the deal that allowed it to fully exit Russia, Equinor dodged a long-drawn-out faceoff with Moscow, but at a cost.
After weeks of negotiations, the Kremlin agreed to allow Equinor to drop $1 billion worth of future investment liabilities and commitments, Reuters reported Wednesday, citing three industry sources.
They will be transferred to Rosneft as part of the deal, which called for the Norwegian company to sell its stake in its joint ventures with its Russian counterpart for just 1 euro ($1) in return.
It means Equinor is walking away from a deal it signed a decade ago to help Rosneft search for oil and gas across north, eastern, and southern Russia.
The Norwegian energy giant said earlier in September it had fully exited its four joint ventures with Rosneft at the start of the month, becoming the first western oil major to have no remaining assets or projects in Russia.
Russian leader Vladimir Putin signed a presidential decree in August that prevents foreign investors from selling their stakes in oil, gas and banking projects without the Kremlin's approval. That has disrupted other energy giants' attempts to find buyers for their Russian businesses.
British firms BP and Shell are yet to sell or forgo their investments in Russia. Meanwhile, the US's ExxonMobil is weighing up legal action to contest Putin's decree, which it says has blocked its attempts to exit the country.
All three companies said they intended to leave Russia after Putin invaded Ukraine in late February, and each estimate that abandoning their Russian operations would lead to losses amounting to tens of billions of dollars.

Extraction hopes Industry urges reform of planning and earthquake regulations after ban ends,https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/frackers-seek-rule-changes-kick-start-projects/docview/2723642014/se-2?accountid=7064,EQNR,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

Fracking companies have said that Liz Truss's lifting of a moratorium on the controversial method of shale gas extraction will not resurrect the industry in England without rapid reform of planning and earthquake rules.
The new prime minister on Thursday ended a ban on fracking in England that has been in place since 2019, as part of wide-ranging reforms to bolster Britain's domestic energy supplies and address soaring bills for households and businesses.
Truss claimed the decision ""could get gas flowing in as soon as six months"", although she acknowledged that the resumption of fracking in England would also be dependent on ""where there is local support for it"".
While fracking companies including Australian-owned Cuadrilla and Britain's largest privately owned company Ineos welcomed the reversal, industry insiders warned that other rules would also need to be tackled if the government wanted to kick-start production.
Ross Glover, development director at Aim-listed fracking company IGas Energy, told the Financial Times that streamlining rules around planning and permitting would be crucial. ""Development of any form of infrastructure"" in the UK faces a lengthy planning and permitting process, Glover argued. ""We are not saying get rid of all the regulation, what we are saying is we need to have a proper discussion about how we accelerate the projects.""
IGas shares have surged more than 650 per cent this year, partly on the back of investor anticipation of a reversal of the fracking moratorium.
Shale gas companies have also long called for a review of seismicity regulations, known as the ""traffic light system"", that require an immediate halt to work if fracking triggers earth tremors of magnitude 0.5 or above.
Charles McAllister, director of policy at UKOOG, a trade body that represents frackers, warned that if the industry did ""not get the comprehensive policy support required, then some of the companies may not progress"" their shale projects. UKOOG is asking for the fracking industry to be subject to the same standards on surface vibrations that apply to other industries.
Brian Mullin, head of planning con- sultancy Marrons Planning, suggested community consent may also need to be removed from fracking consenting processes ""as it demonstrably amounts to a moratorium for delivery"".
Ineos, which has offered to drill a shale gas test well to prove to the government that ""we can do [fracking] safely and without harm to the environment"", has raised the prospect of payments to local communities to gain support. ""We have promised to invest the first 6 per cent of the value of the gas back into the local communities,"" Ineos director Tom Crotty said on Thursday.
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, involves pumping water, sand and chemicals under the ground at high pressure to release gas from rock formations. It has transformed the US energy sector but some leading academics have long argued Britain's geology is ill-suited to the process, even if community consent in such a densely populated country could be achieved.
""[The] geological history of the UK is complicated,"" said Stuart Haszeldine, professor at school of geosciences at the University of Edinburgh.
Truss's energy reforms are also aimed at unleashing a new wave of exploration among UK North Sea companies, although sceptics argue that any increase in the region's output is likely to have a minimal impact on sky-high oil and gas prices.
Truss will give the green light to the first oil and gas licensing round since 2019-20 as the government seeks to arrest falls in UK oil and gas production.
The UK's annual North Sea oil and gas output dropped 17 per cent last year. Although gas production has improved 27 per cent year on year in the first half of 2022, energy companies have cautioned that the reversal will prove ""shortlived"" unless there is a new wave of investment.
The new permits will be for mature areas of the UK North Sea, meaning any companies that successfully drill new wells can take advantage of existing infrastructure rather than installing costly new pipelines.
The UK oil and gas regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority, will prioritise an initial package of fast-track licences that contain existing discoveries, which companies could potentially exploit in less than a year, although the remaining permits could take between five and 10 years to yield any production. Officials are also seeking to accelerate projects that are already in the development stages so they can reach production faster.
The government is particularly keen for Equinor to progress its Rosebank oil and gas field 130km off the coast of the Shetland Islands, say people familiar with officials' thinking. Rosebank is among the largest in a pipeline of projects set to receive approval in 2022 and 2023. Another of the biggest, Shell's Jackdaw gas scheme, was approved in June. Equinor has so far said it will take a final investment decision on Rosebank in 2023.
Yvonne Telford, senior analyst for north-west Europe at the consultancy Westwood Global Energy Group, said exploration and production companies did have the ""appetite"" to proceed with developments. But she warned that ""production volumes from the larger developments such as Shell's Jackdaw and Equinor's Rosebank fields will not be seen until 2026 and 2027"".Energy groups caution that the reversal will prove 'shortlived' unless there is a new wave of investment

Norway is open to discussing potential long-term gas agreements and price caps with European partners to help alleviate the energy crisis, its prime minister has said.
The Scandinavian country, which is not in the EU, has become one of the biggest winners of the fallout from Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, replacing Russia as Europe's biggest supplier of gas and as a significant seller of oil and electricity across the continent.
""I fully understand that Europe now has a profound debate about how energy markets work, how they can secure more affordable prices for citizens, families, industries, how this shortfall of gas after [Russian president Vladimir] Putin's aggression can be handled,"" said Jonas Gahr Støre, prime minister. ""Norway is not closing doors to any such discussion.""
But Støre warned the EU and member state governments had to be careful not to adopt measures that ended up jeopardising energy supplies as Europe prepared for a tough winter.
Some oil and gas executives outside Norway have argued that the wealthy nation should do more to help Europe ahead of a tough winter. Støre said the responsibility for any deals lay with companies such as Equinor, the state oil group. Equinor and other companies are in discussion with customers about potential long-term contracts that could lock in a gas price lower than the present level but higher than that of a year ago, said people familiar with the talks.
Asked whether Norway could agree to a voluntary price cap, Støre said: ""I am not closing the door to any ideas that can take Europe forward. It is in Norway's profound interest that we reduce instability, that we increase reliability for our allies and partners.""
He said Norway had increased gas supplies to Europe by 10 per cent this year and it wanted to be recognised as a ""predictable and long-term"" partner. Additional reporting by David Sheppard and Tom Wilson in London

Higher taxation of energy companies is justified if it gives governments the means to ease costs for consumers and other businesses, Equinor's chief executive has said, in a rare message of support from a corporate leader for higher levies.
The Norwegian state-controlled group, the largest supplier of piped gas to Europe after Russia, has been among the biggest beneficiaries of Moscow's decision to choke supply to the continent, which has sent prices rising to records. Pre-tax earnings hit $17.6bn in the second quarter, triple the level of a year earlier.
""We are fully aware that there are people on the other side of the gas bill,"" Anders Opedal said. ""Of course we would like a very stable framework around our business, but we do see the need for government to intervene.""
European gas prices hit a record €343 per megawatt hour in August and are trading at about €240 per megawatt hour, more than 20 times higher than two years ago. The rally has supercharged profits for European gas producers, leading to calls on companies such as Equinor, BP and Shell to help ease the cost for customers.
But Opedal argued that governments were better placed than oil and gas companies to support businesses and households through the energy crisis.
""It is much better that government distribute wealth than commercial companies start to do something on their own, which would not be evenly distributed and might not hit the right group of people,"" he said.
Opedal's message of support for higher taxes comes as Brussels weighs measures to tackle the widening crisis, including possible blocwide levies on fossil fuel producers and electricity generators. The UK imposed an ""energy profits levy"" on oil and gas producers in the North Sea in May.
Equinor pays a marginal tax rate of 78 per cent in Norway, where it generates the majority of its earnings and which is not a member of the EU. It is possible that Equinor's tax rate will not rise.
Opedal said he viewed Equinor's principal responsibility to be increasing the flow of gas into Europe to ease the supply crunch. Between April and June it increased gas output 18 per cent against the same period a year earlier.

Holgersen in Hanoi.At the meeting, Holgersen introduced capabilities, experience, and how Equinor transformed from a state-owned oil and gas group into an energy group. She held that PetroVietnam and Equinor share many similarities, including the same starting point as oil and gas companies. She hailed PetroVietnam's role and position as the leading energy enterprise in Vietnam, as well as the leading capable and experienced firm in Southeast Asia in the field of processing, manufacturing, assembling, transportation and construction of offshore construction works.Holgersen expressed her hope that the partnership between Equinor and PetroVietnam will further grow with more practical results in building and implementing investment cooperation in the field of energy, offshore wind power development, production of hydrogen, ammonia, Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCS/CCUS).PetroVietnam General Director Le Manh Hung highly evaluated the cooperation activities between PetroVietnam and Equinor recently in the field of offshore wind power. Hung said he hoped Equinor will expand cooperation with PetroVietnam in the field of clean energy, especially hydrogen production from offshore wind power. At the same time, he suggested that Equinor work with PetroVietnam member units such as PetroVietnam Technical Services Corporation (PTSC) and Vietsovpetro (VSP) and support them in participating in Equinor's projects not only in Vietnam but in international markets. In the coming time, the two sides should continue to work with the Government as well as relevant ministries, sectors and localities to develop a roadmap for the implementation of specific joint offshore wind power projects in Vietnam, he proposed.Meanwhile, during a recent working trip to the US, PTSC General Director Le Manh Cuong had a working session with representatives from Equinor on cooperation in the implementation of offshore wind power projects.At the session, both sides undated each other on the progress, infrastructure investment and logistics for two giant offshore wind power projects of Empire Wind an Becon Wind in the US.Hung introduced PTSC's capacity, experience and infrastructure in seaports and manufacturing yards. He underlined that in its strategic directions, PTSC plans to participate in providing base and transformer station manufacturing services, while looking for opportunities to invest in and develop offshore renewable energy projects in Vietnam.Showing impression for the capacity, experience and infrastructure of PTSC, Equinor representatives held that PTSC is a competent supplier of services for offshore renewable energy projects and a suitable local partner for investors in offshore wind power development in Vietnam.Founded in 1972 as the Norwegian State's Oil & Gas Company (Statoil), Equinor has become an international company with operations in 33 countries and now is a leading company in the energy transition. It is the largest oil and gas operator in Norway, one of the world's largest offshore operators, and a growing force in renewables. Equinor provides more than one million European homes with renewable power from offshore wind farms in the United Kingdom and Germany. By 2030, the firm plans to have grown its installed net renewables capacity from 2021's 0.7 GW to 12-16 GW. Two-thirds of this capacity will be within offshore wind.Since 2021, PTSC and Equinor has conducted a number of meetings to seek cooperation opportunities in offshore renewable energy, especially offshore wind power in Vietnam.In May, Equinor officially launched its representative office in Hanoi, affirming its willingness and determination to make contributions to the development of Vietnam's offshore wind power sector as well as the green transition process of Vietnam, and support Vietnam in realising its commitments in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26).Earlier in October 2021, together with the Norwegian Embassy in Hanoi, Equinor completed a Vietnam Supply Chain Study Report and handed it over to Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyen Hong Dien right before his trip to COP26 with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh. - VNA"

| Jump to first hitGlobal energy giant Equinor has partnered with Australian renewable energy company OceanEx to develop offshore wind projects in NSW, as the Norwegian company moves to capitalise on the state's proposed generation target.
Federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen has identified offshore wind projects as central to Labor's ambition to rapidly grow renewable energy generation. International companies have moved to develop offshore wind in Victoria, which will be the site of Australia's first offshore projects.
Equinor has partnered with OceanEx to position itself as the first mover in NSW. OceanEx was established by two of the founders of Star of the South, which is on course to be Australia's first commissioned offshore wind farm as Victoria aims for 20 per cent of the state's energy needs from the zero emission source by the end of the decade.
Although other renewable energy developers consider Victoria to be the most attractive offshore wind location, Thomas Hansen, business development director at Equinor, said NSW had several advantages over Gippsland.
""We see energy demand, we see a highly skilled workforce, infrastructure, ports and then of course, the water depths and the [network)] layout in Australia/NSW means that floating technology where we have a solid track record is very well suited,"" Mr Hansen told The Australian Financial Review.
Equinor and OceanEx will begin work on three offshore wind projects in NSW, each with a proposed generation capacity of 2 gigawatts. The duo hope to work on the projects simultaneously but this will depend on the regulatory developments.
Mr Bowen has proposed offshore wind projects be permitted in the Hunter and Illawarra, both sites Equinor and OceanEx hope to develop in, but public consultations must occur before developers can seek a feasibility licence. The two companies said the regulatory environment made it hard to put a timetable on the development of the offshore projects in NSW.
OceanEx said it was targeting first generation in NSW by the end of the decade.
The rush for offshore wind generation comes as Australia's ageing coal infrastructure increasingly suffers from unscheduled outages or retirements, exacerbating pressure to find alternative energy sources.
Australia's energy market operator expects almost two-thirds of Australia's coal generation capacity to be gone by 2030, with the last such plants to close by 2043.
Offshore wind is a key pillar of the government's plan to move aggressively to meet its target of having zero-emission sources make up more than 80 per cent of Australia's electricity mix by 2030. This is a key element of Australia's plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
A supply bottleneck is also adding to concerns about Australia's ability to meet its target, and OceanEx chief executive Andy Evans said declaring both Hunter and Illawarra as open to offshore wind would ease logjams.
""We want to hit both up contemporaneously,"" Mr Evans said. ""It's much easier for us to be working supply chain, saying, 'You're coming here and building multiple projects simultaneously rather than staggering each one'; and even little things like getting vessels here. It's easier to get vessels and park them for five years for two projects, rather than having one for three then sending it back and trying to get it back again.""
Although Equinor is the first international giant to move into NSW, it will not be the last. NSW is mulling an offshore wind target in a bid to incentivise the development of the sector. Analysts have warned that the state risks further price rises and threats to supply without a massive acceleration of renewable energy projects.

| Jump to first hitFossil fuel companies' net zero plans won't meet vital Paris Agreement climate goals, according to a damning new study.The world will warm significantly more than 1.5°C unless oil polluters radically overhaul their emissions reduction goals.Researchers from Climate Analytics Germany analysed the 'decarbonisation' pathways of energy giants BP, Shell and Equinor.All of the pathways showed delayed reductions in fossil fuel consumption, the researchers wrote - making them incompatible with the global plan to keep emissions below 1.5°C. Fossil fuel companies claim that we can continue to burn oil and gas while keeping to the 1.5°C warming limit, and they cite their own scenarios as justification, says Bill Hare, CEO and Senior Scientist at Climate Analytics.But our research shows that their pathways would bust the Paris Agreement. Even temporarily exceeding the 1.5°C warming would lead to catastrophic impacts and severely weaken our ability to adapt to climate change.What is the Paris climate agreement and why is it important?Under the 2016 Paris Agreement, countries pledged to keep the global temperature well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels - and as close to 1.5°C as possible.The stakes of meeting these targets are high.The planet is already 1.1°C warmer than it was 150 years ago - and extreme weather events are growing more common every year.Last month was the third warmest July on record, with many countries suffering from wildfires and drought.As Europe and the UK sweltered under record-breaking temperatures last month, WMO Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas described the heatwave as the new normal.If we fail to prevent temperature rises, swathes of the world will become borderline uninhabitable.At 1.5°C warming, about 14 per cent of Earth's population will be exposed to severe heatwaves at least once every five years, while at 2°C warming that number jumps to 37 per cent.At present we are on a pathway to exceed 3°C of global warming by 2030.How much will the globe warm up under current plans?'Decarbonisation' pathways estimate how long it will take for the world to reach net zero by predicting future energy requirements.The pathways published by big energy companies offer revealing insights, as they show when they assume fossil fuel demand will dip.Researchers analysed six institutional scenarios published between 2020 and mid 2021, including four from oil majors and two developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), an intergovernmental energy policy organisation.Energy company Equinor's 'Rebalance' projection peaks at a median warming of 1.73°C above pre-industrial levels in 2060.BP's 'Rapid' plan would see the globe warmed by 1.73°C in 2058, while Shell's 'Sky' would see the earth hit 1.81°C warming in 2069.Only one scenario - the IEA Net Zero 2050 plan - keeps warming to 1.5°CMost of the scenarios we evaluated would be classified as inconsistent with the Paris Agreement as they fail to limit warming to well below 2 C... and would exceed the 1.5 C warming limit by a significant margin, says Dr Robert Brecha, co-lead author of the study.Source: Euronews"

| Jump to first hitSeveral major oil companies, including BP and Shell, periodically publish scenarios forecasting the future of the energy sector. In recent years, they have added visions for how climate change might be addressed, including scenarios that they claim are consistent with the international Paris climate agreement.
These scenarios are hugely influential. They are used by companies making investment decisions and, importantly, by policymakers as a basis for their decisions.
But are they really compatible with the Paris Agreement?
Many of the future scenarios show continued reliance on fossil fuels. But data gaps and a lack of transparency can make it difficult to compare them with independent scientific assessments, such as the global reviews by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
In a study published Aug. 16, 2022, in Nature Communications, our international team analyzed four of these scenarios and two others by the International Energy Agency using a new method we developed for comparing such energy scenarios head-to-head. We determined that five of them – including frequently cited scenarios from BP, Shell and Equinor – were not consistent with the Paris goals.
What the Paris Agreement expects
The 2015 Paris Agreement, signed by nearly all countries, sets out a few criteria to meet its objectives.
One is to ensure the global average temperature increase stays well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F) compared to pre-industrial era levels, and to pursue efforts to keep warming under 1.5°C (2.7 F). The agreement also states that global emissions should peak as soon as possible and reach at least net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the second half of the century. Pathways that meet these objectives show that carbon dioxide emissions should fall even faster, reaching net zero by about 2050.
Scientific evidence shows that overshooting 1.5°C of warming, even temporarily, would have harmful consequences for the global climate. Those consequences are not necessarily reversible, and it’s unclear how well people, ecosystems and economies would be able to adapt.
How the scenarios perform
We have been working with the nonprofit science and policy research institute Climate Analytics to better understand the implications of the Paris Agreement for global and national decarbonization pathways – the paths countries can take to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. In particular, we have explored the roles that coal and natural gas can play as the world transitions away from fossil fuels.
When we analyzed the energy companies’ decarbonization scenarios, we found that BP’s, Shell’s and Equinor’s scenarios overshoot the 1.5°C limit of the Paris Agreement by a significant margin, with only BP’s having a greater than 50% chance of subsequently drawing temperatures down to 1.5°C by 2100.
These scenarios also showed higher near-term use of coal and long-term use of gas for electricity production than Paris-compatible scenarios, such as those assessed by the IPCC. Overall, the energy company scenarios also feature higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions than Paris-compatible scenarios.
Of the six scenarios, we determined that only the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero by 2050 scenario sketches out an energy future that is compatible with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement goal.
We found this scenario has a greater than 33% chance of keeping warming from ever exceeding 1.5°C, a 50% chance of having temperatures 1.5°C warmer or less in 2100, and a nearly 90% chance of keeping warming always below 2°C. This is in line with the criteria we use to assess Paris Agreement consistency, and also in line with the approach taken in the IPCC’s Special Report on 1.5°C, which highlights pathways with no or limited overshoot to be 1.5°C compatible.
Getting the right picture of decarbonization
When any group publishes future energy scenarios, it’s useful to have a transparent way to make an apples-to-apples comparison and evaluate the temperature implications. Most of the corporate scenarios, with the exception of Shell’s Sky 1.5 scenario, don’t extend beyond midcentury and focus on carbon dioxide without assessing other greenhouse gases.
Our method uses a transparent procedure to extend each pathway to 2100 and estimate emissions of other gases, which allows us to calculate the temperature outcomes of these scenarios using simple climate models.
Without a consistent basis for comparison, there is a risk that policymakers and businesses will have an inaccurate picture about the pathways available for decarbonizing economies.
Meeting the 1.5°C goal will be challenging. The planet has already warmed about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, and people are suffering through deadly heat waves, droughts, wildfires and extreme storms linked to climate change. There is little room for false starts and dead-ends as countries transform their energy, agricultural and industrial systems on the way to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.

| Jump to first hitINDUSTRY body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) has given its backing to Equinor's plans to develop a major oil and gas field on the UK's continental shelf.
Last week, the Norwegian energy giant submitted its environmental statement for the Rosebank development to the authorities.
This has eased fears Equinor would ditch the £4.5bn project, following the introduction of the Energy Profits
Levy earlier this year.
OEUK has described the project as an ""exciting development"" that ""could set new standards"" for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""
Equinor acquired Rosebank in 2019 and has been working with partners Suncor and Ithaca Energy to develop the field, powering operations with electricity - reducing emissions.
It predicts the site, if approved, would create £8.1bn of direct investment, of which £6.3bn could go to UK-based businesses.
Rosebank contains up to 300m barrels of recoverable oil, and is one of the largest untapped discoveries in UK waters. At its peak, the Rosebank field, which lies about 81 miles northwest of Shetland, is predicted to produce 69,000 barrels of oil per day.
This would be roughly equivalent to eight per cent of the UK's entire output between 2026 and 2030.
It would also produce about 44m cubic feet of gas (1.2m cubic metres) per day in its first 10 years - enough to supply a city the size of Coventry."

| Jump to first hitDavid Armstrong, who runs the crucial procurement and supply chain side of bp’s revolutionary Net Zero Teesside Power project, tells Mike Hughes how hundreds of firms will help him piece together one of the most complex and innovative projects the region has ever seen.
The Net Zero Teesside Power plant will be one of the engineering marvels of the 21st Century, sitting next to the river at the heart of Teesworks, it will be an 860-megawatt, gas fired power station that can run up to 1.3 million homes every year.
The carbon dioxide it generates will be captured and transported approximately 145 kilometres offshore to be stored safely deep beneath the North Sea. The plant is a joint venture between bp and Equinor, with bp as operator and aims to be the world’s first commercial-scale gas-fired power station with carbon capture – right here on Teesside just a few yards from where the steel furnaces glowed with pride and graft.

Companies like bp are now leading the way in finding solutions and alternative routes to power.
For people like David Armstrong, the whole project starts with the first meeting, the first lines on paper and the first person to ask ‘what if we do it this way – could we make this work?’.
Complex matrix
David is the Senior Procurement Manager, responsible for answering that question by assembling a complex matrix of partner companies who will supply everything from handrails to gas turbines.
At a recent NOF (the not-for-profit business development organisation) event to pull together that matrix, more than 300 businesses were told about the benefits and opportunities that lie ahead before the site is up and running in the next five years, with the project potentially generating up to 4,000 jobs during its construction.
How NZT Power will work
The energy in the room and around the region was palpable. North-East businesses large and small know they deserve the scale of investment and the benefits it will bring and are proudly putting themselves forward as partners to make it happen.
Joanne Leng MBE, chief executive of NOF, said: “Net Zero Teesside Power will be a major contributor to the energy transition and our members, together with the wider supply chain are well positioned to support its development, construction and operation. The innovation, technologies and energy industry expertise available within the supply chain will be of significant benefit to this landmark project.”
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “It’s essential our local supply chain businesses know the ins and outs of everything we’re doing at Teesworks and with projects like NZT so they can grab these massive opportunities with both hands. This will help all corners of Teesside, Hartlepool and Darlington benefit from transformational work that we’re carrying out, boosting businesses and, ultimately, putting more money in people’s pockets.”
Government support
The NZT project has been strongly supported by government to date. In March 2021 Net Zero Teesside was awarded funding as part of the Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge under the UK Research and Innovation’s (UKRI) Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF).
“Net Zero Teesside has developed tremendous momentum since receiving a grant award of £28 million from UKRI’s Industrial Decarbonisation Challenge. This flagship UK decarbonisation project will deliver the world’s first flexible gas power plant with CCUS. It will also boost the competitiveness of the local economy, create and project jobs and will drive inwards investment into the region,” said Dr William Joyce, Innovation Lead at UKRI.
For David Armstrong, the work had started well before.
David Armstrong's work started at the very beginning of the project
“My role began way back when there were about five of us on the project,” he explains.
“My accountability, working with the project general manger, is to develop the contracting and execution approach for the project. What we set out here sets the tone of the project and the strategy for next five to six years.
“What funnels through me is all the third party spend with contractors and suppliers. We decide how best we spend that money - how we want contractors to come together and how we can best use the enormous variety of UK and local suppliers.
“I look after the strategy around the contracting approach we want to take on the project, so we're now in the phase where we're doing a lot of the front-end engineering, and shortly we'll be getting ready for the big EPC contracts (Engineering, Procurement, Construction) that will be executed from May 2023 onwards.”
New benchmarks
He is a polite and precise man who seems completely at ease with his task. I’m sure there are sleepless nights in there somewhere, but he clearly knows his job and is confident enough to redefine it for each project, having worked on the astonishing Khazzan natural gas project in Oman, which set new benchmarks for quality and innovation.
This was a previously undeveloped desert site 350 kilometres south of Muscat which will contribute around a third of Oman’s natural gas supply, involving 12,000 construction staff, 56 kilometres of roads, several thousand metres of power lines and a 60-kilometre water pipeline.
Within a few weeks of finishing that project, he was on his way to Teesside to start looking at NZT Power. Over the next few weeks and months, he knew it would be possible to change the way energy was generated.
“We started doing our homework very early on,” he tells me at the Hardwick Hotel where the NOF event was taking place.
“Wherever it makes logical sense to grow the business, I will come in to help and make sure we've assessed the supply chain, understand the risks, and think about how we can best execute that into the market.
'It's massively exciting and energising for us'
“Admittedly, mainland UK has not been a particular hub for major projects for bp over the last 10 to 20 years, so it’s been fantastic for a lot of the project team with 15 to 25 years of experience of working on projects in the North Sea, Mexico, Azerbaijan, or the Middle East to now be able to focus on one here. Now there are major projects in the UK, and this will be one of the big hubs going forward.
“It's massively exciting and energising for us to bring that talent, those skills and all the learnings and experience together for our work in the UK market.”

It is time well spent listening to David as he deconstructs the process of coming on-board during the early days of concept development, to working towards a completed project that will be the talk of the industry. How perfectly each section of his own Procurement pipeline meets the next is crucial not only for bp and Equinor, but for the Government’s own net zero ambitions.
“No one's ever done what we're trying to do before,” he says.
“It’s a world first and just a brilliant project to work on because there's no playbook for the contracting and execution approach that we can grab off the shelf to say, right, this is how to do it. Not only that, it's a headline project for bp and the UK Government - so no pressure! ”
Supply chain
“We wanted to engage the supply chain while recognising there's no existing strategy for this type of scope - we don't have all the answers. So we're quite humble in the way that we approach the market.
“When we brought our key players together - major engineering and construction contractors, Power providers and Carbon Capture licensors in the UK - there were over 20 of them in the mix - I envisaged it almost like a giant dance floor.
“We outlined our initial thoughts, our project drivers and what we're trying to achieve, and asked them to come together and then respond back with their ideas and solutions in quite a rigorous form over six months. We were quite convinced that this consortium approach would make a lot of sense.”
bp CEO Bernard Looney, with UK Head Louise Kingham and Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen at Teesworks
One of the unique challenges they all faced was that this breakthrough business model wouldn’t work if it was just a power station throwing out CO2 into the atmosphere. It had to capture it at the same time as it was producing electricity.
That was new. So, they needed all sides working together and learning about each other from a very early stage.
“Because of the technology firsts that we saw here, we wanted to bring them together now. To maximise something we call front-end loading – which basically means bringing them together early, to integrate their complex technology, reducing project technical and executional risk. Power and construction contractors would never normally get involved in the FEED, but they are in it now.
Two consortiums
“We ended up with four potential consortiums and last year, we conducted a tender exercise with those four, and got it down to two.
“At the end of the process one of them will be selected for the execute phase. This ensures both front end loading and early contractor engagement plus competition - to demonstrate value for money.
“On the one side we have Technip Energies and GE consortium with Shell Cansolv for the capture technology, and Balfour Beatty being the construction contractor. And then on the other side a consortium of Aker Solutions, Siemens and Doosan Babcock with Aker Carbon Capture technology.”
Those two are now competing against each other for the rest of this year, when each will give an EPC bid and one will be selected for a contract in excess of £1 billion. There are many different technology challenges and therefore each contractor group could come up with different solution designs and execution approaches, but at every step of the way they will be calling on the supply chain to work with them.
“We want to maximise the use of UK and local supply chains and as part of that, and what BEIS want as well, is transparency and early engagement in the market to make sure local contractors are aware of what's happening, how they can get involved, and how they can then get plugged in with the Tier 1 EPC contractors.”
As David says, as well as the supply chain expertise, the skills for this remarkable project are going to be needed for generations to come.
That is a challenge on such a vast scale, but one the region will thrive on as school pupils, apprentices, university and college students and graduates turn to inspiring work like this to redirect their aspirations and build their careers here in the North East.
And for bp this is an investment in the future of those young people as well as the revitalisation of the region they live in, as David and his team drill deep down into the talents and skills we have here and those that we are capable of developing, to find the right people.

T he old riverside customs and excise office in South Shields, once one of the world's most important shipbuilding hubs, boasts a mosaic that tells the port's maritime story. In the middle there is the River Tyne teeming with salmon, in the days before it was blackened by shipyards and coal.
""There was a time when they used to say 'if you fall in the Tyne you'll be poisoned before you drown',"" says Ray Spencer, executive director of the arts centre that now occupies the Customs House. Now, he says, once again ""it's the best salmon fishing river in England, the Tyne.""
The river's restoration can be seen as a symbol of what the region aspires to, after the collapse in heavy industry across the North East from the 1970s created an economic shock that still reverberates here.
Spurred on in part by a Conservative government in London that made ""levelling up"" former industrial regions its signature issue, South Shields and other towns in the North East have been busy developing their own plans for economic renewal, many of them built around clean energy. Some believe green jobs could replace what has been lost through the decline of shipbuilding.
Roughly 130km out to sea from South Shields, the world's biggest offshore wind farm is about to be built. Over the next four years, Dogger Bank is expected to create more than 1,000 jobs during construction, retaining a little shy of 400 once operational, half of them at the Port of Tyne in South Shields.
It is part of a growing green economy in the North East upon which local leaders are pinning their hopes of revival, from the planned Britishvolt gigafactory up the coast at Blyth to green hydrogen production by BP further south in Teesside, at the UK's biggest freeport.
Jonathan Tew, chief executive of South Tyneside council, the local authority covering South Shields, believes it is ""absolutely critical"" for the government's net zero ambitions, and for the region's economy, that the North East now ""becomes essentially the battery of the country, in terms of providing the energy of the future"", not least in the face of rising energy prices.
""If that happens, the potential for us really is dizzying, isn't it?"" he says. Tew can see it ""being more than what we saw through coal or through ships, in terms of future industrial opportunity"".
These ambitions hinge not just on the efforts of regional authorities but also the government in Westminster, currently gripped by political turbulence as members of the Conservative party spend the next six weeks choosing a new leader — and British prime minister — to replace Boris Johnson.
There are two important audiences for the debates now taking place between the remaining candidates, foreign secretary Liz Truss and former chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak.
The first is the 150,000 or so party members who get to vote on the next prime minister — and for whom the candidates are presenting themselves as the rightful heir of Margaret Thatcher and a legacy of tax-cutting, small-government conservatism.
But there is another audience — the voters in the former industrial towns of the Midlands and North of England who shifted to the Conservatives, first under Theresa May and then under Boris Johnson, on the back of a promise to narrow chronic regional divides.
The Tory candidates find themselves, therefore, pointing in two different directions: promising lower taxes to the party faithful but also pledging to deliver substantial economic regeneration — the agenda that has become known as levelling up.
Several influential figures have already warned against forgetting that agenda, particularly after the sacking of former levelling up secretary Michael Gove, seen by many in the regions as a focused minister who understood the economic arguments.
Research by the left-leaning thinktank IPPR North this week warned that since Johnson first uttered the phrase levelling up three years ago this week, government had in fact been doing ""business as usual"", with public spending rising fastest in London and slowest here, in the post-industrial North East.
A prime candidate for levelling up, the region routinely performs worst in terms of economic and social indicators, as the gap between the South East and other places grows. New research from the End Child Poverty coalition shows the North East is now the UK's child poverty capital, overtaking London.
""We are all very nervous about the current position we're in,"" says Tew of the existing socio-economic picture as the cost of living rises.
In South Shields, 8.3 per cent of people have no qualifications — compared with a UK average of 6.6 per cent — and only 29.5 per cent are educated to degree level, against a national average of 43.5 per cent.
When the think-tank Onward visited
South Shields to carry out research on ""levelling up in practice"", it identified ""green shoots of economic revival"" in the potential of industrial projects such as Dogger Bank. But it also identified obstacles: small businesses felt ""unsupported"", struggling to ""network and grow"". Attempts by local councils to secure funding from various government levelling up funds had largely failed; and ""visible closures of public services"" during austerity had hit public confidence, Onward said.
Adam Hawksbee, Onward's deputy director who carried out the research, says ""the future appears to be right there"", referring to green jobs. ""But there's really no link between people's perception of the area and that reality,"" he adds.
A green revival? There are already some early signs of a green energy industry developing in the North East. Energy group Equinor has built the operations base for its new Dogger Bank wind farm at Port of Tyne, just metres from Customs House.
Tom Nightingale, an Equinor executive involved in the project, says there has been no shortage of job applicants, with more than 450 people vying for just 10 initial offshore technician roles. Equinor aims to recruit at least half of its staff from the North East. ""Definitely these are places that have got quite a lot of deprivation and a lot of the industries that people are proud of just aren't actually offering that many jobs anymore,"" he says. ""So what's next?""
The Port of Tyne, one of only two deep seaports in the region, owns 17 miles of river through South Shields and was once one of the world's biggest coal exporters. It has now cleared 200 acres of prime development land for green industrial anchor tenants. It houses the only maritime innovation hub in the country, a partnership including Nissan and the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult, which researches and develops decarbonisation technology for the sector. Matt Beeton, chief executive of the Port of Tyne, believes green industrial opportunities need to be grasped quickly.
""If you look at the amount of gigawatts that are needed in this energy transition it's phenomenal, but lots of these opportunities are going elsewhere,"" he says, in particular to western Europe. ""There's a real sweet spot between 18 months and two years to land lots of this stuff.""
But while the plans for a green industrial revival have started to take shape, local officials say they have not received the sort of support from the government in London that they had hoped for — even before Johnson's resignation.
Although South Tyneside has put green energy at the heart of its latest bid for levelling up funds, previous bids to the various government programmes that are dispensing funding to councils in the Midlands and North of the country were rejected, Onward noted in its report; support had been ""limited"".
The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities says it has supported ""a number of high-profile cutting-edge projects in the North East"", including Britishvolt at Blyth and plans for a carbon capture ""cluster"" at Teesside. ""Across the UK, government action will support up to 190,000 green jobs in the middle of the 2020s and up to 480,000 in 2030, including hundreds of thousands in the North East.""
But with much of the focus of the Tory leadership contest on issues such as tax cuts and migration, little has so far been said about levelling up. Asked about it in Monday night's BBC TV debate, Truss promised a series of lowtax investment zones in the North and Midlands to stimulate growth, while Sunak hinted at cuts to tax on business investment.
Rachel Wolf, co-author of the 2019 Tory manifesto and an advocate of the levelling up agenda, last week warned candidates that domestic policy progress has been ""glacial"" since the election, arguing towns that felt like they had ""decayed year on year"" were looking for delivery.
If that continues, the party risks a backlash from some of its newer voters. ""Imagine you were promised better public services, green jobs and a nicer town centre,"" she said. ""What would you think right now?""
Business leaders in the North East are worried that the region is becoming less of a priority for the government and that tax cuts will further limit funds for investment.
It is ""imperative that any tax-cutting agenda in no way undermines the resilience of public services"", the North East England Chamber of Commerce warned the candidates in a letter last week, noting that a region-wide plan was also needed for green investment. Any cuts ""must not harm investment"" in public bodies that ""play such a central role in the economic success of the North East"".
Tew at South Tyneside council points out that it was Thatcher who brought Nissan to the region with a ""very bespoke incentivised deal"".
""You just don't get that same sense of urgency nationally; that there's a mindset that wants to be bold enough to take those risks,"" he says.
Part of the idea behind levelling up is an effort to generate jobs where people live, rather than seeing more of them move to the biggest cities. One of the greatest obstacles to achieving this — and the area where help from Westminster is most sought after — is in training.
John McCabe, chief executive of the North East England Chamber of Commerce, believes there is ""massive potential"" in green jobs, but skills remain the ""single biggest challenge"" — in part because of limited funding.
""Further education budgets per pupil are going to be 10 per cent lower than they were in 2010,"" he points out. ""If you're talking about building the economy around new technology and industry, it's self-evident you've got to enter that with the right skills to unlock that potential.""
Karen Burgess, who works at the North East Local Enterprise Partnership, the region's network of councils and businesses, agrees, although she says the greater flexibility of the government's green skills ""boot camps"", which will be launched shortly, ""gives us hope"".
The six to 16-week short courses provide the ideal opportunity for people to reskill, she believes. ""If you're a gas fitter at the moment, you could use the boot camp that enables you to fit heat pumps, for example.""
South Tyneside college is moving from its dilapidated 1960s building on the outskirts of South Shields to a new site on the high street. Mandy Morris, the principal, hopes it will make opportunities more visible. ""I was shocked when I met some adults and they said 'College, me? No chance',"" she says. ""In the centre of town I want something outside that'll say anyone can come in this building.""
Green jobs are not a panacea Business leaders in the North East acknowledge, however, that greater assistance from Westminster is not the only obstacle. The region as a whole, which has a messy jigsaw of councils and mayors, also needs to get better at seeing the bigger picture.
""I think we need a more holistic view of the North East and the part it can play,"" says Beeton, chief executive of Port of Tyne.
McCabe, of the chamber of commerce, agrees: ""As businesses we don't recognise local authority boundaries or mayoral boundaries or constituency boundaries because business doesn't work like that.""
While potentially ""transformative"", he does not believe green jobs alone should replace the old industries. ""We wouldn't want a return to things built around one or two sectors in the way that historically we've done before with shipbuilding and coal. We need a bit more diversity,"" he says.
Hawksbee at Onward says that ""the green economy is not going to generate the same level of medium-level and technical jobs that industry did a century ago,"" meaning many people will still need to travel to the nearby cities of Newcastle or Sunderland.
John Tomaney, professor of urban and regional planning at the Bartlett School of Planning at UCL, agrees there is ""massive potential"" for South Shields in green jobs, which could be held back by lack of skills and domestic finance.
""The needs of a place like South Shields are complex and are going to require a more multi-faceted set of solutions than supporting the emergence of green industries,"" he says.
For the arts centre's Spencer, South Shields has already moved on, beyond what is understood by Westminster. ""We are pushing ahead, but I sometimes think the South East is slow at catching up with us, about knowing.""
""Investors still think it's dark satanic mills and shipyards and flat caps here,"" he says, gesturing to the mosaic. ""But in that river, we've changed.""'These are places that have got quite a lot of deprivation and [some] industries aren't offering that many jobs anymore' 'I was shocked when I met some adults and they said ""College, me?

Norway's Equinor and Spain's Iberdrola revealed bumper profits yesterday as the energy groups benefited from turmoil in commodity markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. State-controlled Equinor said that it would return an additional $3bn to shareholders as it reported adjusted pre-tax earnings of $17.6bn in the three months to the end of June.
The profit figure was up threefold on the same period last year on the back of higher gas prices and increased production that helped Norway to displace Russia as Europe's largest supplier.
Iberdrola, Europe's largest utility, recorded a 36 per cent year-on-year rise in net profit to €2.08bn in the first six months of 2022 on revenues of €24.4bn, helped by strong performance in the US and Brazil even as it was unable to pass on higher costs to consumers in its home market of Spain.
The earnings highlight how corners of the industry are experiencing an uplift from surging gas and power prices after Russia slashed supplies to Europe, causing a global squeeze in the availability of energy.
Gas prices in Europe are 10 times higher than their average over the 2010s, while benchmark power prices have hit record levels in Germany and France.
Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, said that it had ramped up production of gas in Norway by 18 per cent to help meet European demand following the withdrawal of vast Russian volumes.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine impacted already tight energy markets and has created an energy crisis with high prices affecting people and all sectors of society,"" said chief executive Anders Opedal.
""Equinor continues to provide high gas production from the Norwegian continental shelf.""
Equinor resumed LNG exports from Hammerfest last month after a 2020 fire at the site, which at full production can meet the annual gas demand of 6.5mn European homes.
Iberdrola's fortunes contrast with those of other European utilities such as Germany's Uniper and France's EDF, whose respective national governments are moving to nationalise and which have suffered from their exposure to Russian gas. Even so, Iberdrola faced difficulties in Spain where it suffered a 26 per cent fall in net profit after struggling to pass on costs to consumers from higher gas and power prices.
European utilities have been in a bind after Russia cut gas flows at a time when generation from hydro and wind sources dropped because of hot and dry weather. They must instead buy more costly gas and power from the market but receive fixed prices from customers on multiyear contracts.
ScottishPower, Iberdrola's UK subsidiary, launched its biggest-ever recruitment drive yesterday, with an aim to hire more than 1,000 people in the next 12 months.
Fernando Garcia, an analyst at RBC, said the current gas supply disruption was helping to improve the economics for low-carbon power generation.
""Low marginal cost generation in Spain with hydro, nuclear or renewables is increasingly profitable in the current energy commodities scenario,"" he said. See Markets'Russia's invasion ... has created an energy crisis with high prices affecting ... all sectors of society'

| Jump to first hitEuropean energy companies started using gas from underground storage facilities to make up for supplies lost due to maintenance work on Russia's Nord Stream 1 pipeline.According to data from Gas Infrastructure Europe (GIE), 85.5 million cubic meters of natural gas were withdrawn from German UGS facilities on July 12, RT reported.They exceeded the injection level for the first time since the beginning of April, data showed.The largest withdrawals were made by German energy major Uniper, Austrian OMV and Norwegian Equinor.Earlier, Uniper announced it did not rule out having to take gas from UGS facilities and reduce supplies as early as this week, while OMV announced a decrease in gas deliveries to Austria by about 70% amid the shutdown.The situation has been exacerbated by production problems in Norway, Europe's second largest natural gas supplier after Russia.Equinor's Sleipner gas field in the North Sea was forced to temporarily halt production this week due to multiple leaks.Romania and Belgium also started tapping into reserves on July 12, as the shutdown of the Sleipner field also affected supplies to the Zeebrugge gas receiving terminal in Belgium.As of July 12, the total reserves in Europe's gas storage facilities amounted to 62.57% of capacity, which is about 1.5% lower than the average for this date over the past five years. Currently, Europe has about 67 billion cubic meters of gas. Daily injection rates are roughly two times lower than before the shutdown of supplies via Nord Stream. The pipeline, which is one of the major routes for Russian gas supplies to Europe, is undergoing scheduled maintenance from 11- 21 July. But even before the shutdown it was operating at just 40% capacity because critical pipeline components were not returned to Russia due to Western sanctions.Currently, the only remaining route for Russian gas supplies to the countries of Western and Central Europe is the transit line through Ukraine. However, those were cut by nearly half in May when Kiev shut down the Sokhranovka entry point, with only the Sudzha transit route still in operation. Gas supplies via Turkish Stream and Blue Stream have not been affected, but they are intended for Turkey and the countries of Southern and South-Eastern Europe.The European Union is planning out a set of emergency measures to mitigate the impact of a potential Russian gas cutoff, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. Among the measures being considered are stockpiling, directing supply to key industries, and placing restrictions on public use.The steps are laid out in a draft document seen by Bloomberg, which calls for early joint action at EU level to address the bloc's fears that Russia may abruptly cut off the gas supply to the continent. Acting now could reduce the impact of a sudden supply disruption by one third, the European Commission stated in the document, which Bloomberg noted is still subject to change before it is adopted as policy next week. According to the document, gas flows from Russia are now less than 30% of the 2016-2021 average. Should Russia pull the plug, the EU would like to have gas reserves at 80% in order to reduce the impact of a sudden supply disruption by a third"".The EU plans to recommend that countries prioritize supply chains and key industries in the event of a cutoff, while incentivizing reduced usage through market-based measures, such as auctions or tender systems - which would drive up prices. Domestic consumers will be hit with information campaigns urging them to reduce their home heating - as has already happened in several countries - and would have mandatory limits placed on their gas usage during an alert level of crisis, in Bloomberg's words. -FNA"

The Norwegian government stepped in to end a strike that threatened to more than halve the country's gas exports, saying it was causing widespread risks to energy security.
Before the strike was halted, a benchmark for gas futures contracts in northwestern Europe rose as much as 14% to €172.88, or about $180, a megawatt-hour Tuesday, the highest level since March. Electricity prices across the region also rose, as many power plants run on gas.
Norway is the second-largest provider of gas to the European Union after Russia, supplying about 25% of the bloc's consumption. The strike has reduced Norway's daily gas exports by about 1% so far, but this could escalate to 56% by Saturday, according to the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, which represents the country's oil companies.
""The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy believes that it would be indefensible to cease gas production in the scope entailed by this strike over the next few days. Production is falling dramatically, and this is highly critical in a situation where the EU and the U.K. are entirely dependent on their energy partnership with Norway,"" said Minister of Labor and Social Inclusion Marte Mjøs Persen.
Three of Norway's oil and gas fields, operated by state-controlled energy major Equinor ASA, were shut Tuesday, according to the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. There were plans to shut production across four more fields Wednesday. If the strike continued through Saturday, that would mean ceased operations of an additional 12 fields and reduced output from another two, the association said.
The parties have agreed to end the strike so that everyone can return to their posts as soon as possible, the Norwegian government said in a statement on Tuesday evening.
The strike came at a time when Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions by Western countries have heightened Europe's energy-security risks.
The EU has implemented a phased ban on oil imports from Russia, but not yet on gas. In retaliation, Russia has cut gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria and Finland , and reduced flows to Germany. Nord Stream 1, a major pipeline connecting Russia to Western and Central Europe, is set to begin maintenance next week, which will result in more disruptions.
European gas prices hit record highs earlier this year, before partially easing as warmer weather reduced demand. High energy prices drove inflation in the eurozone to an annual rate of 8.6% in June, also a record. This has weighed on consumers and provoked strikes across industries for higher wages, including by transport workers in the U.K. , airport and energy-sector workers in France and now, oil workers in Norway.
In France, the price of electricity for delivery in winter has soared after 12 of the country's nuclear reactors were shut down because of corrosion discovered in their piping. The availability of nuclear power is at an all-time low, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Officials don't expect to resolve the problem before winter arrives.
Norwegian consumer prices rose by an annual 5.7% in May, the latest data showed.
""Scorching inflation has provoked a summer of strikes across Europe and now Norwegian oil workers have joined in, and their action is set to exacerbate the pain of rising prices,"" said Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The action by offshore workers on rigs is leading to even tighter supply in the already squeezed energy market.""
The striking employees were largely senior staff managing offshore platform operations. About 74 walked out Tuesday, with another 117 planned for Wednesday, according to the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. The oil workers in Norway were striking because a general pay rise of 32,300 kroner, or about $3,280, and other compensation increases were rejected by union members, said the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association.

| Jump to first hitWhen I worked in the Canadian oilpatch, it was a rough-and-tumble place guided by explorers and engineers who worked hard to sustain a healthy mix of producing assets and exploratory risk-taking. Today, industry consensus among Canada's larger oil players seems to be heading in a different direction. Suncor Energy and Cenovus Energy recently announced plans to forego higher-risk exploration opportunities and concentrate their efforts in the oilsands. This bulking up on producing oilsands assets and shedding exploration opportunities to foreign investors makes dollars and sense in the short term. But these energy leaders risk becoming one-trick ponies, while a lack of diversification in the oil sector may not serve Canadians'longer-term interests.
In April, Suncor Energy announced it was divesting its wind and solar projects and assets in Norway and the United Kingdom to focus on its crown jewels, the oilsands. More recently, Cenovus Energy reached an agreement with BP Plc to buy out BP's 50 per cent interest in the Sunrise oilsands project in exchange for cash and Cenovus's 35 per cent position in the undeveloped Bay du Nord project off Newfoundland and Labrador. This deal gives Cenovus full ownership of Sunrise, while Canada's most significant hydrocarbon exploration play, Bay du Nord, is now owned by foreign investors.
The Bay du Nord offshore project will require huge injections of cash to build, and the Atlantic Ocean is not a tame place to operate. Shareholders of BP and Equinor (the Norwegian company that operates the project) aren't likely to see returns for a decade. For Cenovus's investors, meanwhile, a higher-risk, longer-term investment couldn't compete with the immediate opportunity to build on a proven oilsands base at a good price.
If the game plan is to pay off debt, repurchase shares and increase dividends for remaining shareholders, it's smart to hunker down and focus on ways to squeeze maximum profits from the oilsands.
Investors in oilsands projects are clearly attracted to the assets'long term production trajectories. On the other hand, they recognize that bitumen producers are constrained in their ability to grow the assets through the drill bit because governments have imposed an overall GHG cap. Alberta's Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act establishes an annual emissions limit (100 megatonnes) for cumulative GHG emissions from all oilsands sites in the province. In addition, federal politicians are thrashing out a plan to impose caps on emissions from oil and gas production in Canada as part of Ottawa's ambitious 2030 Emissions Reduction Plan.
Oilsands producers have to be prepared to invest big in carbon-reducing infrastructure so as to meet the federal government's climate goals and comply with voluntary ESG pledges. Both the uncertainty surrounding legislated GHG caps and the anticipated cost of carbon-reduction technology have helped persuade non-Canadian investors to sell off their oilsands stakes, most often to Canadian operators. In the past few years, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Equinor and Devon Energy have exited. Industry insiders say they won't be surprised to see other non-local players - companies like TotalEnergies, Chevron and CNOOC - off-load their oilsands assets, too.
It's fair to ask: is it a bad thing for Canadians to have a concentration of Canadian operators coming together to figure out more effective ways to produce the oilsands, leaving higher-risk exploring for new oil reserves to foreign investors? Perhaps not, as long as the oil that's needed still gets discovered and governments receive their royalty cheques. In fact, if hydrocarbons are being fast-tracked for extinction in Canada, why should we even care about future oil potential? We won't need to find any new oil reserves if we're not going to develop them.
In a perfect world, such questions would be reasonable. But as the war in Ukraine has laid bare, companies and countries can pay a high price if they are not prepared for disruptions in their best-laid plans. Canadian energy companies have built up decades of credible expertise in oil exploration and production, and we don't know for certain what talents will be required in future to assure our own energy security or that of other nations. The oil business in Canada may well be in liquidation mode but if the timeline for transition to cleaner energy is disrupted, whether by game-changing technology or by geopolitical necessity, trading an opportunity to sustain a diversified mix of assets and skills in exchange for short-term efficiencies could end up being short-sighted.

Oil and gas producers have warned Rishi Sunak that his windfall tax on their profits could force the cancellation of projects and spur investors to deploy capital elsewhere.
At a meeting with the chancellor in Aberdeen yesterday, about 20 executives from UK North Sea operators — including Equinor, Harbour Energy, Ithaca Energy and Shell — criticised the 25 per cent ""energy profits levy"". The windfall tax, imposed by Sunak in May, is designed to partly fund a £15bn support package for households struggling with soaring energy bills. It raises the headline tax rate paid by North Sea producers to 65 per cent.
Simon Roddy, senior vice-president for Shell's UK upstream oil and gas business, told Sunak the levy sent a ""negative signal"" that was undermining investment in British waters, according to people at the meeting.
An executive from Equinor suggested that the Norwegian state-backed energy company was questioning whether the UK was a sensible place to invest, said several people at the meeting.
Equinor is leading on one of the biggest investments in the UK North Sea, the £4.5bn Rosebank oil and gasfield 130km north-west of the Shetland Islands. Equinor said later it was committed to delivering Rosebank and planned to take a final investment decision in the spring of 2023.
An executive from Serica Energy told
Sunak the tax would disproportionately harm smaller producers, as their larger rivals had global portfolios of assets.
Executives asked for a review of the tax every six months. The levy has a socalled sunset clause that would remove it at the end of 2025. The industry also wants greater clarity on what the trigger might be for the removal of the tax.
When Sunak announced the levy, the Treasury described it as ""temporary"" and said it would ""be phased out when oil and gas prices return to historically more normal levels"". This month, he indicated a retreat in prices to a range of $60 to $70 a barrel might trigger the levy's repeal. Brent crude was trading at $111 a barrel yesterday.
Executives would also like carbon capture and storage projects to be eligible for the investment allowance Sunak announced with the levy. It is designed to encourage companies to press ahead with schemes to boost production.
One executive at the meeting said Sunak ""was lacking in answers to the main questions the industry had"".
Another person said: ""He found himself on the receiving end of some rather robust feedback. The relationship between the Treasury and the oil and gas industry might be characterised as several layers of frost.""
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of the North Sea trade body Offshore Energies UK, described the meeting as ""candid"" and warned that the windfall tax would undermine attempts to attract investment to Britain. Shell, Serica Energy and Harbour Energy declined to comment.
The government said: ""North Sea oil and gas are going to be crucial to the UK's domestic energy supply and security for the foreseeable future, so it is right we continue to encourage investment there."" It added that the investment allowance ""means businesses will overall get a 91p tax saving for every £1 they invest — this nearly doubles the tax relief available"".

| Jump to first hitTHE BOSS of one of the UK's leading energy industry bodies has ramped up her criticisms of the recently imposed windfall tax - describing the measure as ""punitive"" and warning it could undermine a ""remarkable British success story"".
Deirdre Michie, chief executive of Onshore Energies UK argued yesterday the new levy will damage the North Sea's investment climate and jeopardise oil and gas investments which can take decades to develop.
Speaking at Onshore Energies UK's summer reception, she said: ""Tax announcements like the windfall tax risk achieving the opposite of what politicians say they actually want and could result in undermining energy security and ultimately the energy transition itself."" Her comments follow Chancellor Rishi Sunak last month unveiling the Energy Profits Levy - a further 25 per cent tax on North Sea oil and gas companies to ease the pressure on households from spiralling energy bills.
The tariff is on top of the 40 per cent special rate of corporation tax North Sea operators already pay.
The levy is expected to raise £5bn - which will partially fund a £15bn support package for households that will offer up £1,200 per year in savings to vulnerable energy users.
BP and Shell posted record quarterly profits of $6.2bn (£5.06bn) and $9.1bn respectively this year, amid soaring oil and gas prices, and the government has deemed them a viable target for revenue raising to ease energy bills.
At the weekend, there were media reports that Equinor was weighing up a withdrawal from the £4.5bn project at the Rosebank field near the Shetland Isles - reflecting industry unease over the windfall tax.
However, Equinor told City A.M. it has no intention of pulling out of Rosebank field, despite its reservations about the new levy."

| Jump to first hitONE BILLION more cubic meters of gas will enter the UK market for each of the next three winters, after energy giants Centrica and Equinor announced a major gas delivery agreement yesterday.
The deal will see Equinor deliver to the British Gas owner enough gas over the coming three years to heat an additional 4.5m homes.
Centrica will now buy a total of 10 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Norwegian giant Equinor - a hefty chunk of the UK's typical yearly gas demand.
Currently, the UK is importing around a third of its gas requirements from Norway, with the country becoming increasingly significant in UK plans to ensure the security of supplies following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Centrica is the largest supplier of electricity and gas in the UK, serving nine million customers through its British Gas business.
Chris O'Shea, Centrica's chief executive, said: ""This agreement is good news for our customers and the country. At a time when energy security is paramount, I'm pleased that we are able to do our bit to ease the pressure and provide some more certainty ahead of what may be a difficult winter."" Helge Haugane, senior vice president of gas and power at Equinor, added: ""We are committed to further strengthen the strategic relationship with Centrica and the UK, both in supplying oil and gas and by playing a leading role in delivering on the UK's decarbonisation ambitions.""
The government argued the deal reflected the key role of natural gas in the UK's energy mix.
Business and energy secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""While we ramp up cheap renewables and accelerate British nuclear to boost our greater energy independence, we will still need natural gas for many decades to come.""
Commenting on recent geopolitical factors, he added: ""With Russia's criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is more important than ever that we source more of the gas we need domestically, but also from safe and reliable import partners while we transition. We cannot, and will not, turn off the taps overnight.""
Meanwhile, City A.M. understands Centrica is one of three suppliers in the race to sign Bulb Energy."

| Jump to first hitThe launch of the UK’s first carbon storage licensing round has been hailed as an “important day on the path to net zero”.
Andy Samuel, the chief executive of the North Sea Transition Authority, spoke out as the process of areas being offered for carbon capture and storage schemes got under way.
Sites being offered in this round include areas off the coast of Aberdeen, as well as Teesside, Liverpool and Lincolnshire.
The NSTA has already awarded ad hoc licences to bp and Equinor for four separate storage sites around 43 miles off the coast of Humberside.

Combined with the existing licence granted for the Endurance carbon store, they could eventually contribute to the storage of up to 23 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2 around 1,400 m beneath the seabed. The government’s target for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage is to reach 20-30 mtpa by 2030, and over 50 mtpa by 2035.
The level of interest in the new licences suggest there will be strong competition for what could be the first of many licensing rounds – with estimates suggesting up to 100 carbon dioxide stores could be needed if the UK is to meet its target of reaching net zero by 2050.
The carbon capture and storage schemes allow for CO2 emissions from industry to be transported – either by ships or in pipelines – before being stored offshore, deep underground in geological formations.
Organisations now have 90 days to make an application, with the NSTA due to evaluate the bids based on their technical and financial criteria after September 13.
A spokesperson for bp said: “bp already holds storage licences on behalf of the Northern Endurance Partnership that will serve the East Coast Cluster. Today the NSTA announced new acreage for which it invites bids.
“bp will evaluate these opportunities and respond to NSTA ahead of the September closing date.”
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “It’s great to see additional capacity being made for carbon storage following the great news that bp and Equinor had recently secured their licences to develop the UK’s first decarbonised industrial cluster, right here on Teesside.

“It’s a superb opportunity for more businesses to take advantage of these pioneering technologies helping us to meet our net zero ambitions, but it will help create thousands of good-quality, well paid jobs for local workers in the cleaner, safer and healthier industries of tomorrow.”
It is expected new licences will be awarded early next year – with the possibility some schemes could be up and running within four to six years of that.
Speaking as the licensing round opened, Mr Samuel said: “This is an important day on the path to net zero emissions.
“In addition to the huge environmental benefits of significantly reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, the facilities will provide opportunities for many thousands of highly-skilled jobs.
“Carbon storage is going to be needed across the world. There is growing investor appetite and we are keen to accelerate development of the carbon storage sector so that the UK is well-positioned to be a global leader.
“The NSTA is ready to work with industry, government, regulators and others to deliver these exciting projects at pace.”
UK energy minister Greg Hands said the Government was determined to “make the UK a world leader in carbon capture”, adding that this “will be crucial in helping us reduce emissions and protect the viability and competitiveness of British industry”.
He said: “This licensing round is an important step in making this a reality, helping support new jobs across the UK and encouraging investment in our industrial heartlands.”
Will Webster, energy policy manager at Offshore Energies UK, said CO2 storage technology could prevent tens of millions of tonnes of CO2 entering the atmosphere.
He said: “Carbon capture technologies will be a key element in helping the UK reach net zero.
“It is particularly important for industry, especially heavy industries which need a lot of energy and so produce a lot of CO2. This applies particularly to the cement and steel industries, petrochemical refineries, and power generation.”
He added: “The UK’s oil and gas sector has a highly skilled workforce used to managing and transporting large volumes of gas safely and they will have all the knowledge needed to make this technology work.”
But Mr Webster added: “This is a long-term project – we want to be able to store 50 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2035 and continue expanding after that.
“That means we need a long-term commitment from government, a clear regulatory framework, and business models that encourage early investment.”"

Some of Europe's lesser-known integrated oil companies might be worth considering for investors who want to take advantage of this year's surge in prices.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, most oil companies have seen their valuations increase as crude prices spiked above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. Natural-gas prices are also at the highest level in years on concerns that supplies are threatened.
European supermajors BP (ticker: BP.U.K.) and Shell (SHEL.U.K.) attract the most headlines. But shares of three smaller companies—TotalEnergies (TTE.France), Repsol (REP.Spain), and Equinor (EQNR.Norway)—are up sharply against a backdrop of falling stock markets. Whether they are worth holding now depends on whether investors prize them at current prices because of the solid outlook for dividends.
""The past 2½ years have been a complete roller coaster,"" says Jason Kenney, head of European oil research at Santander. ""A lot of it was exogenous; nobody could have forecast the kinds of impacts and swings we've seen in oil prices.""
On top of that, oil companies are under pressure as investors prioritize environmental, social, and governance-friendly firms. ESG investors are now realizing that oil companies have money to invest in, and much to gain from, the transition to a low-carbon future.

Paris-based TotalEnergies, the biggest of the three, has a market capitalization of 136 billion euros ($144 billion). Its main business segment is refining and chemicals, and it's one of the largest members of the MSCI Europe ESG Leaders index.
It fetches five times this year's expected earnings, trading in line with peers. Shares are up 14.8% this year at €51.33. Banco Santander rates it a Hold with a target price of €50.90, and it has a dividend yield of 5.4%.
TotalEnergies in April said it would accelerate the pace of share buybacks, pledging to buy $2 billion of its own stock by June after acquiring $1 billion in the first quarter. It also increased the interim dividend by 5% from last year.
Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné was ambivalent on Russia, where TotalEnergies owns a 20% stake in Novatek, the country's largest producer of liquid natural gas. Pouyanné says the company hasn't committed to stay in Russia , but also has yet to say when or if it will pull out.
Norway-based Equinor, with a market value of 1.1 trillion kroner ($110 billion), operates worldwide but is majority-owned by the Norwegian state. It fetches 6.8 times this year's expected earnings and has a dividend yield of 2.4%.
Equinor is paying an extraordinary dividend in the second and third quarters. Shares are up 41% this year to NOK332.05. RBC Capital Markets has a price target of NOK330 and rates the shares a Hold. In its May 4 earnings report, Equinor stuck to plans to keep buybacks and dividends at $10 billion this year.
Madrid-based Repsol has the smallest market capitalization of the three, at €21.3 billion. It fetches five times this year's expected earnings, with a dividend yield of 1.9%. Shares are up 38% to €14.41. Deutsche Bank's James Hubbard has a target price of €16.77. For the first quarter, Repsol said that almost 70% of its profit came from its exploration-and- production business. The company is investing heavily in biofuels and hydrogen gas.
Analysts' price targets suggest further increases in share prices may be limited, but that's against a slumping market—the Euro Stoxx 50 is down more than 10% so far this year. The outlook for energy prices staying high , and the possibility of even bigger distributions to shareholders mean these companies might be worth a look.

| Jump to first hitMore than100 North East business leaders heard first hand from a global energy business the tremendous potential of the region to develop excellence in a low carbon economy.
Guest speaker at the North East England Chamber of Commerce business summit, held at Teesside International Airport, was Louise Kingham, senior vice-president, bp Europe and head of country UK. She set out in clear terms the switch to low carbon from the UK’s traditional power sources, but also highlighted the opportunity it presented.
The global energy company is developing a number of low carbon projects in the region, including leading a consortium of energy businesses on the multimillion-pound Net Zero Teesside Power scheme at Teesworks, a joint venture with Equinor which will build, a gas-fired power plant with carbon capture, utilisation and storage capabilities. It has also announced plans for H2Teesside, a blue hydrogen production facility, and HyGreen Teesside, a green hydrogen facility, which would be based in the region.

Louise said: “Working with our stakeholders, including Chamber member Equinor, our Net Zero Teesside Power project alone would provide power to over 1.3m homes. More broadly our projects have attracted substantial inward investment to the North East, including through recently announced partnerships with ADNOC – the Abu Dhabi National Oil and Gas Company – and Masdar. This region was at the heart of the first industrial revolution and it is now set to be at the heart of the energy transition revolution.”
As well as outlining the individual investment programmes, Louise Kingham also stressed the employment opportunities for local people including in the construction phase and the supply chain. bp has plans in place to help communities train to be ready for jobs in this clean energy sector.
The guests also heard an update on the Teesside Freeport. Director Nolan Gray set out the important part it can play in helping to level up the region with the rest of the country.
.
He also outlined all the opportunities available at the 4,500-acre Freeport, made up of tax and customs zones at sites across the Tees Valley. It is expected to create 18,000 jobs and drive billions into the economy over five years.
Chamber chief executive, John McCabe said: “This Business Summit has set out such a clear vision for the North East and our energy sector. We’ve learnt about so many chances to grow our regional businesses, on our doorstep, with leading edge thinking and technology. There is masses of potential here and its fantastic that we are now on the cusp of exploiting it on a truly, once-in-a-lifetime scale.”
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “Everyone at the airport was delighted to host the Chamber and such a high profile event at Teesside Airport, bringing together some of the region’s biggest business bosses to discover all of the opportunities available in our region and some of the transformational projects we’re driving forward.”
The Business Summit was sponsored by Intuit and also supported by Learning Curve and Teesside International Airport.

| Jump to first hitNATURAL gas buyers in Asia and Europe are seeking to lock in supplies via long-term contracts as a buffer against volatile global prices, industry executives said, in moves that will reverse the last decade's trend of increasing spot purchases. 
Fears of disruptions in Russian gas to Europe and low inventories led the continent to import record volumes of spot liquefied natural gas (LNG), driving prices to all-time highs earlier this year and sparking energy security concerns among buyers globally.
Years of low investments mean new supplies are scarce while Russian supplies are at risk just as more countries have switched from coal to gas to meet climate targets over the past couple of years when LNG prices had been low.
""We see a higher demand now than we had 2 years ago, definitely, so more interest for longer-term contracts, energy security,"" Peder Bjorland, vice-president natural gas marketing and trading at Equinor told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Gas Conference.
He added that European buyers for pipeline and LNG are seeking supplies over a 5 to 10 years time frame while longer-term contracts spanning 15 to 20 years are more attractive for Asian markets.
The duration of LNG contracts is a sticking point in talks between Qatar and Germany for term supplies.
However, European buyers may go through middlemen to bridge the gap, Anne Mai Hatlem, vice-president of LNG at Equinor, said.
""For Europe, we see more companies actually signing up for longer-term deals and that might be a sign of realism related to how fast can we phase out gas from the market,"" she pointed out.
Asian spot LNG prices have fallen about 50 per cent from an all-time high in December, but are up nearly three-fold from levels seen in May 2021 as prices have rallied on tight global supplies with European buyers switching out of Russian natural gas for LNG following the Ukraine conflict.
Price volatility will likely remain given the uncertainty over Russian gas supplies to Europe and weather conditions, industry executives said. While this drives buyers to lock in supplies, it has also become a stumbling block between sellers and buyers to close deals.
""There's a lot of demand for more LNG, obviously, and I think it's very difficult in high volatility to agree on price... Because the buyers will always tell you that these are unnaturally high, and the sellers will say, this is the way things are for a while,"" said Kevin Gallagher, chief executive officer of Santos.
Various benchmarks are also used in long-term contracts with oil indexation still favoured in Asia while more regional markers are being used depending on the origin of supplies to offset margin call risks.
""You see US projects actually offering TTF pricing, for example, on their projects and you see more Asian companies willing to buy on a Henry Hub pricing,"" Equinor's Hatlem said, referring to Dutch wholesale prices and the US price marker.
""So there are again mechanisms in the market to take away some of the margin call risk on the longer term,"" she added. ""Many companies are concerned about ensuring some protection if they are going into long term (deals) for the future."" REUTERS"

| Jump to first hitProserv Group has been signed up by Norwegian global energy specialist Equinor to deploy its pioneering holistic cable monitoring system, ECG at one of the group's top performing offshore wind farms in UK - Hywind Scotland.A leading controls technology company, the Proserv Group incorporates two divisions - Proserv Controls and Gilmore, providing tailored solutions to clients right across the energy sector. Proserv operates worldwide and has offices in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.Proserv said it is set to deliver its cable monitoring system to analyse the condition and integrity of export and inter-array cables across the wind farm utilising the fibre optic cores within the cables. The demonstration, focused on ECG’s data analytics abilities, is scheduled to extend until April 2024 with installation and commissioning at the wind farm set to take place in Q3 of this year.Located off the coast of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire in north-east Scotland, Equinor’s Hywind Scotland became the world’s first commercial floating offshore wind farm in 2017.ECG represents a step change in traditional monitoring methods, offering comprehensive visibility across cable assets as an integrated, scalable and multi-faceted single package, said Proserv in its statement.The technology has been initiated and driven by Proserv with vital support from its consortium partners Synaptec, a power system monitoring expert, and BPP Cable Solutions, specialists in subsea power cable engineering and management. The Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult (OREC) has also given its support to the group during the development of the solution, it stated. The CMS not only employs distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) but engages Synaptec’s unique distributed electromechanical sensors (DES), via its passive electrical and mechanical sensor systems. The hardware will be complemented by the intuitive human-machine interface, utilising Proserv’s TIACS software suite, it added.Critically, Proserv’s ECG can monitor the condition and performance of cable terminations, an aspect needing development in the offshore wind sector. Cable terminations are well-known for being a serious failure point and so this technology solution will scrutinise this specific key area of an asset.During ECG’s demonstration on Hywind Scotland, BPP Cable Solutions will provide advanced real-time data processing and predictive analytics modelling, representing a major shift from traditional reactive cable performance monitoring approaches, whereby a cable fault or failure is analysed from stored data after an event takes place.This will be achieved by BPP Cable Solutions applying its experience in processing data generated from DTS and DAS, as well as Synaptec’s DES and cable connection monitoring technologies. Specialist predictive data analysis tools will be combined with known cable power transmission performance physics to monitor cable arrays continuously and autonomously. This will give assurance of 'as designed' cable health and will identify in advance any anomalies and potential longer-term faults that can be dealt with on a proactive basis.Proserv Business Development Director (Renewables) Paul Cook said: ""We are most grateful to Equinor for enabling us to supply our ECG cable monitoring solution to the Hywind Scotland wind farm and to display the potential and power of this technology, including its data analytics capabilities.""""Owners and operators urgently need a cohesive O&M strategy around their cable assets and with its scrutiny of terminations, alongside its unique predictive insights, ECG offers unrivalled visibility of this key part of an offshore wind farm’s infrastructure,"" he stated.""Equally, as floating wind scales up rapidly, this arrangement on Hywind Scotland represents perfect timing for us to show what ECG can do,"" he added.Earlier this year, it was announced that Proserv had secured a contract for ECG to be implemented on the bottom-fixed Dogger Bank Wind Farm phases A and B to monitor the condition and integrity of the asset’s inter-array cables, representing the technology’s first commercial sale. Dogger Bank will become the world’s largest offshore wind farm once completed.Hywind Scotland has a reputation for being the UK’s top performing offshore wind farm, holding the best rolling 12-month capacity factor across the nation for the past few years, and currently performing comfortably above 55%.Proserv Controls CEO Davis Larssen said: ""The deployment of ECG to Hywind Scotland marks another important stepping stone towards this disruptive technology becoming the benchmark solution for cable asset management in offshore wind.""""In a few short months we have seen ECG being selected to support the operation of the world’s biggest offshore wind farm, due to the strength of its proposition, and now it will be supplied to a well-established floating asset, indicating its flexibility, versatility and relevance to the entire offshore wind sector,"" he added.-TradeArabia News Service"

| Jump to first hitTeesside's drive to help the UK reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 has taken a sizeable step forward with the award of two carbon storage licences in the North Sea.
The North Sea Transition Authority has awarded the licences to bp and Equinor with an appraisal term of eight years to show progress achieving milestones, such as performing seismic surveys of the four proposed storage sites and drilling wells to acquire data before applying for a storage permit.
Read more: BP plans Teesside jobs boost at powerplant and hydrogen projects
The four separate storage sites are located around 43 miles off the coast of Humberside. Combined with the existing licence granted for the Endurance carbon store, they could eventually contribute to the storage of up to 23 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of CO2 around 1,400 m beneath the seabed. The government’s target for Carbon Capture, Usage and Storage is to reach 20-30 mtpa by 2030, and over 50 mtpa by 2035.
Andy Lane, Northern Endurance Partnership Managing Director, said: “The North Sea Transition Authority’s decision to grant bp and Equinor carbon storage licences is great news for the Humber, Teesside and the East Coast Cluster, which represents almost 50% of the UK’s industrial cluster CO2 emissions.
“This is another important milestone for the East Coast Cluster which will capture and safely store CO2 emissions from a wide range of industrial and power projects, protect and create thousands of jobs and help establish the Teesside and Humber regions as a globally-competitive climate-friendly hub for industry and innovation.”
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen added: “This is yet another welcome next step for the East Coast Cluster, which will play a key part in delivering Net Zero Teesside Power’s gas-fired power plant with CCUS capabilities in Teesside and, ultimately, a pioneering UK-first decarbonised industrial cluster.
“Not only is this pioneering project vital if we are to meet our net zero ambitions, but it will also create thousands of good-quality, well paid jobs for local workers in the cleaner, safer and healthier industries of tomorrow.”
Grete Tveit, Senior Vice President for Low Carbon Solutions, Equinor, said: “This is a major milestone for the East Coast Cluster project which will make a tangible impact in the UK’s climate change ambitions.
“Delivered with our partners in the Humber, Teesside and the Northern Endurance Partnership, the East Coast Cluster will establish the UK as a leader in the energy transition.”
Energy and Climate Change Minister Greg Hands said: “Carbon capture provides a key opportunity for the future of the North Sea, as well as UK industries. We are determined to make the UK a world-leader in this developing market and these licences represent an important contribution to making that a reality.”
Current project estimates indicate that earliest injection from a CS project could come as soon as 2025 given the progress already seen in the HyNet, Northern Endurance Partnership’s East Coast Cluster and V Net Zero Humber Cluster projects.
Scott Robertson, NSTA Director of Operations, said: “The NSTA is pleased to award these licences which have the potential to make a significant contribution towards the government’s net zero target.
“Carbon storage and low carbon gas production, alongside growth in hydrogen and renewable energy, are all key elements of the energy transition and a crucial part in tackling the climate emergency.
""But we know that time is short and real action must be taken rapidly, so we will work closely with bp and Equinor to ensure that milestones on this project are met, as we do with other projects across the North Sea.”

| Jump to first hitSome major businesses of Denmark and Norway have expressed their special interest in developing offshore wind power in Vietnam during recent meetings with officials of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT).At the 26th United Nations Conference on Climate Change (COP26) held in the UK last November, Vietnam committed to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.Talking to Danish Chargé d'Affaires, a.i. Troels Jakobsen and Executive Vice President and CEO of the Orsted group Martin Neubert, Minister Nguyen Hong Dien said offshore wind power development is highly significant since it can be combined with the realisation of socio-economic growth, energy security, and industrialisation targets towards low-carbon emissions and net zero emissions by 2050.He expressed his hope that Orsted, which is the world's biggest offshore wind power developer, will share its experience in this field so as to help Vietnam carry out effective energy transition projects that suit local development demand.Neubert said his group views Vietnam as a new and also important market. It opened an office in the country in December 2020 with the hope of making more concrete contributions to the formation of an offshore wind power industry in Vietnam.The firm is building a plan on launching the industry in Vietnam through two projects it is implementing in coordination with the T&T Group, he went on, noting that through its concrete activities and objectives, Orsted hopes to accompany the Vietnamese Government during the realisation of the COP26 commitments.Equinor, a large energy business of Norway, also showed its attention to the local sector.Addressing a working session with Deputy Minister Dang Hoang An, an Equinor official said it has opened a representative office in Hanoi, which affirmed Norway's readiness and determination to contribute to Vietnam's offshore wind power development, green transition, and implementation of the commitments in the Paris Agreement on climate change and at COP26.Equinor recently cooperated with the MoIT to study the development of an offshore wind power supply chain. This study's results were handed over to the MoIT in October 2021.In March 2021, it also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Vietnam Oil and Gas Group (PetroVietnam) to assess the feasibility of cooperation in developing offshore wind power and renewable energy.In the draft National Power Development Plan VIII, Vietnam looks to develop 16,121 MW of onshore and inshore wind power, along with about 7,000 MW of the offshore one by 2030. Wind power is set to make up 15.8 percent of the capacity of the electricity generation system, including 4.8 percent from offshore wind power. - VNA"

Dogger Bank Wind Farm will be fully operational by 2026 and it will be run from a state-of-the-art operations and maintenance base currently being built at Tyne Dock Enterprise Park (TDEP) part of the Port of Tyne’s Tyne Clean Energy Park. SSE Renewables is managing the construction phase of the wind farm and Equinor will operate the wind farm for its 35-year lifetime, which will supply renewable power to the equivalent of around 6 million homes.
Port of Tyne’s chief commercial officer, Charlotte Brown, said: “We are exceptionally proud to be supporting the development of the operations and maintenance base for the world’s largest offshore wind farm at Tyne Clean Energy Park. The project will bring jobs and opportunities for South Tyneside throughout the supply chain and we look forward to the impact it will have on the region.”
The wind farm is investing millions in the operational building itself with over £7m being spent in the regional supply chain and over half of that directly with companies in the South Tyneside area.
Many North East companies have also benefited from sub-contracts during the construction phase of the wind farm itself.
One of the local Chamber members benefiting from the local approach is South Tyneside-based Metec Cathodic Protection. This Jarrow firm manufactures long-term corrosion protection products for steel piles, offshore structures and foundations for the port, harbour and offshore renewable energy industry.
Metec has won two tenders for Dogger Bank Wind Farm via other companies in the supply chain. The first one is a six figure value contract to supply and install a 25-year protection system for the sheet pile wall at the Equinor facility at TDEP.
This work is in addition to Metec’s larger offshore renewable contract of £6.5 million to supply corrosion protection for the Dogger Bank Wind Farm itself.
Established in 2016, Metec UK, has manufacturing facilities in Tunisia as well as South Tyneside, with representation around the globe. Initially employing just six people, the company now has a team of up to 45, with over half of its talent pool coming from South Tyneside.

Another Chamber member benefitting from the project is Darlington-based Tekmar Energy, part of Tekmar Group, an engineering services and technology provider for the global offshore energy markets. Tekmar Energy will provide a highly engineered cable protection solution, including the Cable Protection System (CPS), under what is its largest contract win to date.
All systems will be manufactured at Tekmar Energy’s state-of-the-art facility in Newton Aycliffe, 50km from Dogger Bank’s third phase export cable landfall site in Teesside. The first systems are expected to be delivered from August 2022, with production continuing into 2024.
The project benefits from Tekmar Group’s unique engineering capability and extensive industry experience. Tekmar Energy is working alongside sister companies Subsea Innovation (Darlington), AgileTek Engineering and Ryder Geotechnical (Newcastle) to deliver a holistic cable protection solution that overcomes the wind farm’s challenging site conditions.
Gary Howland, Tekmar group sales director, said: “As a company headquartered in the North East, we are extremely proud to play a part in this hugely significant project for the region.”
The Dogger Bank Wind Farm will be located 130km off the North East coast of England. It will be capable of generating enough renewable energy to power six million UK homes once fully operational.
More than 3,000 new UK jobs have been announced so far that will be supported by the construction and operation of Dogger Bank Wind Farm. One rotation of the Haliade-X turbine blades to be installed there will be able to power one UK home for more than two days.
Michelle Wilcox, Chamber senior relationship manager said: “This development is tremendous for not just South Tyneside but the whole region. The employment opportunities and prestigious contracts for our North East businesses are unrivalled. This investment by Equinor and its partners is a massive vote of confidence in us all and our growing expertise in the offshore and renewables sector.”

WASHINGTON—The nation's biggest oil industry trade group has drafted a proposal urging Congress to adopt a carbon tax , which would put a surcharge on gasoline and other fossil fuels to discourage greenhouse-gas emissions.
The draft proposal was approved by the American Petroleum Institute's climate committee last month, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The measure must still be approved by the group's executive committee.
A carbon tax would raise gasoline prices and other energy costs for consumers. Some API members want to delay action on the proposal amid near- record prices at the pump , contending it could alienate not only voters but Republican lawmakers friendly to the oil industry ahead of midterm elections , according to people involved in the discussions or who were briefed on them.
""The worst case is not get the policy, and lose the friends,"" one of the people said. ""Today, that's probably the most likely possibility.""
The API proposal calls for assessing gasoline wholesalers, power plants and others a tax starting at $35 to $50 a ton for carbon dioxide generated by the fossil fuel they sell or use, with annual adjustments for inflation and other factors, according to the document reviewed by the Journal,
Some Democrats who once supported a carbon tax now oppose it, on grounds that the costs are passed on to consumers, including many who can't afford it. The API proposal suggests rebating some of the revenue collected by the carbon tax to households and to invest the rest of the money in new technology.
The draft proposal says a carbon tax is ""the most impactful and transparent way to achieve meaningful progress on the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions while simultaneously ensuring continued economic growth.""
The measure is a follow-up to last year's decision by API to push Congress for legislation to price carbon emissions across the economy, in what was a policy turnabout a decade after the organization helped to kill a similar plan .
API spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren said the proposal is under a routine review by the organization, which she said was ""focused on the most transparent and impactful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest cost for American families.""
Several climate committee members pushed to send the measure to the API's executive committee for final approval, the people said. Instead the measure was referred to API's lobbying committee, which has pushed to delay the completion and rollout of the policy until later this year, they said.
Some API members, including representatives of European-based producers Shell PLC and Equinor ASA, want API to take action quickly on the carbon-tax proposal to show that climate change is a top priority, according to the people.
""Shell remains committed to taking actions and convening important conversations, including at API, that could ultimately lead to putting a price on carbon,"" a Shell spokesman said.
An Equinor spokesperson declined to comment on the API proposal but said the company ""is a long-standing advocate of carbon pricing, which we see as being a key enabler of the energy transition.""
Companies including Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66, along with API's lobbying team, argued a delay was necessary to help the industry avoid political blowback because a carbon tax has become unpopular among both conservatives and liberals, the people said.
A Hess spokeswoman said the company has supported pricing carbon emissions generally in its securities filings. A Phillips 66 spokesman said the company supported the API carbon pricing framework but didn't address the carbon tax proposal approved last month.
""An economywide carbon price appears to be one of the more efficient and effective ways to reduce carbon emissions,"" a Marathon spokesman said. ""However, as with any policy initiative, details will be very important.""
Some within API are concerned that coming out in favor of the tax now could anger Congressional Republicans, who have long been staunch allies of the oil industry. Some of these lawmakers were displeased last year when API publicly pivoted on climate change, calling on Congress to address it with policies such as a price on carbon.
Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), Republican leader of the House Select Climate Committee, said Thursday the idea of a carbon tax ""is just idiotic right now"" given Russia's invasion of Ukraine and high energy prices.
""It is mind-boggling that anyone could look at the current state of affairs and conclude that putting an additional tax on American gasoline and energy is a solution for anything,"" he said.
API's Ms. Bloomgren said any carbon pricing system should address what she called ""hidden taxes and overlapping regulations"" to mitigate the impact of a carbon tax on U.S. consumers.
Earlier this week, the Business Roundtable, an association of top U.S. executives, announced energy policy recommendations that included ""a price on carbon where it is environmentally and economically effective."" The group didn't specifically call for a carbon tax, however.
The action drew a sharp rebuke from three Republican lawmakers.
""If the Business Roundtable really wanted to promote a forward-thinking energy strategy for America, they would stand up for their members and American workers by advocating for more American energy production to lower costs and carbon emissions,"" said a statement from House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R., Okla.) and Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.).
Those pushing for delaying action on the carbon tax want to wait until after the midterm elections, when Republicans could retake control of the House and Senate, the people said. Their view is that Republicans would still likely oppose the carbon tax after the election, but would be less likely to get angry at the oil industry if it doesn't push the issue during an election year, the people said.
Others within API are skeptical, seeing a delay as a potentially deadly blow to the effort. This year may be the only chance to pass such policy with Democrats now crafting a climate and energy bill , which Republicans said they would oppose.
The rift over the carbon-tax proposal is the latest in a series of disputes within API over the industry's approach to climate change.
TotalEnergies SE of France canceled its API membership last year citing disagreements on climate policy, while Shell and BP PLC—both based in London—have their membership under review.
That puts them at odds with U.S. independents and refiners whose businesses are more closely tied to selling crude and gasoline. They have been slower to support climate policy that may make their products more expensive.
In recent years, much of the industry has come out in favor of carbon pricing as a way to show they are willing to address climate change. That shift took a credibility hit last year when an Exxon Mobil Corp. lobbyist, tricked into being recorded by Greenpeace, said his company's support for a carbon tax was merely an ""easy talking point"" because it is a policy unlikely to ever be implemented. Exxon later disavowed those comments .

Is instituting a carbon tax a viable option to fight climate change? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The carbon tax would ultimately be paid by consumers. The proposal recommends placing stickers on gasoline pumps to show motorists the carbon tax added to the price of a gallon of gasoline, and says transparency on the cost of the policy would help consumers understand how to limit their own emissions.
In a nod to likely objections to a tax increase that would be felt by consumers, the proposal states ""the categorical implementation of a federal carbon tax regime should not be at the expense of economic expansion.""
Other key recommendations in the proposal include rebates for exporters and tariffs on imports that come from countries without a carbon tax, with the proposal calling it necessary for U.S. competitiveness. And it says the U.S. government should put a moratorium for several years on any new regulations to limit carbon emissions while it collects data on whether the tax is effective on its own at reducing emissions.

| Jump to first hitNow more than ever, Canadians expect the Government of Canada to take action and promote innovative measures to combat climate change. We know that we can build a Canadian energy sector that is world-leading on environmental measures for today, and innovating for our clean future. Today, we have taken an important step in that direction.Following a thorough and science-based environmental assessment conducted by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada (the Agency) over four years, the Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, has agreed with the conclusions in the Agency's Environmental Assessment Report that determined the proposed Bay du Nord Development Project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects when mitigation measures are taken into account. The project is therefore allowed to proceed with strict measures to protect the environment.Today, a Decision Statement to this effect was issued under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012).The Decision Statement sets out 137 legally-binding conditions that the Norwegian company Equinor (the proponent) must comply with throughout the life of the project, which is approximately 500 kilometres east of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. These conditions include requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and measures to protect fish and fish habitat, migratory birds, species at risk, air quality, human health and Indigenous peoples' use of resources. For the first time ever, a Decision Statement has also been issued requiring the proponent to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.In addition to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, Equinor is also legally-required to consider best available and new technologies to allow for the adaptive management of GHGs, as well as incorporate measures to reduce GHG emissions in the design of the project. The proponent will be responsible for reporting to Environment and Climate Change Canada and to the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) on how these measures will be incorporated into the final project design. At five times less emissions intensive than the average Canadian oil and gas project, and ten times less than the average project in the oil sands, the Bay du Nord Development Project is an example of how Canada can chart a path forward on producing energy at the lowest possible emissions intensity while looking to a net-zero future.The Bay du Nord Development Project fits within the Government's plan to reach an overall 40 percent reduction in emissions compared to 2005 levels by 2030, as laid out in the Emissions Reduction Plan. It also fits within a projected sectoral emissions reduction contribution of a little over 30 percent from 2005 levels from the oil and gas sector, as the Government moves forward on capping and cutting oil and gas sector emissions.As per the Impact Assessment Act, the C-NLOPB will be responsible for enforcing the conditions in the Decision Statement. Failure by the proponent to comply with these conditions is a violation of federal law.Going forward, Equinor can now proceed with obtaining any other necessary authorizations and permits from federal departments as well as the C-NLOPB.This Decision Statement comes after Government of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador announced an intent to expand the mandate of the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador offshore energy regime to include the development of renewable energy such as offshore wind and clean hydrogen.Quotes""The federal government concurs with the recommendation of the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada. As a result, the Bay du Nord Development Project may proceed, subject to some of the strongest environmental conditions ever, including the historic requirement for an oil and gas project to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. The project has undergone a robust federal environmental assessment and scrutiny through every part of Canada's legislated review process. As the demand for oil and gas falls throughout the coming decades, it will be more important than ever that Canadian projects are running at the best-in-class, low-emissions performance to play a competitive role.""- The Honourable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate ChangeQuick facts- Equinor Canada Limited is proposing to develop the Bay du Nord field into an offshore oil production project located in the Flemish Pass, approximately 500 kilometres east of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.- Equinor, the company that will operate the Bay du Nord Development Project, estimates that the project will emit as little as 8kgCO2 per bbl of production, compared to the average oil sands emissions of 80kgCO2/bbl and the overall Canadian average of 40kgCO2/bbl.- According to figures provided by the proponent, the project will contribute an estimated $3.5 billion in government revenue, contribute to research and development, as well as new technology to increase the local supply capacity.- The Bay du Nord Development Project is the first offshore oil and gas production project to complete a federal environmental assessment process under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012). While the project is the first offshore oilfield production project assessed under CEAA 2012, it would be the province's fifth of its kind and a major contributor to the economic development of Newfoundland and Labrador.- The Government of Canada would like to thank all participants for their invaluable comments received throughout the environmental assessment process. Over a hundred comments were submitted and considered, with participants contributing local knowledge and expertise, and working with the Agency to review information, address issues, review potential mitigation measures, and provide input on the project's monitoring and follow-up requirements.- Experts from many federal departments participated in the process by providing robust scientific advice and technical expertise throughout the project's review. These departments include: Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Transport Canada and Health Canada.- Consultations with Indigenous communities throughout the environmental assessment were extensive, with 42 groups participating in the process. A total of $304,154.00 of funding was allocated to support Indigenous participation in the various steps of the review.Source: Government of Canada"

| Jump to first hitThe federal government has approved Equinor ASA's proposal to drill for oil off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, amid calls from Canada's Western allies for help in diminishing Europe's reliance on Russian energy and from environmental groups who say the US$12 billion project should be denied.
""The project is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects,"" Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault said in an announcement made after North American markets closed on Wednesday.
The decision gives Stavanger, Norway-based Equinor and its partners the right to develop the Bay du Nord oilfield, located about 500 kilometres east of St. John's. The project will be Canada's first deepwater drilling site and proposes to use a floating production, storage and off-loading vessel. Cenovus Energy Inc. and BP Plc are partners with Equinor in the project.
Once completed, the vessel will be capable of producing 200,000 barrels per day. There are 300 million recoverable barrels in the area ready to be extracted, according to Equinor. Other estimates have put the recoverable oil two to three times higher. However, it is unlikely to start producing oil until the end of this decade.
The environmental assessment process for the project started in 2018, according to Bloomberg News.
The approval means Bay du Nord is poised to become the first major new Canadian oil production site since Suncor Energy Inc.'s Fort Hills oilsands mine began operation in 2018. The most recent new production platform off the Newfoundland coast was ExxonMobil Corp.'s Hebron project, which started pumping oil in 2017.
Guilbeault's decision will be controversial. The decision disappointed environmental activists, who had fought vehemently against the plan. On March 2, 118 activists and organizations signed a letter addressed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet, calling on them to reject the project.

""The time to stop the expansion of oil and gas production is now,"" the letter said. ""Approving a project that will increase emissions at the exact time when a policy is being created to ensure emissions go down calls into question the stringency, ambition, and effectiveness of the emissions cap - a contradiction to the promise made in Glasgow.""
However, the Russia-Ukraine war complicates the government's efforts to prioritize the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Global fuel shortages continue to increase demand for Canada's large oil reserves, putting pressure on Trudeau to do his part in the Western effort to displace Russian oil and gas.
""The environmental assessment decision announced today is an important milestone for the Bay du Nord development project,"" said Equinor in a statement. ""We now look forward to progressing this key investment in Canada - which has the potential to produce the lowest carbon oil in the country.""
Guilbeault's decision is in line with the Liberal's climate plan, released on March 29 promises to offer, ""lower carbon oil and gas to the world."" The federal energy regulator predicts that Canada is on track to increase oil production by 1.3 million barrels per day by 2030.
Tom Green, senior climate policy adviser at the Suzuki Foundation, an environmental group, said the oil industry got off nearly scot-free in the Liberals'climate plan.
""We would have liked to see more being required of the oil and gas sector, and less reliance on unproven technologies like the carbon capture and storage,"" he said.
Newfoundland's climate plan acknowledged that offshore petroleum projects such as Bay du Nord constituted one of the province's largest sources of emissions. The plan made few provisions for offshore drilling, noting that ""large industry must remain competitive in international markets while reducing their emissions and the offshore petroleum sector has limited scope to reduce their emissions on-site.""
However, the province did ""implement a performance standards system for onshore and offshore industry ... to reduce GHGs while protecting the competitiveness of large industry.""

| Jump to first hitMaersk Supply Service has ordered a new wind turbine installation vessel (WTIV) from a Singapore shipyard after signing a contract to build Empire Offshore Wind off the coast of Long Island, New York, for joint venture owners Equinor and global energy major BP.
Maersk Supply Service, a Denmark-based subsidiary of AP Møller-Maersk and a long-time service provider for the oil and gas industry, did not disclose the cost of the WTIV.
“In signing this contract with Equinor and BP, we are ready to invest in Maersk Supply Service’s first wind turbine installation vessel and firmly establish Maersk Supply Service as an offshore wind contractor,” CEO Steen Karstensen said in a statement. “Offshore wind continues to play an increasingly important role for Maersk Supply Service - both floating wind and bottom-fixed.”
Wind turbines are a stable and increasing source of cargo volumes for the multipurpose/heavy-lift (MPV/HL) sector. According to IHS Markit, total global offshore and onshore wind energy installations will grow by 535 and 1,122 gigawatts (GW), respectively, through 2040.
Click to enlarge.
Empire Wind is one of 14 offshore wind farm projects in various stages of development off the US Atlantic Coast, all part of the Biden administration's offshore wind target of 30 GW by 2030. About 8,435 megawatts (MW) of offshore wind projects were awarded to renewable energy developers in 2021 by states including Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, according to a January report from the Westwood Global Energy Group consultancy.
New York is expected to launch a round of bidding for at least 2 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind projects in 2022, Westwood said. Successful construction of these ambitious projects in the US will require sizable investments in terminals, ports, training, manufacturing facilities, and in ships, including transport, supply, and installation vessels.
The Jones Act factor
There are no Jones Act-compliant WTIVs in existence now, although a first one, the Charybdis, is under construction at the Port of Brownsville, Texas. It was about 50 percent complete as of early March, according to Energy News Network.
Ordered by Virginia-based Dominion Energy, the Charybdis will construct two offshore projects in the US Northeast, Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. It will then be used in the construction of Dominion Energy's 2.6 GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project.
To be Jones Act compliant, vessels must be US-built, owned, and crewed. Non-compliant vessels cannot transport cargo by water between points in the US. The Charybdis will be able to ferry wind components from shore to US offshore construction sites. The new Maersk vessel will not be able to do that, because a vessel constructed in Singapore cannot be Jones Act compliant. However, foreign vessels can remain stationary and operate in US waters as installation vessels.
According to Maersk SS, using a feedering system of tugs and barges to bring turbine components from shore as their new WTIV remains on station during construction will make operations more efficient.
In addition to the new WTIV, two Jones Act-compliant new construction tugs and barges will be built and operated by Kirby Offshore Wind under a partnership with Maersk Supply Service, the Danish company said. Kirby is a subsidiary of Kirby Corp., one of the US’ largest operators of offshore barges and tugs. The barges and diesel-electric hybrid tugboats are expected to cost between $80 million and $100 million, according to Workboat.

To the Editor: I am always somewhat astounded that America doesn't look to Canada for long-term energy security ("" Putin's Lonely War Is Just the Beginning ,"" Cover Story, March 11). Why go cap in hand to Middle Eastern despots and make some devil's bargain? America could simply ask Canada to provide additional oil, natural gas, and hydroelectric energy, of which it has an abundance. It would be so much easier to manage the transition to renewable energy when you are working with a partner that has similar interests, goals, and values.

Rosie, the Patriotic Fracker
To the Editor: As an early player in the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, industry, I can tell you that additional oil and gas capacity has already been activated and brought online. Yes, pipelines and transport availability are an issue and are being addressed, even as the current administration continues to throw roadblocks in the way. We need to applaud Rosie, the patriotic fracker, rather than punish her for straining to make a reasonable profit.

Equinor's Yield
To the Editor: The feature by Andrew Bary on Norwegian state-controlled energy giant Equinor highlights the nearly 5% yield ("" This Is the Stock to Play the Surge in European Natural-Gas Prices ,"" March 11). However, he neglects to point out the American depositary receipt fees and foreign taxes that reduce the yield for American investors. These costs would be applicable for both the base dividend, as well as any special dividends.

Barron's Basics CPI
To the Editor: Lisa Beilfuss' column on inflation is right on point ("" Here's Why It's Time to Focus on the Inflation Economists Ignore ,"" The Economy, March 11). It never made sense to me that economists consider the consumer price index excluding food and energy. They're the two commodities that all consumers buy, and frequently, so they affect everyone's pocketbook and probably drive future expectations about inflation. Her so-called Barron's Basics CPI is a very valuable tool in analyzing the true rate of inflation. The fact that it was 16% in February is frightening and, if left unchecked, will probably lead to a recession, if not civil unrest.
Robert M. Sussman, Paradise Valley, Ariz.
To the Editor: Since we now have food inflation and many other commodities in an inflationary spiral not seen since the 1970s, perhaps we should look at interest rates from that period to inform our decision about how high rates need to go in order to bring inflation under control. Starting with the Vietnam War era in 1968 and continuing through 1990, it took 22 years before inflation consistently fell below 3% and federal funds retreated from a high of 18% in 1980 to 4% in 1991.
It's way past time for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to take off the rose-colored glasses and get serious about fighting the inflationary quicksand beneath his feet that is rapidly eroding the purchasing power of the American people.

Buy Amazon and Reap
To the Editor: In "" Stock Splits Shouldn't Matter. Investors Love Them Anyway "" (Follow Up, March 11), Eric J. Savitz cites the old trope that a split doesn't increase the value of the investment, which is true. But the real value of the Amazon.com split is that it has more than 300 million active customers, with 90 million Prime members in the U.S. alone. So, the true value of the split is that, for the first time, these users will be able to afford to buy whole shares of the stock.
There are a few headwinds: Amazon employees will find it easier to unload stock as the price goes up, and large investors may decide to take profits. For these reasons, it is necessary to have an investment horizon of two to five years. Amazon is trading at $2,911 as I write this. Don't wait till the June 6, 2022, split-adjusted trading date. This is the closest thing to getting in on an ""initial public offering"" that a small investor is going to get. Buy it and reap.

To the Editor: The interview with Carbon Direct's Nili Gilbert ("" This Investor Is Fighting Climate Change by Nudging Portfolios to Net-Zero Carbon ,"" March 11) touched on only a few items that may help educate readers on the issue. A Wall Street Journal review of the Deloitte Report on climate and the economy stated that, among other things, ""inaction on climate change could cost the U.S. economy $14.5 trillion by 2070."" On the positive side, the report makes the case for an industrial revolution that is built on low emissions and decarbonization. It concludes that by 2048 the U.S. could see $3 trillion of growth in the economy.
My own conclusion is that we need to create an economic atmosphere that will accelerate investment in clean energy. This will take education and some effort from the U.S. Congress.

Equinor is one of the best-kept secrets in the oil-and-gas industry.
The Norwegian state-controlled company is the second-largest provider of natural gas to Europe behind Gazprom (ticker: GAZP.Russia). Equinor has been realizing a financial windfall from an extraordinary surge in European gas prices, to roughly $40 for a thousand cubic feet—almost 10 times the American benchmark, and equivalent to an oil price of $240 a barrel.
The company's U.S.-listed shares (EQNR), now trading around $33, look appealing at 8.6 times projected 2022 earnings of $3.88 a share. The stock carries a nearly 5% dividend yield. This reflects a base quarterly payout of 20 cents a share and special dividends of 20 cents a share quarterly that Equinor plans to pay this year.
Equinor also plans to buy back $5 billion of stock in 2022, resulting in a total yield (dividend plus repurchases) of close to 10%—one of the highest among major energy producers.
No Western energy company has greater exposure to European gas, which may be the single best energy market in the world now. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor provides about 20% of the Continent's gas.
Equinor may also be the greenest of the top global energy companies, with a carbon footprint per barrel of oil and gas produced that is less than half the industry average. It stacks up well against its peers in offshore wind power generation and carbon capture, with unmatched technological expertise.
""Equinor is the leading offshore operator in the world for both oil and gas and renewables,"" says Antonio De Pinho, a senior resource analyst at VanEck, which holds Equinor stock.
Decades of work developing oil and gas fields in the harsh waters off the Norwegian coast has burnished Equinor's offshore drilling ability. It operates an extensive network of underwater pipes totaling more than 7,000 miles to bring gas onshore and then pump it through pipelines to Europe.
The company has used its Norwegian offshore experience to develop fields offshore in countries like Brazil.
The company's technical prowess was apparent in the fourth quarter, when it increased its offshore gas production 16% to alleviate a European shortage and capitalize on high prices.
Europe needs gas and has limited options. As a result, it has continued to buy gas from Russia, which provides about 40% of the Continent's supply.
Yet most European countries want to reduce their exposure to Russian gas in the coming years, which should benefit Equinor.

 Commodities & Futures 
Equinor produces more than two million barrels a day of oil and its equivalent, split evenly between oil and gas. Two-thirds comes from the company's prolific Norwegian offshore fields. European gas is about a third of its total output, and most of it is sold on the spot market and thus benefits from current high prices.
""This winter, the energy realities in Europe have demonstrated the importance of stable and reliable deliveries of gas from Norway,"" said Anders Opedal, Equinor's CEO, on the company's earnings call in February. ""Currently, we see low inventories, low spare capacity, and too-low energy investments over time.""
Company executives declined to speak to Barron's.
The biggest risk with Equinor would be a collapse in European gas prices. Its stock, however, already discounts some potential decline, given a free-cash-flow yield of about 20%, assuming oil at $100 a barrel and gas at $20—half the current price. Assume gas at $10 per thousand cubic feet and the free-cash-flow yield is about 10%.
""We believe that European gas prices could stay higher for longer, as there is no easy way for the market to normalize until later this decade,"" wrote HSBC analyst Kim Fustier in a client note last month.
Equinor, which is 67% owned by the Norwegian government, has a market value of $110 billion, more than BP (BP). With no net debt, Equinor also has one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies.
Its base dividend is low relative to peers, and the company plans to increase it gradually in the coming years. Special dividends could become the norm, given its healthy balance sheet.
An environmentally conscious Norway levies a high tax of 78% on Equinor's domestic profit. Yet with a low cost of about $2 per thousand cubic feet for gas, the company's after-tax earnings are still healthy.
The company has one of the larger wind portfolios among European energy companies. It plans to have 12 to 16 gigawatts of renewable power generation—mostly wind—in place by 2030. That's enough to power about 10 million homes.
Equinor's distinctive skills are evident in its use of electricity—using power delivered by cables from onshore hydroelectric plants—to run offshore rigs in two fields. This results in one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world. Most offshore platforms globally are powered by diesel generators or natural gas.
And the company is years ahead of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) in carbon capture, says VanEck's De Pinho.
Equinor's Northern Lights project, in conjunction with Europe's TotalEnergies (TTE) and Shell (SHEL), is due to start operations in 2024. It will take carbon emissions, pipe them offshore from Norway, and bury them about one-and-a-half miles beneath the Atlantic Ocean, with the capacity to store 15 million to 30 million tons of carbon annually by 2035.
While Equinor emphasizes its green initiatives, it's not losing sight of its core business. Oil and gas production is expected to grow 2% this year and at a similar pace through 2026.
The Norwegian continental shelf remains a prolific energy source. The company's big Troll offshore field has been operating for 25 years and has another 25-plus years of estimated reserve life.
With its pole position in the European natural-gas market and a low carbon footprint, Equinor is well suited to both energy-focused and eco-conscious investors.
Equinor aims to have 12 to 16 gigawatts of renewable power installed by 2030. An earlier version of this article misstated the renewables goal as 12 to 16 megawatts.

Equinor produces more than two million barrels a day of oil and its equivalent, split evenly between oil and gas. Two-thirds comes from the company's prolific Norwegian offshore fields. European gas is about a third of its total output, and most of it is sold on the spot market and thus benefits from current high prices.
""This winter, the energy realities in Europe have demonstrated the importance of stable and reliable deliveries of gas from Norway,"" said Anders Opedal, Equinor's CEO, on the company's earnings call in February. ""Currently, we see low inventories, low spare capacity, and too-low energy investments over time.""
Company executives declined to speak to Barron's.
The biggest risk with Equinor would be a collapse in European gas prices. Its stock, however, already discounts some potential decline, given a free-cash-flow yield of about 20%, assuming oil at $100 a barrel and gas at $20—half the current price. Assume gas at $10 per thousand cubic feet and the free-cash-flow yield is about 10%.
""We believe that European gas prices could stay higher for longer, as there is no easy way for the market to normalize until later this decade,"" wrote HSBC analyst Kim Fustier in a client note last month.
Equinor, which is 67% owned by the Norwegian government, has a market value of $110 billion, more than BP (BP). With no net debt, Equinor also has one of the best balance sheets among major energy companies.
Its base dividend is low relative to peers, and the company plans to increase it gradually in the coming years. Special dividends could become the norm, given its healthy balance sheet.
An environmentally conscious Norway levies a high tax of 78% on Equinor's domestic profit. Yet with a low cost of about $2 per thousand cubic feet for gas, the company's after-tax earnings are still healthy.
The company has one of the larger wind portfolios among European energy companies. It plans to have 12 to 16 megawatts of renewable power generation—mostly wind—in place by 2030. That's enough to power about 10 million homes.
Equinor's distinctive skills are evident in its use of electricity—using power delivered by cables from onshore hydroelectric plants—to run offshore rigs in two fields. This results in one of the lowest carbon footprints in the world. Most offshore platforms globally are powered by diesel generators or natural gas.
And the company is years ahead of Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) in carbon capture, says VanEck's De Pinho.
Equinor's Northern Lights project, in conjunction with Europe's TotalEnergies (TTE) and Shell (SHEL), is due to start operations in 2024. It will take carbon emissions, pipe them offshore from Norway, and bury them about one-and-a-half miles beneath the Atlantic Ocean, with the capacity to store 15 million to 30 million tons of carbon annually by 2035.
While Equinor emphasizes its green initiatives, it's not losing sight of its core business. Oil and gas production is expected to grow 2% this year and at a similar pace through 2026.
The Norwegian continental shelf remains a prolific energy source. The company's big Troll offshore field has been operating for 25 years and has another 25-plus years of estimated reserve life.
With its pole position in the European natural-gas market and a low carbon footprint, Equinor is well suited to both energy-focused and eco-conscious investors.

| Jump to first hitIn response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, British energy giant BP announced on Feb. 27, 2022, that it will sell its nearly 20% ownership in Russian state-owned energy giant Rosneft. BP’s rival Shell is also pulling out of all of its operations in Russia, as are U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil and Norway’s state-controlled company, Equinor.
These breakups will not be cheap. BP’s stake in Rosneft is worth US$14 billion. In various projects, Shell has about $3 billion in assets in Russia. ExxonMobil has over 1,000 employees and more than $4 billion in assets there. Pulling out will inflict significant financial hits on all of these companies.
Western energy companies have invested and operated in Russia for a long time – over 30 years for BP and more than 25 years for ExxonMobil. They are accustomed to managing international political risks.
In my view, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has completely changed Western energy companies’ cost-benefit analysis of doing business in Russia. I have researched multinational companies’ foreign direct investments in emerging markets for over two decades and have closely followed Western energy companies’ investments in Russia. I expect that other Western oil majors, such as French company TotalEnergies, are also likely to pull out of Russia, and that it may take many years for these companies to reengage there.
Big risks, big payoffs
Foreign investment in Russia has never been easy. For example, in 2003, BP and a consortium of Russian oligarchs formed the joint venture TNK-BP, which became one of the largest oil producers in Russia. However, disputes ensued over the venture’s leadership, operations and international expansion.
The situation became so fraught that Bob Dudley, then the head of TNK-BP and later BP’s chief executive officer, was forced to flee from Russia in 2008. To resolve the disputes, BP sold its 50% equity in TNK-BP to Rosneft in 2013 for $12.5 billion in cash and a nearly 20% share in Rosneft.
Shell got involved in the early 1990s in the Sakhalin-2 project to develop natural gas reserves in Russia’s Far East, and built Russia’s first liquefied natural gas facility there. As the project neared completion in 2006, at a cost of more than $20 billion, Shell and its Japanese partners were forced to sell a 50% share to Russia’s state-owned natural gas giant, Gazprom, for $7.45 billion because Putin’s government was unhappy with the easy terms previously offered by the Yeltsin administration.
During crises like these, Western energy companies weighed the potential gains and costs of operating in Russia and concluded that staying in was worth it. It’s easy to see why: Russia holds 24% of the world’s total natural gas reserves. It has comprehensive pipeline networks to the west to move natural gas to European countries, and large reserves to its east that are close to some of the world’s hungriest energy markets, including Japan, South Korea and China.
For years, Western energy companies viewed compromise with the Russian government as part of the cost of doing business there. As long as expected gains exceeded costs, they stayed.
Reputations matter
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has changed those calculations. Now, executives at oil majors need to assess possible broader damage to their corporate reputations and to relationships with their home country governments, shareholders and other interest groups if they stay in Russia. Unlike controversies within the energy industry, invading an independent sovereign nation is much too high profile of a development for companies to ignore.
Academic research shows that there is a positive correlation between companies’ socially responsible behaviors and financial performance. Simply put, companies that do good tend to do well financially. The invasion of Ukraine represents a critical shift in Russia’s business environment. As BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney stated on Feb. 26, the situation unfolding in Ukraine “has caused us to fundamentally rethink BP’s position with Rosneft.”
In particular, Western energy companies that partner with the Russian government now may be perceived as weakening their own governments’ sanctions and helping to finance Russia’s war in Ukraine. Russia owns 40% of BP’s Russian partner, Rosneft; the company’s CEO and board chair, Igor Sechin, is Russia’s former deputy prime minister and a close Putin ally. Shell’s primary partner in Russia is Gazprom, the state-run natural gas giant.
To maintain their corporate reputations and relationships with key interest groups, BP, Shell, Equinor and ExxonMobil clearly have decided that it is important to cut their ties in Russia completely, immediately and publicly. BP’s current and former chief executive officers resigned from Rosneft’s board of directors on Feb. 27, three days after the invasion began, “with immediate effect.”
While the Western world is imposing severe and united sanctions on Russia in sectors ranging from finance to aviation, Western governments have avoided sanctioning energy exports from Russia, seeking to protect their citizens from price spikes. Nonetheless, if Western energy companies remain in Russia and continue partnering with Russian state-owned companies, they could be perceived as undermining the Western response. Indeed, BP’s exit decision reportedly came under pressure from the British government.
None of these companies have many viable potential buyers for their Russian holdings. Russian firms, facing sanctions, don’t have the resources to acquire foreign investors’ assets, and other Western energy companies are unlikely to pursue them. The only potential investors are private equity firms that face less scrutiny than publicly traded companies, or companies from countries that don’t join Western sanctions on Russia.
Russia’s energy sector depends heavily upon Western companies’ technologies, especially for hard-to-recover oil projects and offshore projects. BP, Shell and ExxonMobil will leave significant technological voids that could be hard for newcomers to fill.
Corporate leaders are used to making high-level strategic decisions that require weighing costs and benefits. What has changed the calculus for Western energy companies is the broad potential damage to their companies’ reputations and relationships with various interest groups if they stay in Russia. Clearly, executives cannot limit benefit-cost calculations to specific investments. Their overall corporate reputations can be worth billions of dollars.

Selling out of Russia isn't as painful for Western oil and gas supermajors as the scale of their write-downs would suggest. But it will further diminish their global relevance relative to the real giants of the fossil-fuel industry today: state-controlled national oil companies.
As the global response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine has escalated, independent oil and gas companies have headed for the exit. Exxon Mobil became the latest shoe to drop late Tuesday, following BP, Equinor and Shell. Given a dearth of buyers and the complexity of selling within a web of sanctions, they will likely have to impair or even write off a combined $22 billion of assets.
The lion's share of that is BP's 19.75% stake in Rosneft, with a book value of $14 billion. It represented about half of the British company's booked oil and gas reserves and a third of its oil production, but only about 3% of its cash flow over the past four years. Exxon Mobil has $4 billion in Russian assets, mostly in an oil and gas facility it operates on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East.
Shell's $3 billion includes joint ventures with gas-export-giant Gazprom and a stake in its mothballedNord Stream 2 pipeline. Equinor had $1.2 billion in Russian joint ventures with Rosneft. French supermajor TotalEnergies had said it wouldn't invest in new Russian projects but didn't mention selling existing assets. It is now under political pressure at home to do more.
Investors seem relatively sanguine. BP's stock is down just 1.4% this week, representing a little over $1 billion in market value. One reason is the natural hedge of rising oil and gas prices. Even though the sanctions regimes so far exclude key commodities, they do touch some banks involved in the trade. The market is shunning Russian oil while awaiting more information, driving crude prices well over $100 a barrel.
Also, exiting Rosneft's Arctic drilling programs removes an awkward stain on BP's green-transition story. And investors likely discounted the holdings for local political risk and the possibility that the assets might never pay back.
Meanwhile, state-run oil and gas companies seem to be proceeding with business as usual. A no-drama meeting is expected when the Organization of Petroleum Producing Countries and friends, including Russia, meet today to discuss production quotas. The Western divestments are therefore likely to speed up an existing trend: the shift from independent producers to OPEC states as decarbonization picks up pace.
Russian and Middle Eastern companies are spending more on drilling and exploration than they were before the pandemic. Independent supermajors are generally not: They face demands for capital discipline in the U.S. and for a strategic shift toward low-emission energy in Europe. State-run producers are largely insulated from those pressures. Instead, most of them must contend with their political masters' demands to exploit natural resources to meet national energy, employment and state-revenue requirements.
As independent supermajors plot a path into the growing clean-energy market, they are ceding share to national oil companies in the fossil-fuel market, which is expected to eventually shrink. The pace of the shift to low-emission energy is the subject of great debate. In oil and gas production, though, the shift from independent to national companies is only getting faster.

Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has forced the biggest reappraisal of corporate relations with Russia for a generation, leaving oil executives and commodity traders with a choice between clinging on to lucrative commercial ventures and heeding calls for divestment.
Russia is the third-largest oil producer, the biggest exporter of gas, and for most of the past decade was viewed as the most promising exploration and development destination.
Western sanctions have sought to avoid restricting oil and gas exports, and some of the companies say they can continue to operate in the country.
But decisions by BP, Shell and Norway's Equinor to cut ties with their Russian partners have increased the pressure on the likes of TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Trafigura and Glencore to do the same.
""Other oil and gas companies must now follow suit,"" said Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow energy secretary. ""It cannot be right that oil and gas companies continue to provide substantial investments into Russia after the unprovoked and outrageous invasion of Ukraine.""
Christyan Malek, head of global energy strategy at JPMorgan, said BP's divestment pledge ""should put the rest of the industry's feet on the fire"".
While commodity groups had always operated in difficult parts of the world, even during periods of war, the pressure on companies today to adhere to higher environmental, social and governance standards meant this was ""uncharted territory"", he said.
""How do you advance a credible ESG agenda when you're in a country that's in a major conflict?""
Of the oil majors still operating in Russia, Total had the most commercial exposure now BP had decided to dump its 19.75 per cent stake in Rosneft and
Shell was moving to end its partnerships with Gazprom, analysts said.
The French group has invested heavily in two projects in the Yamal peninsula in Russia's frozen north, as it seeks to build out its liquefied natural gas business alongside local ""strategic partner"" Novatek. Total owns 19.4 per cent of the Russian company, which has been under US sanctions limiting its access to finance since 2014 when Putin annexed Crimea. Total also has a 20 per cent and 10 per cent stake in two Novatek LNG projects.
Russia last year delivered 16 per cent of Total's oil and gas production, according to investment bank Jefferies, and cash of $1.5bn.
Shell's Russian production represented 5 per cent of its total last year, Jefferies said. Russian expansion had previously been a priority for Shell's management, according to a person familiar with Shell's strategy.
Shell owns 27.5 per cent of Gazprom's Sakhalin-2 offshore LNG project in Russia's far east. Inaugurated in 2009, it produced roughly 11.6mn tonnes of LNG in 2020, of which 3.2mn tonnes will have flowed to Shell, representing about 10 per cent the company's production. Its withdrawal from the project could leave Shell short of LNG in east Asia at a time when prices for cargoes of the fuel are high and expected to keep rising.
The UK-listed oil major, one of five international energy groups that each committed to fund 10 per cent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, is also pulling out of that project. Last week Berlin said it was halting certification of the pipeline indefinitely and the US placed sanctions on the Gazprom subsidiary building it.
Shell's Russia business has long been contentious among some staff, not least because four Shell employees were among those killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.
Exxon has been operating in Russia for 25 years and employs more than 1,000 people in the country. In 2018 it withdrew from a series of joint ventures with Rosneft after the US expanded sanctions originally placed on the Russian company in 2014.
Exxon has continued to operate the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in partnership with two Rosneft units and companies from India and Japan. Exxon owns 30 per cent of the project, which has exported more than 985 mn barrels of oil and 29bn cubic metres of natural gas since production began in 2005.
Total and Exxon did not respond to requests for comment.
George Voloshin, a Russia expert with Aperio, said he expected more divestments. ""There will be a domino effect spreading well beyond the energy sector and extending to a wide variety of joint ventures and affiliates."" At least one oilfield services company was reviewing its Russian projects, he said.
Commodity traders are exposed. Swiss trading house Trafigura has built a strong relationship with Rosneft since helping it raise funds through shortterm prepayment deals that were still permitted after the 2014 sanctions were introduced.
It strengthened that relationship in December 2020 when it agreed to buy 10 per cent of the €7.3bn Rosneft-led Vostok Oil project in the Arctic, in a deal that will also give Trafigura long-term access to cheap Russian crude. If all goes to plan, Vostok will develop a new oilproducing region on Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula to rival the US Permian Basin and Saudi Arabia's Ghawar oilfield. A consortium led by Vitol, the biggest independent oil trader, is also set to take a 5 per cent stake in the project.
Trafigura declined to comment. Vitol could not be immediately reached for comment.
People with knowledge of its thinking said Trafigura had no plans to sell its stake in Vostok. They described the investment as a ""small, minority interest"" in a project that will not start producing oil until 2024.
Trafigura and other traders had continued to lift Russian crude and were expected to continue to do so unless it was explicitly banned by western governments, bankers said.
While UK politicians have criticised the likes of BP and Shell for their Russian relations, sanctions have intentionally avoided blocking energy exports in a sign that western leaders remain willing to buy Russian oil and gas, even if some say they do not want western companies involved in its production.
London-listed Glencore owns a 0.5 per cent stake in Rosneft, worth $195mn as at Friday's close, plus 25 per cent in Russneft, which it is poised to sell. It has a 10.5 per cent stake in En+, the metals group that has a controlling stake in aluminium producer Rusal.
""The combined $920mn market value of these stakes is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of Glencore's $77bn market capitalisation,"" said JPMorgan analyst Dominic O'Kane. ""In addition, Glencore's marketing relationship and offtake contracts with various Russian commodity producers will be under scrutiny, including Rusal and Rosneft.""
Glencore declined to comment.
If more groups run for the exit, finding buyers for unwanted minority stakes in Russian assets will be hard. Some analysts have speculated that potential bidders could include Chinese or Middle Eastern groups such as the Qatar Investment Authority, which already owns 18 per cent of Rosneft. But any deal would be difficult to get over the line and come at a huge discount.
BP's decision to reclassify the investment and take a paper loss without triggering a fire sale or immediately writing down the stake to zero made a lot of sense, Aperio's Voloshin said. ""It's absolutely the worst time to sell.""

Norwegian oil group Equinor and Germany's Daimler Truck are ending their partnerships with Russian businesses while Volvo said it was halting deliveries of cars to Russia as the corporate fallout from the invasion of Ukraine spreads.
The announcements came as multinational groups with operations in Russia grappled with the reputational impact of their association with the country as well as potential exposure to western sanctions designed to inflict severe economic pain.
They follow BP's announcement on Sunday that it was divesting its near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil group Rosneft, with chair Helge Lund describing Moscow's invasion of Ukraine as an ""act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region"".
Companies with staff in Russia are also considering whether to repatriate families, people close to two French groups with operations there said. Equinor said yesterday it was ""exiting"" joint ventures in Russia that also include a strategic partnership with Rosneft encompassing projects in Siberia.
""In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,"" said Anders Opedal, chief executive."" He said that Equinor, which is two-thirds owned by the Norwegian government, was ""deeply troubled"" by Russia's invasion.
Daimler Truck, the world's largest truckmaker, said that it had taken the decision to ""immediately suspend all our business activities in Russia"" even though its contract with local vehiclemaker Kamaz limits co-operation to manufacturing civilian vehicles.
Kamaz, which was established under the Soviet Union, separately makes utility vehicles for Russia's armed forces.
Volvo Cars specifically cited the impact of the west's financial penalties as it said that it would ""not deliver any cars to the Russian market until further notice"" because of ""potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and US"".
Truckmaker Volvo, which is independent of the car company, said yesterday that it had halted production at its factory in Russia and stopped sales to the country until further notice, citing the risk of sanctions.
Following warnings from other carmakers that they could struggle to transport components into and out of Russia, Renault said that it had temporarily closed its Moscow plant, which produces models such as the Renault Captur and its Arkana SUVs, because of supply-chain problems. Another of the French group's factories operated by its Russian Avtovaz unit also halted production yesterday, but that was because of semiconductor shortages, it said.
Russia is the Renault group's secondbiggest market by sales volumes, while Avtovaz last year made up about 7 per cent of its overall revenues.
Many of the western firms employ largely local staff through their Russian subsidiaries. Major employers also include retailers such as Germany's Metro AG or France's Auchan.

Kamaz, which was established under the Soviet Union, separately makes utility vehicles for Russia's armed forces.
Volvo Cars specifically cited the impact of the west's financial penalties as it said that it would ""not deliver any cars to the Russian market until further notice"" because of ""potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and US"".
Truckmaker Volvo, which is independent of the car company, said yesterday that it had halted production at its factory in Russia and stopped sales to the country until further notice, citing the risk of sanctions.
Following warnings from other carmakers that they could struggle to transport components into and out of Russia, Renault said that it had temporarily closed its Moscow plant, which produces models such as the Renault Captur and its Arkana SUVs, because of supply-chain problems. Another of the French group's factories operated by its Russian Avtovaz unit also halted production yesterday, but that was because of semiconductor shortages, it said.
Russia is the Renault group's secondbiggest market by sales volumes, while Avtovaz last year made up about 7 per cent of its overall revenues.
Many of the western firms employ largely local staff through their Russian subsidiaries. Major employers also include retailers such as Germany's Metro AG or France's Auchan.

Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has forced the biggest reappraisal of corporate relations with Russia for a generation, leaving oil executives and commodity traders with a choice between clinging on to lucrative commercial ventures and heeding calls for divestment.
Russia is the third-largest oil producer, the biggest exporter of gas, and for most of the past decade was viewed as the most promising exploration and development destination.
Western sanctions have sought to avoid restricting oil and gas exports, and some of the companies say they can continue to operate in the country.
But decisions by BP, Shell and Norway's Equinor to cut ties with their Russian partners have increased the pressure on the likes of TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Trafigura and Glencore to do the same.
""Other oil and gas companies must now follow suit,"" said Ed Miliband, the UK's shadow energy secretary. ""It cannot be right that oil and gas companies continue to provide substantial investments into Russia after the unprovoked and outrageous invasion of Ukraine.""
Christyan Malek, head of global energy strategy at JPMorgan, said BP's divestment pledge ""should put the rest of the industry's feet on the fire"".
While commodity groups had always operated in difficult parts of the world, even during periods of war, the pressure on companies today to adhere to higher environmental, social and governance standards meant this was ""uncharted territory"", he said.
""How do you advance a credible ESG agenda when you're in a country that's in a major conflict?""
Of the oil majors still operating in Russia, Total had the most commercial exposure now BP had decided to dump its 19.75 per cent stake in Rosneft and
Shell was moving to end its partnerships with Gazprom, analysts said.
The French group has invested heavily in two projects in the Yamal peninsula in Russia's frozen north, as it seeks to build out its liquefied natural gas business alongside local ""strategic partner"" Novatek. Total owns 19.4 per cent of the Russian company, which has been under US sanctions limiting its access to finance since 2014 when Putin annexed Crimea. Total also has a 20 per cent and 10 per cent stake in two Novatek LNG projects.
Russia last year delivered 16 per cent of Total's oil and gas production, according to investment bank Jefferies, and cash of $1.5bn.
Shell's Russian production represented 5 per cent of its total last year, Jefferies said. Russian expansion had previously been a priority for Shell's management, according to a person familiar with Shell's strategy.
Shell owns 27.5 per cent of Gazprom's Sakhalin-2 offshore LNG project in Russia's far east. Inaugurated in 2009, it produced roughly 11.6mn tonnes of LNG in 2020, of which 3.2mn tonnes will have flowed to Shell, representing about 10 per cent the company's production. Its withdrawal from the project could leave Shell short of LNG in east Asia at a time when prices for cargoes of the fuel are high and expected to keep rising.
The UK-listed oil major, one of five international energy groups that each committed to fund 10 per cent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline between Russia and Germany, is also pulling out of that project. Last week Berlin said it was halting certification of the pipeline indefinitely and the US placed sanctions on the Gazprom subsidiary building it.
Shell's Russia business has long been contentious among some staff, not least because four Shell employees were among those killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in 2014.
Exxon has been operating in Russia for 25 years and employs more than 1,000 people in the country. In 2018 it withdrew from a series of joint ventures with Rosneft after the US expanded sanctions originally placed on the Russian company in 2014.
Exxon has continued to operate the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in partnership with two Rosneft units and companies from India and Japan. Exxon owns 30 per cent of the project, which has exported more than 985 mn barrels of oil and 29bn cubic metres of natural gas since production began in 2005.
Total and Exxon did not respond to requests for comment.
George Voloshin, a Russia expert with Aperio, said he expected more divestments. ""There will be a domino effect spreading well beyond the energy sector and extending to a wide variety of joint ventures and affiliates."" At least one oilfield services company was reviewing its Russian projects, he said.
Commodity traders are exposed. Swiss trading house Trafigura has built a strong relationship with Rosneft since helping it raise funds through shortterm prepayment deals that were still permitted after the 2014 sanctions were introduced.
It strengthened that relationship in December 2020 when it agreed to buy 10 per cent of the €7.3bn Rosneft-led Vostok Oil project in the Arctic, in a deal that will also give Trafigura long-term access to cheap Russian crude. If all goes to plan, Vostok will develop a new oilproducing region on Siberia's Taymyr Peninsula to rival the US Permian Basin and Saudi Arabia's Ghawar oilfield. A consortium led by Vitol, the biggest independent oil trader, is also set to take a 5 per cent stake in the project.
Trafigura declined to comment. Vitol could not be immediately reached for comment.
People with knowledge of its thinking said Trafigura had no plans to sell its stake in Vostok. They described the investment as a ""small, minority interest"" in a project that will not start producing oil until 2024.
Trafigura and other traders had continued to lift Russian crude and were expected to continue to do so unless it was explicitly banned by western governments, bankers said.
While UK politicians have criticised the likes of BP and Shell for their Russian relations, sanctions have intentionally avoided blocking energy exports in a sign that western leaders remain willing to buy Russian oil and gas, even if some say they do not want western companies involved in its production.
London-listed Glencore owns a 0.5 per cent stake in Rosneft, worth $195mn as at Friday's close, plus 25 per cent in Russneft, which it is poised to sell. It has a 10.5 per cent stake in En+, the metals group that has a controlling stake in aluminium producer Rusal.
""The combined $920mn market value of these stakes is equivalent to 1.2 per cent of Glencore's $77bn market capitalisation,"" said JPMorgan analyst Dominic O'Kane. ""In addition, Glencore's marketing relationship and offtake contracts with various Russian commodity producers will be under scrutiny, including Rusal and Rosneft.""
Glencore declined to comment.
If more groups run for the exit, finding buyers for unwanted minority stakes in Russian assets will be hard. Some analysts have speculated that potential bidders could include Chinese or Middle Eastern groups such as the Qatar Investment Authority, which already owns 18 per cent of Rosneft. But any deal would be difficult to get over the line and come at a huge discount.
BP's decision to reclassify the investment and take a paper loss without triggering a fire sale or immediately writing down the stake to zero made a lot of sense, Aperio's Voloshin said. ""It's absolutely the worst time to sell.""

Norwegian oil group Equinor and Germany's Daimler Truck are ending their partnerships with Russian businesses while Volvo said it was halting deliveries of cars to Russia as the corporate fallout from the invasion of Ukraine spreads.
The announcements came as multinational groups with operations in Russia grappled with the reputational impact of their association with the country as well as potential exposure to western sanctions designed to inflict severe economic pain.
They follow BP's announcement on Sunday that it was divesting its near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil group Rosneft, with chair Helge Lund describing Moscow's invasion of Ukraine as an ""act of aggression which is having tragic consequences across the region"".
Companies with staff in Russia are also considering whether to repatriate families, people close to two French groups with operations there said. Equinor said yesterday it was ""exiting"" joint ventures in Russia that also include a strategic partnership with Rosneft encompassing projects in Siberia.
""In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,"" said Anders Opedal, chief executive."" He said that Equinor, which is two-thirds owned by the Norwegian government, was ""deeply troubled"" by Russia's invasion.

Western companies are reassessing their businesses in Russia, with some quitting the country and others suspending their operations there as sanctions intensify in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
TotalEnergies on Tuesday said it will no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia and will implement any European sanctions ""regardless of the consequences"" on its Russian activities. But the French oil major, which owns a 19.4% stake in Russian natural-gas producer Novatek, stopped short of joining its rivals in cutting ties with the country.
Shell (ticker: SHEL) said on Monday that it will end all of its joint ventures with the Kremlin-controlled energy company Gazprom (OGZPY), ditching stakes in three major gas projects and the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project. Shell's Russian assets were valued at $3 billion at the end of last year.
The decision came after BP said on Sunday that it will offload its 19.75% stake in Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft (ROSN) following Russia's ""act of aggression in Ukraine."" Norwegian government-controlled oil group Equinor (EQNR), which has been operating in Russia for 30 years, said its position in Russia has become ""untenable"" and said it would stop new investments into the country and start the process of exiting its joint ventures there.
Meanwhile, Norway's government ordered its $1.3 trillion oil fund, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, to divest its $3 billion in Russian investments.
Several automakers have also moved to halt some business in Russia. Daimler Truck said it would freeze its business activities in the country with immediate effect and may review ties with local joint-venture partner Kamaz PJSC. Volvo Car AB said it would stop delivering cars to Russia until further notice.
""The corporate world is building up a fortress to isolate Russia from the international community,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at British retail stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown, adding that more companies are expected to follow suit.
The retrenchment by Western companies reverses almost three decades of engagement with Russia and comes as sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's financial system intensify. The U.S. and its allies over the weekend agreed to exclude a number of Russian banks from Swift , an international messaging system used by financial institutions.

Mastercard(MA) said on Monday it has blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from its payment network and would continue to work with regulators to comply with sanctions. Visa (V) followed suit on Tuesday, saying it was taking prompt action to ensure compliance with sanctions, adding that it will donate $2 million for humanitarian aid.
Elsewhere, Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S , (MAERSK.B.Denmark) said it was considering a possible suspension of all deliveries to and from Russia to comply with sanctions. Maersk said it would do its utmost to ensure cargo already on the water reaches its destination. ""It's also worth noting that airspace is also gradually being restricted and our air services will be impacted,"" the company said in a statement .
Tech firms moved to try and curb the spread of Russian disinformation campaigns that try to manipulate narratives about Ukraine.
Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL) Google said Tuesday it had blocked content from Russian state-backed media on its YouTube platforms in Europe, effective immediately. ""It'll take time for our systems to fully ramp up. Our teams continue to monitor the situation around the clock to take swift action,"" the tech giant said in a tweet.
It followed a similar move by Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms (FB), which said it had restricted access to Russian state media within the EU. The social media giant has received requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state-controlled media on its platforms, its head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said in a tweet late Monday.

| Jump to first hitWhile Russia is invading Ukraine, the number of international companies exiting Russia has been on the rise.  As Russia faces severe sanctions imposed by western governments, countries closing their airspace to its aircrafts and lock some of its banks out of the SWIFT money messaging system, many multinational companies from different sectors decided that it's too risky to remain operating in Russia not only for financial reasons, but for reputational ones too. And here are the list of companies who have announced their stand against Russia so far: 1. BP Plc. London-based oil giant, BP Plc, announced that it will sell its $14 billion (19.75% voting stake) stake in Russian state oil firm Rosneft after facing pressure from the UK government. It is unclear who BP would sell it to. 2. Shell Plc. The British multinational oil and gas company, Shell Plc., followed BP's lead by announcing on Monday that it will be ending partnerships with Russian state-controlled Gazprom, including the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. 3. Equinor ASA Norway’s biggest energy company, Equinor ASA, has announced that it will start withdrawing from its joint ventures in Russia, worth about $1.2 billion. 4. Government Pension Fund of Norway The world's largest sovereign wealth fund said it is freezing Russian assets worth about $2.8 billion and will announce a plan to exit by March 15.  5. Baker McKenzie The Chicago-headquartered law firm has announced that it will cut off ties with several Russian clients as their way of complying with sanctions. The law firm also said Monday that it was reviewing its operations in Russia. 6. Linklaters The London-based law firm announced in a statement that it is ""reviewing all of the firm’s Russia-related work."" 7. McKinsey & Co. The management consultancy's global managing partner Bob Sternfels condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine and declare that the firm will no longer do business with any government entity in Russia. However, the firm won't be closing Moscow's office. 8. Daimler Truck Holding AG One of leaders among commercial vehicle manufacturers, Daimler Truck Holding AG, said it will stop its business activities in Russia until further notice, and is considering reviewing ties with Russian joint venture partner Kamaz PJSC.  9. Volvo Car AB and Volvo AB The Swedish vehicle manufacturer announced halting sales and production in Russia. 10. Harley-Davidson Inc.  The American motorcycle manufacturer announced in a statement the suspension of its business in Russia. 11. General Motors Co. America's largest automobile manufacturer said it was halting shipments to Russia, citing ""a number of external factors, including supply chain issues and other matters beyond the company’s control."" On the other side, some companies announced exiting Ukraine and not Russia because of concerns over safety. For example, Coca-Cola's European bottling partner, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company has closed its operations in Ukraine.  12. Maersk The Danish shipping company and which is considered the the world's largest container shipping line announced suspending deliveries to and from Russia. ""The safety of our people is our number one priority and we have enacted our contingency plans that include stopping production in the Ukraine, closing our plant and asking colleagues in the country to remain at home and follow local guidance,"" Coca-Cola HBC said in a statement."

British energy giant Shell PLC became the latest big Western company to sever ties with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying it would pull back from joint projects in the country and quit its role financing the now-halted Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Shell's decision Monday came a day after BP PLC said it would exit its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft, under pressure from the U.K. government, and as international condemnation of Russia increasingly strained its economy.
The moves are part of a broader re-evaluation by Western companies of their businesses in Russia, with some curtailing their operations there or deciding to leave entirely, following the attack on Ukraine and escalating sanctions by the West.
Elsewhere Monday, Norwegian energy company Equinor ASA said it would exit its Russian investments, Daimler Truck Holding AG said it would stop sending components to its Russian joint-venture partner, and Volvo Car AB said it would halt business in Russia. Separately, Renault SA shut down a factory near Moscow because it can't get enough parts, and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand paused sales of cars already in Russia to adjust for the drop in the ruble.
A few decades ago, the fall of the Soviet Union made Russia a promising new market for Western businesses. Big energy companies, car makers and brewers, among others, have set down deep roots in the country, expanding their operations there and buying or partnering with local businesses in an effort to tap millions of new consumers, as well as vast natural resources.
Now, following the aggression in Ukraine -- and the retaliatory measures by the West -- companies operating in Russia are grappling with new challenges spanning logistics to reputation. Still, it isn't clear how permanent any move away from Russia might be. If the geopolitical and sanctions situation evolves, companies' thinking about disengaging from Russia might, too. Sanctions against Russian individuals and banks, for now, are set to make it much harder for international companies to operate there, lawyers said.
""It is going to be incredibly difficult with regulatory restrictions, and regulatory uncertainty, because the sanctions are changing rapidly,"" said David Savage, head of financial crime at London-based law firm Stewarts Law LLP.
Rachel Alpert, a partner at law firm Jenner & Block, said Western companies would now need to check whether export controls used to curtail Russia's access to technology don't affect anything they bring into the country. They also would have to ensure that any individual or businesses they deal with aren't sanctioned, she said, adding that sanctions against banks would likely make it harder to pay suppliers and workers.
Shell's decision to pull back from its role in a consortium of five Western energy companies financing Nord Stream 2 marks a major symbolic decision against a project that has sparked controversy since inception. The U.S. said last week it would impose sanctions on the pipeline's construction company, following Germany's announcement that it wouldn't proceed with certifying the pipeline for use.
Shell and its financing partners each agreed in 2017 to lend as much as 950 million euros (around $1 billion) to fund the pipeline. Nord Stream 2 AG, the Switzerland-based company behind the project, is owned by Russia's Gazprom PJSC. The operating company didn't respond to a request to comment Monday.
Shell said it would also exit other joint ventures with Gazprom, including its 27.5% stake in an offshore gas project in Russia's far east that supplies about 4% of the world's liquefied-natural-gas market. Shell said it has around $3 billion in noncurrent assets in its Russian ventures and that it expects to book impairments.
The London-listed company said it was prompted to act by Russia's offensive. ""We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,"" Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said.
BP relies on Rosneft for about one-third of its oil-and-gas production and faces a potential financial hit of as much as $25 billion from exiting its stake. It isn't yet clear how BP would make such a move. BP said Chief Executive Bernard Looney and former CEO Bob Dudley resigned from Rosneft's board. BP shares closed down 4% in London on Monday.
Other energy companies are pulling back from Russia. Equinor, majority-owned by the Norwegian state, said it would stop new investments in Russia and start exiting its joint ventures there. ""In the current situation, we regard our position as untenable,"" CEO Anders Opedal said.
Separately, Norway's huge sovereign-wealth fund said it would divest itself of its Russian holdings. Norges Bank Investment Management, the arm of the Norwegian central bank that operates the $1.3 trillion fund, is freezing investments in Russia while it works on a plan to quit the Russian market.
Aside from energy, Russia has also become a big market for Western automotive companies. Daimler Truck said Monday that it would suspend deliveries of components to its Russian partner Kamaz.
""In view of the events of the last few days, we have decided to discontinue our business activities in Russia with immediate effect until further notice,"" Daimler Truck CEO Martin Daum said.
Daimler AG in December split into Daimler Truck and car maker Mercedes-Benz Group AG. Mercedes holds the company's 15% stake in Kamaz.
Daimler Truck's decision comes after media reports that it was providing components to Kamaz that could be used to produce armored military vehicles. Mr. Daum dismissed the reports, saying the components were strictly civilian.
Asked whether Mercedes could look to divest itself of the stake in Kamaz altogether, a spokeswoman said: ""In the light of current events, it is of course now necessary to reassess business activities.""
Volvo Car and truck maker Volvo AB both said Monday that they would halt business in Russia until further notice. The Swedish car brand said its decision was based on ""the potential risks associated with trading material with Russia, including the sanctions imposed by the EU and U.S."" The truck maker, which isn't connected to the car brand, cited a similar rationale.
Other car companies flagged different complications Monday. Volkswagen said its luxury car unit Audi has stopped selling cars that are already with dealers in Russia so it can adjust the price of the vehicles to reflect the decline in the value of the ruble. A VW spokesman declined to comment on the company's future in Russia more broadly.
Renault said it was shutting its plant near Moscow this week due to logistics issues stemming from Western measures against Russia. The country has become one of the French car maker's largest markets after it struck a 2014 deal to take a controlling stake -- alongside its partner Nissan Motor Co. -- in AvtoVAZ, the former state-owned Lada manufacturer.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia was seen by auto makers as a potential gold mine. By 2015, new car sales there had risen to about 2.8 million vehicles, nearly as big as the German market. But Russia's political and economic woes since its invasion of Crimea in 2014 have led the market to decline steadily.
Last year, about 1.67 million new cars were sold in Russia, according to Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management. He said Russian automotive exports -- vehicles and parts -- had a total value of $3.3 billion before the pandemic, compared with $20 billion for imports.
Other large Western companies with sizable footprints in Russia include Carlsberg AS. The Danish brewer generates around 10% of its sales in Russia, where it operates several breweries and has about 8,400 staff. The company said it was staying in Russia and that while it was difficult to estimate the full consequences of sanctions, it expected the local nature of its production, suppliers and customers to limit their direct impact.
France's Danone SA said it was monitoring the situation and taking action to ensure the safety of its employees, as well as business continuity. The yogurt maker employs about 8,000 people in Russia at more than a dozen sites, mostly making products for the local market.

Oil companies haven't been this financially strong in decades. They also haven't been as politically vulnerable.
BP's (ticker: BP) decision this weekend to divest its stake in Russian energy company Rosneft at a large loss is evidence of just how fraught the politics of oil production has become. Selling stakes in Russian companies now means that companies will be selling into a washed-out market with few buyers. BP alone could take a hit of $25 billion.
Norwegian oil company Equinor (EQNR) also said it would start exiting its Russian joint ventures. BP's stock was down 6.8% on Monday, though Equinor was up 0.9%. Oil prices were rising, with Brent crude futures up 2% to $100 per barrel.
Midday on Monday, Shell (SHEL) Shell announced that it would end partnerships with Gazprom, potentially leading to impairments on about $3 billion of assets. ""We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement . ""Our decision to exit is one we take with conviction.""
Shell has an important business interest there, holding 27.5% of Sakhalin-2, a multifaceted liquefied natural gas project that it says supplies about 4% of the world's LNG.
They are not the only energy companies with exposure to Russia that could face pressure in the coming days.
Exxon Mobil (XOM) has a 30% stake in offshore oil project Sakhalin-1, which it calls ""one of the largest single international direct investments in Russia."" Exxon first signed on in 1995. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Chevron (CVX) has some involvement in Russia through a stake in a pipeline that takes crude oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told Bloomberg on Monday that the company isn't seeing ""operational impacts"" and ""we really don't have much exposure either in Ukraine or in Russia.""
Oil services firm Schlumberger (SLB) also has operations in Russia and has spoken about the country on conference calls over the past few years. A spokesperson wrote that ""Schlumberger is closely monitoring the situation between Russia and Ukraine as well as other neighboring countries.""
Not every possible exposure to Russia is significant for investors. In a report looking at companies with ties to the country, J.P. Morgan analysts did not mention Chevron, and found that Schlumberger, Shell, and Exxon had ""more modest"" exposure than BP.
The U.S. companies may face pressure to shift assets, but they don't have quite the same relationship to the government that many European companies do. Equinor, for instance, is 67%-owned by the government of Norway. Companies with ties to the government are more likely to face political pressure.
The J.P. Morgan analysts found a handful of other European energy companies with exposure in Russia. Among the oil and gas names with significant exposure are Austrian company OMV (OMVKY) and German company Wintershall DEA, which is part-owned by BASF (BASFY).
""OMV has a crisis team in place that continuously analyzes and evaluates the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken if necessary,"" a spokesperson wrote. ""Please understand that we cannot comment any further at the moment.""
A Wintershall spokesman said, ""Our board is already analyzing the situation thoroughly, including legal implications.""
RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft tells Barron's that political pressure is rising for companies that do business in Russia, and the latest sanctions may not be the last. Ukraine's government has been effective in pressuring companies and countries to get out of Russia, with Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba saying ""every Russian ruble has a mark of Ukrainian blood on it.""
""These companies are going to face a lot of political pressure, because Ukraine's leadership has been so effective, and so powerful in making these calls for the international community to essentially divest from Russia,"" Croft said. ""It's turning into a divestiture movement.""

It takes a brave investor to bet on the outcome of Vladimir Putin's saber rattling around his neighbor Ukraine. One result of the Ukraine crisis seems more predictable: The European Union will look to cut its dependence on Russian natural gas, which currently accounts for 40% of consumption. Companies from Norway to Texas might benefit.
The simplest way to replace Russian flows , if you were sitting over a game of Risk on a rainy afternoon, would be U.S. liquefied natural gas. America has more gas in the ground than it can use domestically. LNG output jumped 42% year on year in the first half of 2021.
It could climb another 80% over the next five years, says Randy Giveans, head of energy maritime equity research at Jefferies. Top producer Cheniere Energy (ticker: LNG) is earning $100 million on every shipload right now, Giveans estimates. Its stock has risen by two-thirds over the past year.
Finding the next Cheniere Energy story is anything but simple, however. Multibillion-dollar LNG projects require core customers who will commit to 20-year contracts. These kind of customers are scarce despite the current boom. ""There are a lot of conversations going on, but a dearth of final investment decisions,"" Giveans says.
Jefferies is playing the bull gas market through infrastructure suppliers like Golar LNG (GLNG). This company operates floating LNG units that can sail around the world to tap spare capacity or demand. Giveans also likes GasLog Partners (GLOP), a specialist LNG shipper.
Russia's new wave of aggression is ""more likely to spur oil than gas investment,"" as Putin stokes worries about crude supply, says Leo Mariani, an oil and gas analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. U.S. shale oil producers have learned the lesson of previous bull cycles, when they pumped enough to crash the market. ""U.S. production will probably rise by 800,000 barrels a day this year, not 1.4 million like in the old days,"" he says.
That's good news for some smaller producers who can fly under investors' radar, like SM Energy (SM) and Talos Energy (TALO), Mariani says.
In Europe itself, Russian tensions are breathing new life into some old alternatives. This year, the Netherlands government was set to close its Groningen gas field, exploited since the 1960s by Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Shell (SHELL.Netherlands). Instead, the economics ministry doubled its output target, and it could keep pumping until 2026, says Kateryna Filippenko, global gas-supply analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
A surer thing is Norway's Equinor Energy (EQNR), the company formerly known as Statoil. Equinor pushed natural-gas output to a record last quarter, and has a lot more runway. Half the reserves at its giant Troll field remain untapped, the company says. Equinor shares have soared 40% in the past six months.
Europe will stay energy-dependent on Russia for the foreseeable future—particularly Germany, which buys fully half its gas from state-owned monopolist Gazprom (GAZP.Russia). ""For now, Russia has market power in Europe,"" says Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in energy security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
But alternatives have already muted Moscow's most realistic supply threat, cutting gas flows through Ukraine.
""Europe's additional levers can get it through this year and fill up next year's storage"" in that event, Filippenko says.
Additional levers could also prove profitable for alert investors.

It incorporates two divisions - Proserv Controls and Gilmore - providing tailored solutions to clients right across the energy sector. The company said it will harness its new, disruptive ECG holistic cable monitoring system to deliver this project. ECG has been initiated and driven by Proserv with critical support from its partner Synaptec, a power system monitoring expert, it stated.ECG represents a step-change in traditional monitoring methods, offering comprehensive visibility across cable assets. Adopting an integrated and scalable approach, it provides real-time analysis with insights through an intuitive user interface. By using intelligence from all data across an asset, the system is capable of enabling proactive and predictive decision-making, improved utilisation of resources and reduced operational expenditure (Opex).Proserv’s Great Yarmouth Centre of Excellence team will be executing the full scope of supply, with both Dogger Bank A and B systems scheduled to be ready for dispatch in Q3 2022. The extent of the scope of supply will include a cable monitoring system solution for each phase, integrating applicable sensor interrogator technology. The hardware will be complemented by the intuitive human-machine interface, utilising Proserv’s TIACS software suite.Paul Cook, Business Development Director (Renewables) Proserv Controls, said: ""Dogger Bank represents one of the most important offshore wind projects under construction, so this success for our new ECG holistic cable monitoring system is a major endorsement of our market proposition, and a significant step forward in Proserv’s renewables strategy.""""We are delighted that Deme Offshore has chosen to work with us in the vital area of cable asset management and to utilise our exciting technology delivering synchronous, real-time monitoring,"" remarked Cook. ECG aims to reduce cable faults and failures, optimise performance and enable more targeted Opex via improved visibility of asset integrity. ""In line with our philosophy at Proserv, we will continue to enhance our ECG platform and seek to develop further disruptive and compelling offerings,"" he added.Dogger Bank Wind Farm is being delivered by joint venture partners SSE Renewables, Equinor and Eni. SSE Renewables is leading on construction and delivery while Equinor will operate the wind farm on completion. Due to its size and scale, Dogger Bank is being built in three consecutive 1.2GW phases; Dogger Bank A, Dogger Bank B and Dogger Bank C. In total the wind farm is expected to generate enough renewable electricity to supply 5% of the UK’s demand, equivalent to powering six million homes.Halfdan Brustad, VP Dogger Bank (Operations) said: ""In another world first for the project, we’re looking forward to using this high-tech system to support us in optimising our assets during the operational phase."" ""With vast experience in the oil and gas sector, Proserv is now translating its subsea experience into solutions for offshore wind. We’re excited to be supporting them on this journey as their first ECG customer, and we look forward to working with them, alongside Deme, as we continue to build this innovative and world-class wind farm,"" stated Brustad. Proserv Controls CEO Davis Larssen said: ""This award from Deme Offshore marks a very significant win for Proserv. We have clear, proactive plans to grow our business in the offshore wind segment, as the world gradually transitions to more sustainable forms of energy.""""Our ECG technology is a combination of our subsea heritage and expertise being brought together with our renowned ability to innovate new solutions.

ADELAIDE, Australia -- KoBold Metals, a startup backed by Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy Ventures that aims to use artificial intelligence to find metals needed for the electric-vehicle boom, raised $192.5 million in its latest financing round, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Investors in the Series B funding round for the Berkeley, Calif., company included Sam Altman's Apollo Projects and Mary Meeker's Bond Capital as well as mining giant BHP Group Ltd. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's largest pension fund, one of the people said.
Angel investors included Scott Belsky, chief product officer at Adobe Inc., and Lyft Inc. President John Zimmer. Existing backers Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Equinor Ventures, the startup investing arm of Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA, also joined the round.
KoBold, founded in 2018, says it can change the way minerals are discovered by mining data for clues about where deposits of cobalt, copper, nickel or lithium might be found in the Earth's crust.
KoBold says it uses AI to guide where to procure land, what data to collect, and where to drill. It has collected publicly available data from company disclosures and government sources, as well as historical information from companies it partners with. Its algorithms then crunch that data in search of patterns.
Global mining companies say exploring for metals is getting tougher as demand is accelerating for materials used in the transition away from fossil fuels. As a result, they expect to look for new deposits much deeper beneath the surface or in countries that pose greater risks to their business, including through resources nationalism.
Investors worry the world is on track for large shortages of battery materials that could hinder the shift toward a low-carbon economy.

BP Energy Partners is leading a $28 million investment in Context Labs BV, a developer of systems that harvest and crunch data -- from satellite imagery to oil-well output -- to help businesses track their carbon emissions.
Context Labs offers software as a service that can gather high volumes of data and provide attributes such as time and location, to map sources of carbon emissions and help companies spot faulty equipment, said Dan Harple, Context Labs's founder and chief executive. All collected data is validated -- when, for example, sensor calibrations are checked -- and encrypted into a blockchain ledger where it can be audited but not changed, he said.
""If it was tampered with, we have algorithms that would detect that,"" Mr. Harple said. ""It's a way of building trust in the data.""
The software can be used, for example, to collect and analyze data from a high-precision thermal camera to tell a pipeline operator in Texas which equipment in a gas-compression station emits abnormal levels of methane.
Mr. Harple started Context Labs in Cambridge, Mass., in 2013. The company began to focus on emissions data after he realized the difficulties that businesses face when reliably measuring how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases they are responsible for.
""Every company now has an energy-transition strategy,"" he said. Context Labs can help them make their emissions ""more digitally quantifiable,"" he added.
Nathan Brawn, a managing director at BP Energy in Dallas, said alternative methods used to evaluate the carbon footprint of an operation rely either on specific measuring devices or third-party certifications.
""A lot of it is qualitative and not going after what's actually happening on the ground day to day,"" Mr. Brawn said.
BP Energy, which also has formed a joint venture with Context Labs, sees a chance to capitalize on an increased desire in the energy industry to reduce ambiguity in reporting environmental impacts, he said.
""Energy companies will have to really quantify their environmental performance going forward,"" Mr. Brawn said. ""Finding ways to enable them to do that more accurately is incredibly important to the energy transition.""
By enabling companies to more accurately measure and document their carbon footprint, the systems Context Labs offers may help reduce greenwashing, or exaggerating environmental benefits, and lead investors to businesses that are really making progress, said Chief Operating Officer Mark McDivitt.
""The challenge right now in the global market is putting a proper price on carbon,"" Mr. McDivitt said.
Other participants in the investment in Context Labs include consulting firm KPMG LLP; Equinor Ventures, the venture-capital arm of energy company Equinor ASA; family office Shamrock Ventures; impact investor i(x) Investments; and Neglected Climate Opportunities LLC, an affiliate of the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust.

As a result, they expect to look for new deposits much deeper beneath the surface or in countries that pose greater risks to their business, including through resources nationalism.
Investors worry the world is on track for large shortages of battery materials that could hinder the shift toward a low-carbon economy.
KoBold aims to change the mind-set of an industry that has long relied heavily on sampling soil and sediment and drilling holes in the ground to determine whether areas contain valuable minerals. While the company still leans on those techniques, it hopes to limit the chances of failure by drawing on machine learning and other scientific computing techniques.
In September, KoBold formed an exploration alliance with BHP, the world's largest mining company by market value. It is one of a number of partnerships it has with resources companies world-wide.
""Globally, shallow ore deposits have largely been discovered, and remaining resources are likely deeper underground and harder to see from the surface,"" BHP's head of metals exploration, Keenan Jennings, said at the time. Miners will need to adopt new ways of working to unearth the next generation of essential materials, he said.
Some other miners including Anglo American PLC and technology-focused companies are also looking at how artificial intelligence might allow minerals to be found more easily, but those efforts haven't yet led to many big discoveries of critical commodities.
Connie Chan, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said KoBold is aiming to build ""a Google Maps for the Earth's crust.""
""It's very much just a different approach to mining; a long-term, science-driven way to mine,"" Ms. Chan said in an interview in September.
Still, some mining executives remain skeptical of the benefits of artificial intelligence in an industry where commodity-price cycles have long balanced supply and demand by attracting new investments when prices are high and deterring it when they are low.
Miners have already adopted AI to smooth other operations, such as the scheduling of trains.
The funds from KoBold's new investor syndicate will be used to accelerate efforts to find critical battery materials, one of the people said. It is currently working on exploration projects in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Greenland and Zambia.
KoBold hasn't disclosed how much it raised in its Series A financing round or its valuation.
The World Economic Forum in June included KoBold among a class of 100 companies deemed pioneers in technology, the same honor it once bestowed on a young Google Inc.

The Italian energy group has confirmed plans to list Vaar Energi, its Norwegian subsidiary. The exploration company is one of the largest foreign-owned producers in Norway. The listing could raise $1.8bn for Eni, depending on demand. Eni has plenty of free cash flow, so most of the proceeds should go to shareholders.
Try as it might to talk itself up, Eni's low stock market valuation shows that the Italian energy giant is given less respect than peers. Imminent spinouts of its renewables unit and now its Norwegian subsidiary could change that.
Yesterday, Eni fired the starting gun for the initial public offering of Var Energi, of which it owns nearly 70 per cent.
The business is active on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The region has had plenty of admirers in recent years, in contrast to the out-offavour UK North Sea. Valuations have weakened of late. But Var should still be worth about $13bn, say analysts at Société Générale.
Norway is responsible for well over half of Europe's oil production and reserves. BP, Equinor and Lundin Energy have all been active there.
Last month, Oslo-listed Aker BP gobbled up Sweden's Lundin, whose main operations are on the NCS, for $13.9bn in shares and cash.
With Brent oil at five-year highs of $87 a barrel, who can blame Eni and buyout partner HitecVision for raising a sale sign?
Even considering the oil and gas output from the enlarged Aker BP, Var would be the second largest of foreignowned exploration groups in Norway. The owners will sell only part of this relatively mature business. Assuming a fifth goes to new shareholders, one can assume that Eni's slice might be worth $1.8bn. That would come on top of
Eni's estimated free cash flow of $5.5bn this year.
Plenitude, the renewable energy unit, is tentatively valued at $10bn.
Eni should get plenty of extra distributable cash from those three sources. The dividend yield on Eni shares is already a healthy 5 per cent.
But the stock is languishing, even though plans to spin off Plenitude and Var have been well trailed.
Eni trades on an enterprise value of 3.4 times its forecast ebitda, about a tenth below peers such as Total, BP and Royal Dutch Shell.
Eni is relatively undervalued on a medium-term perspective. Investors not prohibited by ESG rules from venturing into wicked hydrocarbons could do worse than hold its shares.Valuations of selected Norwegian Continental Shelf oil producers Forward enterprise value/ebitda multiple

| Jump to first hitAN INVESTMENT from global energy company bp that could bring thousands of jobs to the region has taken a huge leap forward as the company confirmed it has submitted bids to secure support for two major low carbon energy projects.
The bp-operated Net Zero Teesside Power project (NZT Power) and bp’s H2Teesside hydrogen project have submitted bids into Phase 2 of the Government’s Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) cluster sequencing process. If the bids are successful, the projects will be eligible for government support as they continue their development.
NZT Power, a joint venture between bp and Equinor, is aiming to be the UK’s first fully integrated commercial-scale gas-fired power station with carbon capture. It could provide enough power for up to 1.3 million homes while capturing up to 2million tonnes of CO2 emissions a year. This would be transported and securely stored under the North Sea by the Northern Endurance Partnership project – a joint venture between bp, Equinor, National Grid Ventures, Shell, and Total Energies – which bp leads as operator.
NZT Power aims to be up and running within the next five years and aims to create 5,500 direct jobs during its construction and add £450million to the economy each year.
H2Teesside, announced in March 2021, is a “blue” hydrogen production facility aiming to start up in 2027 and produce 1GW of hydrogen from natural gas by 2030, which is 20% of the low-carbon hydrogen production goal stated in the Government’s Ten Point Plan for net zero. bp has signed agreements with a number of industrial customers in the region to explore their potential use of hydrogen.

The two projects are at the heart of plans to decarbonise one of the most important and energy-intensive industrial clusters in the UK, meet Government’s net zero ambitions and drive forward the region as a clean energy powerhouse.
This news follows Government’s selection in October 2021 of the Northern Endurance Partnership’s East Coast Cluster, including NZT Power, as one of the UK’s first carbon capture, usage and storage clusters following a successful bid as part of Phase 1 of Government’s CCUS cluster sequencing process.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “H2Teesside and Net Zero Teesside Power will deliver thousands of good-quality, well-paid jobs for people across Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool in the cleaner, safer and healthier industries and of the future, marking our region out as a pioneer in low carbon innovation.
“These two ground-breaking projects are putting our scientists and engineers at the forefront of developing the key technologies that will be needed the world over if we are to reduce emissions – making our region a global centre of excellence for hydrogen and carbon capture technology.
“Carbon capture is not just important for meeting our ambitious target for the UK to be net zero by 2050, its essential for decarbonising our world-leading processing and chemicals industries and safeguarding thousands of skilled, well-paid jobs in the process.”
“bp’s support for our region doesn’t just end with these projects. Its commitment to employment and education will provide a real boost to the current and future workforce. It’s fantastic that through these projects we can quickly maximise the potential of sites like Teesworks and Teesside Freeport for the good of everyone living here.”
Louise Kingham, bp’s UK head of country and senior vice president of Europe, said: “bp is backing Teesside, and these bids represent an important milestone in its development as a clean energy hub. With its tightly clustered heavy industry and proud industrial heritage, it is perfectly placed for a net zero future. We’re excited to bring our ambition and expertise to help.”
Leader of Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, Councillor Mary Lanigan, said: “This is another vital step forward as we continue to attract globally important industry to our borough which will bring high quality jobs, safeguard thousands of others and deliver on our plan to radically reduce carbon emissions.”

Aker BP will become Europe's largest independent oil producer after agreeing a $14bn cash and shares deal to take over the petroleum activities of rival Lundin Energy.
The venture between Norway's largest industrial company and BP is paying $2.2bn in cash and issuing about $11.7bn of shares to buy out the main activities of Lundin, responsible for the biggest North Sea oil find in decades.
Shares in Aker BP climbed 6 per cent yesterday while Lundin's were up 4.5 per cent.
The deal will create a larger rival to state-controlled Equinor in Norway, the most active country in western Europe for oil and gas thanks to generous exploration incentives and a mixture of mature regions such as the North and Norwegian Seas and potential for petroleum in the Arctic.
""We are now creating the exploration and production company of the future, which will offer among the lowest CO2 emissions, the lowest cost, high free cash flow and the most attractive growth pipeline in the industry, with a high dividend capacity combined with a strong investment-grade credit rating,"" Aker BP chief executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said.
The combined company will have production of about 400,000 barrels of oil and gas per day with a total resource base of 2.7bn barrels, focused on Norway.
It will be the second-biggest producer in Norway and the second-biggest owner of the giant Johan Sverdrup field, both behind Equinor.
The decision by the Swedish group and its controlling Lundin family shareholders to sell out of its largest and most profitable assets comes just weeks after prosecutors in Stockholm charged the chair and former chief executive with complicity in war crimes in Sudan.
The rump Lundin Energy will retain the company's 600GWh of renewable power assets as well as any liabilities over Sudan, even though the group vigorously contests any claim of wrongdoing against it and its officials.
Chair Ian Lundin said: ""Creating longterm value for shareholders has been at the core of this business for 20 years since inception, and this combination of Lundin Energy and Aker BP is a unique opportunity to create a future-proof independent exploration and production company, exposing shareholders to a business with significant scale, production growth and strong free cash flow into the next decade.""
Aker will own 21 per cent of the merged company, BP 16 per cent, the Lundin family 14 per cent and other shareholders 49 per cent.
Aker BP said that it would increase its dividend 14 per cent to $0.475 per share from January and aim to raise it at least 5 per cent each year from then on, assuming oil prices remained above $40 per barrel.

| Jump to first hitThe Dogger Bank UK-made steel from the country’s largest producer Tata Steel is playing a role in helping create the world’s largest offshore wind farm.Capable of providing green energy for six million homes in the UK, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm is due to be complete by 2026.The wind farm is being developed in three 1.2 giga-watt phases: Dogger Bank A, B and C. Dogger Bank A and B is a joint venture between SSE Renewables (40%), Equinor (40%) and Eni (20%). In November 2021 SSE Renewables and Equinor, 50:50 joint venture partners in Dogger Bank C, announced Eni will take a 20% stake in the final phase, with SSE Renewables and Equinor maintaining 40% stakes each, in a deal which is expected to complete in the first quarter of 2022 subject to regulatory approvals. In the first two phases of construction the vast GE Renewable Energy turbines, each one rated at 13 mega-watts – enough to power a home for two days with a single rotation – will sit on foundations featuring Tata Steel products used in safety-critical transitions pieces. These steel structures form the junction between the tower above the surface of the sea and the foundations below the water.Fabrication companies Sif and Smulders were awarded contracts to provide the wind turbine foundations for the first two phases of Dogger Bank in November 2020, with Dogger Bank C awarded a year later.Steel made in Tata Steel’s Port Talbot plant and processed into hollow sections at the company’s Corby and Hartlepool sites is being fabricated by one of the thousands of contract companies helping to build the first two phases of the wind farm. Sandip Biswas, Chairman of the Board of Tata Steel UK, said: “We are proud to be able to help support UK jobs and manufacturing through this project.”Hundreds of tonnes of Tata Steel products, able to endure the harsh North Sea conditions, will be used in the first two phases of the giant wind farm project, which is located 130 kms off the North East coast of England.Sandip added: “Huge amounts of steel will be needed to help the UK achieve its net-zero goals – to build everything from renewable energy and low-CO2 transportation to hydrogen production and distribution.“At the same time, we have targets for our own decarbonisation as a steelmaker. Our own transition to a decarbonised future will rely on a secure supply of competitively priced renewable energy – whether that be to create hydrogen for future steelmaking or power new low-CO2 furnaces. The more we can help in delivering these landmark projects the better.”Dogger Bank Wind Farm Project Director, Steve Wilson, said: “This is another great example of how we’re taking advantage of UK skills and expertise to build the world’s largest offshore wind farm. Our transition pieces are among the largest to be installed on an offshore wind farm, and this UK-manufactured steel will form some of the supporting components.“Dogger Bank Wind Farm is already creating or supporting more than 3,000 jobs in the UK supply chain, and giving companies the chance to work on a pioneering project which will help them become increasingly competitive as the world adapts to produce energy that doesn’t cost the earth.”-- TradeArabia News Service"

| Jump to first hitEQUINOR is looking to offload a 19 per cent stake in the Martin Linge oilfield based in the North Sea, according to reports from Reuters yesterday.
The energy company is aiming to raise $1bn from any potential sale.
Equinor currently holds a 70 per cent stake in the field and Petoro, which manages Norway's interests in offshore oil and gas licences, owns the remaining 30 per cent.
Lambert Energy has reportedly been selected to market the oilfield to potential bidders.
The Martin Linge offshore field began production in July, and is expected to reach a peak output of 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day next year.
However, the proposed sale of the near one-fifth stake for $1bn would place the oilfield's overall value below its $7.3bn development costs, which doubled after multiple production delays including a fatal accident at a South Korean shipyard and problems with pre-drilled wells.
Norway's oil and gas sector has attracted a flurry of deals recently, including Centrica's sale of Spirit Energy's oil and gas facilities to Sval Energi in a $1.1bn deal last month.
Energy firms are increasingly offloading fossil fuel sites to meet climate targets, while still finding buyers as oil and gas assets remain popular with investors."

| Jump to first hitIn the process of strategic repositioning, with an eye on the energy transition, Equinor decided to halve the number of countries where it operates in the oil and gas industry. In Brazil, on the other hand, the idea is to continue growing. After announcing this year an investment of $8 billion - together with ExxonMobil and Petrogal - to start producing the Bacalhau field, in the pre-salt layer of the Santos Basin, the Norwegian oil company will work on the development of new projects by 2030 and is looking carefully at the transfer of rights surplus volume bidding of the Sépia and Atapu areas, which will take place on December 17.Equinor is one of 11 companies qualified for the round, which will require disbursements of R$11.1 billion in signature bonus payments for the two assets. During a visit to Brazil last week, Equinor’s executive vice president of international exploration and production, Al Cook, said he sees Sepia and Atapu as ""great fields"" of the kind ""that any oil and gas company in the world looks at."" The decision to take part in the bidding, however, will depend on calculations of the rate of return.""We will base our decision on how we can generate value,"" the executive told Valor.The surplus are the discovered volumes of oil that exceed the 5 billion barrels that Petrobras is entitled to produce in the pre-salt layer, as part of the transfer-of-rights contract signed in 2010.In 2019, the government offered the surplus of the Búzios, Atapu, Itapu and Sépia fields. At the time, oil companies saw many risks - the main one was the need to negotiate with Petrobras, after the contracts were signed, the amount of compensation for the investments the Brazilian oil company had already made in the assets.After the setback, the government reviewed some rules. The main novelty is that, after talks between Petrobras and the state-owned company Pré-Sal Petróleo SA (PPSA), the value of the financial compensation to be paid to the Brazilian oil company was calculated prior to the auction. In addition, the bonuses were reduced by 70% compared to the terms of the 2019 bid.Mr. Cook comments that, since then, the industry has undergone a deep transformation following the outbreak of the pandemic. He cites that oil companies’ commitments to emissions reductions have sharpened. ""But the quality of Brazil’s assets remains the same,"" he said.The bidding for Sépia and Atapu comes at a time when the Senate is debating taxing oil exports to finance a possible creation of a fuel price stabilization fund. Equinor declined to comment on the matter. In a note, the Brazilian Petroleum Institute (IBP) warned, however, that if passed by Congress, the proposal negatively impacts ongoing and future projects and reduces the attractiveness of new auctions, especially considering energy transition.Mr. Cook said that a key point of the Sépia and Atapu auction is that the assets are already in the production phase. ""For us, the combination of assets in production and development is what makes Brazil so attractive,"" he said.Since 2017, Equinor has halved the number of countries where it operates in oil and gas exploration and production, to about 15. The company is exiting Australia, Mexico, Ireland and Nicaragua, for instance. Brazil is among the three main destinations for the company’s investments. ""In the countries where we stay, we will really invest, to make a difference,"" he said.The Norwegian company is currently looking for projects with return rates above 20%, considering oil prices at $60 a barrel, and fields with carbon intensity below 8 kilograms of CO2 per barrel. The company bets on assets that give a fast return, that pay themselves off in 2.5 years after the start of production, and that have a breakeven price below $35 a barrel.Bacalhau is one of the main fronts in the company’s project portfolio. The field’s first platform, of 220,000 barrels a day, is under construction in China and is expected to start producing in 2024. The second production unit is scheduled to start operating by the end of the decade, but the project’s advance still depends on the drilling campaign in the north part of the area. Drilling in the region, he said, will help broaden knowledge about the reservoirs and ""tell what can be done in project design.""Equinor expects to start, in the first half of the next year, phase 2 of Peregrino, operated by the company in the post-salt of Campos Basin. The project, which has been delayed due to the pandemic, is based on installing a third fixed platform that will make it possible to reach previously inaccessible reservoirs. The idea is to increase the field’s productive life and add up to 300 million barrels in recoverable reserves.The company has today two operational assets. In addition to operating Peregrino, Equinor partnered with Petrobras and holds a 25% stake in the Roncador field. The Norwegian company is in talks with the Brazilian company to revitalize this mature asset. Mr. Cook said the companies managed to reduce by 50% the costs of the wells in the project. ""This gives us confidence for the next steps,"" he said.Another important asset in the company’s portfolio is the Pão de Açúcar natural gas discovery (BM-C-33), in the Campos pre-salt. The big challenge to make the project viable is the monetization of the gas. The final investment decision should be made in 2023.Equinor produces 33,000 barrels a day of oil in Brazil. The multinational has already announced plans to produce between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels a day in the country by 2030. Mr. Cook, however, adopts a more cautious approach. ""We are not chasing production volumes, but goals of [generating] value.""On the exploration side, he said that the latest drilling done by the company in the country did not have the expected success. The company is now focused on processing the knowledge gained from the drilling before moving on to new campaigns."

Voltus Inc. is going public by combining with a special-purpose acquisition company in a merger that values the electricity-market technology startup at about $1.3 billion, the companies said.
Based in San Francisco, Voltus uses software to manage small, decentralized electricity systems known as distributed energy resources for customers such as Coca-Cola Co. and Home Depot Inc. Called DERs, distributed energy resources are anything that consumes, produces or stores electricity and can be connected to a grid. Examples include a store's electricity demand and electric-vehicle charging.
By teaming up with grid operators in the U.S. and Canada to connect DERs to larger markets, Voltus says it saves corporate customers money and delivers more reliable and sustainable electricity. Chief Executive Gregg Dixon compared Voltus to home-rental firm Airbnb Inc. in that Voltus makes each DER a financial asset, letting customers sell their excess electricity back to the grid.
Some analysts say widespread adoption of DERs will be critical to reducing the world's dependence on fossil-fuel-consuming power plants and decarbonizing the economy.
""We're at a really incredible inflection point in electricity markets,"" Mr. Dixon said.
Founded in 2016, Voltus is merging with the SPAC Broadscale Acquisition Corp., one of many so-called blank-check firms focused on environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- factors.
Many other startups tied to green energy have recently reached similar SPAC deals, in part because such mergers allow them to make business projections. Those aren't allowed in traditional initial public offerings. SPAC deals also let companies quickly generate cash and raise their profiles, executives say.
As part of its SPAC merger, Voltus is raising a $100 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE. PIPE investors include Equinor Ventures, the startup investing arm of Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA, and Ev Williams, co-founder of Twitter Inc. and Obvious Ventures.
That money and funds held by the SPAC could be used to accelerate Voltus's growth globally. The Broadscale SPAC is backed by the investment firms Broadscale Group LLC and Hepco Capital Management LLC and holds $345 million, though investors can withdraw money before the deal goes through. Low share prices often provide an incentive for such withdrawals.
A SPAC is a shell firm that raises money and trades on a stock exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private company such as Voltus to take it public. After regulators review the private company's financial and ownership information and the deal is completed, the private firm then replaces the SPAC in the stock market.
SPACs have raised more than $150 billion this year, nearly doubling last year's then-record total, according to SPAC Research.
To ease concerns about SPAC insiders disproportionately benefiting from such deals at the expense of other investors, Voltus executives and the blank-check company creators have made some of their shares subject to the stock price rising.
Broadscale Acquisition CEO Andrew Shapiro said Voltus can be ""a truly world-changing company"" and a good investment because it is a green-energy technology firm that doesn't need heavy spending or tangible assets to grow.

| Jump to first hitDays before a global pandemic was officially declared last year - just as an oil-price war was erupting - Vermilion Energy began to retrench.
As the Calgary-based company's share price plunged almost 19 per cent one day in early March 2020, then-CEO Tony Marino cautioned that the virus had ""dramatically altered individual, business and government behaviour ... and commodity prices.""
By that May, Marino had left Vermilion, the company had suspended its dividend and lowered its capital spending. Former CFO Curtis Hicks returned as president, with a sharp focus on paying down debt.
On Monday, the mid-sized producer signalled it's looking beyond retrenchment, announcing a $556-million deal to increase its stake in the Corrib natural gas project, located about 80 kilometres off the northwest coast of Ireland.
It will acquire the interest from Norway's Equinor ASA in a cash transaction.
Vermilion also said it will reinstate a quarterly dividend at six cents per share in the first quarter of 2022, and it unveiled a $425-million capital budget for next year, up 13 per cent from 2021 levels.
""I came back shortly after the dividend was suspended. I know it was tough - tough for the board, it was tough for staff. The future was a little bit bleak when you looked at the amount of debt we had,"" Hicks said in an interview Monday.
""It was a challenge. We developed a new strategic plan and the primary focus was debt-reduction ... We've been fortunate, the last 18 months, that commodity prices have responded favourably and we positioned ourselves to take advantage of that.""
Investors welcomed Monday's announcement as Vermilion's shares jumped 10 per cent to close Monday at $12.65 in Toronto, and rose another .09 per cent Tuesday to $12.76. Benchmark U.S. oil prices recovered some ground from a $10-a-barrel drop on Friday, closing at US$69.95 on Monday and at US$68.36 on Tuesday.
Vermilion's acquisition, along with several other oilpatch moves in recent weeks, highlights an industry that's now moving forward, paying down debt and looking for opportunities, even as commodity prices gyrate wildly.
""It's nice to see companies not have to be focused on just basic survival and ... be able to be more strategic,"" said Patrick O'Rourke, an analyst with ATB Capital Markets. ""This is what you have to do to build a good long-term business that sustains a dividend.""
Vermilion, which saw its net debt top $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2020, expects to exit the year around $1.65 billion, and reduce it to less than $1.3 billion by the end of 2022.
""We feel good about the progress compared to where we were 12 to 18 months ago, but (debt repayment) is still a focus,"" Hicks said. ""But also, we will be opportunistic if the right opportunities come along, and this was certainly one of those opportunities we couldn't pass up.""
With the Corrib deal, Vermilion is increasing its interest to 56.5 per cent from 20 per cent in a project it operates. The gas field began producing in 2015.
""We have taken the decision to sell the asset to focus our portfolio ... and to free up capital that we can reinvest elsewhere,"" Equinor said in a news release.
The agreement will increase Vermilion's exposure to European natural gas markets and it comes at an opportune time. Gas prices in Europe have soared this year, with futures contracts for 2022 trading around $23 per mmBTU.
Hicks, who is retiring and will be replaced by vice-president Dion Hatcher on Jan. 1, said once the company achieves its debt targets, ""then we can start looking at reallocating some of that free cash flow and return capital to shareholders.""
Vermilion has a diverse asset base, with operations in Canada and the U.S., as well as Europe and Australia. The deal increases its geographic diversity, with international assets set to make up about 39 per cent of overall production.
Analyst Jeremy McCrea with Raymond James said Vermilion was able to acquire the asset at an attractive price as large European producers like Equinor are looking to sell off oil and gas properties.
For Vermilion, the dividend return next year is a relatively modest expense, expected to cost the company about $40 million.
However, investors say it's a necessary move for oil and gas producers as others rivals have bumped up their dividends in recent months with the upswing in commodity prices.
""It's a supreme disadvantage to not have a dividend,"" said Eric Nuttall, a senior portfolio manager with Ninepoint Partners.
""It's a 100-per-cent must ... It puts you on the radar screen for dividends funds, it makes you much more palatable to the retail community.""
Monday's announcement is another sign of the improving financial strength of Canadian petroleum producers.
For example, Cenovus Energy announced recently it will double its dividend in the fourth quarter; it's also reduced net debt by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2021.
Similarly, Suncor Energy said last month it would double its quarterly dividend and noted company debt levels have fallen by $3.1 billion through the first three quarters.
On Monday, MEG Energy unveiled a $375-million capital budget for next year, up slightly from $335 million in 2021.
With current oil prices, ""MEG intends to begin allocating a portion of free cash flow generated to shareholder returns in 2022 while continuing to prioritize ongoing debt reduction,"" the company said in a statement.
""These aren't the businesses that we know from pre-COVID here,"" McCrea added.
""There's been a lot of restructuring forced upon them in COVID and these companies have come out much stronger.""

| Jump to first hitSEMBCORP Marine (Sembmarine) will be closely watched this week by analysts and investors as Temasek Holdings' mandatory conditional general offer at S$0.08 per share closes on Wednesday (Nov 3) at 5.30 pm.
While confidence in the beleaguered offshore and marine (O&M) company is very weak, its shares appear to be trading well below their intrinsic value.
Provenance Capital - Sembmarine's independent financial adviser (IFA) - estimates the company's net asset value (NAV) as at Jun 30 adjusted for its recent rights issue stood at S$0.1437 per share.
Sembmarine has warned it could report a loss for H2 2021 close to the loss of S$647 million it reported for H1 2021. Taking this into account, the IFA estimates Sembmarine's NAV as at Dec 31 will be approximately S$0.1246 per share.
The IFA also noted in its Oct 20 letter to Sembmarine's independent directors that valuing certain group assets (mainly the yards) on a discounted cash flow basis would put Sembmarine's revalued NAV at between S$0.1697 and S$0.2043 per share.
Provenance Capital further pointed out that seven ""comparable companies"" it identified - Keppel Corp, Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, Aker ASA, CSSC Offshore and Marine Engineering, Samsung Heavy Industries, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering and Saipem - were trading at between 0.7 times and 2.8 times their NAVs.
The IFA went on to say that its ""estimated value range"" for Sembmarine for the purposes of the offer is between S$0.125 and S$0.14 per share.
Given that Temasek has only offered to pay S$0.08 per share for Sembmarine, the IFA has declared its offer to be ""not fair and not reasonable"". Sembmarine's IDs have recommended that investors reject the offer.
Yet, it has been three months since Sembmarine even came close to trading at the bottom end of the IFA's estimated value range. In fact, shares in Sembmarine have been dipping below Temasek's offer price of S$0.08 with increasing persistence in recent weeks.
Sembmarine closed Friday at S$0.079.
What is weighing the stock down? Is this an opportunity to buy Sembmarine at a bargain price? Or, will things get worse before they get better?
Pandemic problems
It is worth noting that Temasek's offer is conditional upon it receiving sufficient acceptances to push its stake in Sembmarine to more than 50 per cent.
If Temasek's stake in Sembmarine does not cross the 50 per cent threshold by the close of the offer, investors who had accepted the offer might then choose to sell their Sembmarine shares in the market.
Temasek held a 46.6 per cent stake in Sembmarine just prior to the offer.
In the meantime, unfolding events have continued to underscore the basic problem that has dogged Sembmarine - that is, pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and labour issues causing project delays and cost overruns.
On Oct 15, Sembmarine apologised to its workers housed at the Westlite Jalan Tukang Dormitory. Residents at the dormitory had vented their frustration earlier in the week about delays in medical support and poor living conditions, in an incident that drew armoured riot police to the vicinity.
Then, on Oct 24, Sembmarine sought to clarify news reports that its customer Equinor plans to transport the unfinished hull and turret for the Johan Castberg floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel from Singapore to Norway to avoid further pandemic-related delays.
Sembmarine had announced in late 2017 a US$490 million contract from Equinor (then known as Statoil Petroleum) to build the hull and living quarters of the Johan Castberg FPSO. The project was originally scheduled for completion in Q1 2020.
But the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA) became aware of quality defects in welds on the hull for the FPSO.
An investigation by PSA ensued in late 2020 and found, among other things, that welding expertise and quality control at Sembmarine were inadequate; and that Equinor failed to ""get to grips"" with these problems early enough.
In its statement on Oct 24, Sembmarine said there had been variations and additions to the scope of work for the FPSO that required additional time to execute. Nevertheless, the hull and living quarters are now largely completed.
Sembmarine went on to say that Equinor has requested that it plan the remaining scope of work to accommodate the available transportation window for the towing operations to Norway.
""Such adjustments are provided for in the terms of the contract and the company and Equinor are presently finalising these arrangements,"" Sembmarine added.
Weak sentiment
There is something to be said for Sembmarine getting delayed projects like the Johan Castberg FPSO out of the way, as it could free up capacity for potentially more profitable work.
Yet, investors do not seem to be in the mood to look for silver linings in the dark clouds hanging over Sembmarine.
Who can blame them? Sembmarine has tapped its shareholders twice since last year with deeply discounted rights issues, expanding its outstanding number of shares from less than 2.1 billion to nearly 31.4 billion, without clearly stating how it plans to staunch its losses in the event the pandemic does not subside.
Moreover, the O&M arm of Keppel Corp appears to be coping better with the pandemic than Sembmarine. Keppel said in a business update last week that Keppel O&M was profitable for the first nine months of 2021, reversing the net loss it sustained for the same period last year.
Keppel O&M also managed to deliver five major projects in Q3 2021 on time, despite facing pandemic-related supply chain and manpower challenges.
For shareholders of Sembmarine, this raises uncomfortable questions about the business strategies and priorities of their company's board and management.
It could also stoke concerns about whether Sembmarine will be fairly valued in a merger with Keppel O&M.
During a conference call last week, officials at Keppel said a ""definitive agreement"" on the merger could be hammered out as early as the end of this year - that is, before any likely turnaround in Sembmarine's profitability.
Of course, the operating backdrop for the O&M sector is dynamic and investor sentiment is notoriously fickle.
It could just be a matter of time before measures to contain Covid-19 are rolled back significantly, putting an end to the supply chain and manpower problems that have weighed on Sembmarine and turning attention to the deep discount at which its stock is trading to its book value.
Barring the emergence of such catalysts for the stock, however, it seems likely that Sembmarine will slip lower when Temasek's mandatory conditional general offer closes this week."

| Jump to first hitVietnam is already in a good position concerning making a sustainable offshore wind supply chain given existing industries and businesses with oil, and shipyards construction, while transformation into renewable energy or offshore wind is realistic and within reach.An overview of the meeting Norwegian Ambassador to Vietnam Grete Løchen made the statement at a meeting on October 28 in Hanoi with Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade (MoIT) Nguyen Hong Dien, during which the former handed over the latter a Vietnam Supply Chain Study Report for offshore wind. The meeting was also joined by Norwegian Trade Counsellor, Arne-Kjetil Lian.The Report was completed by Equinor - a Norwegian broad energy company, member of the Norwegian Energy Partners (NORWEP), which is committed to providing affordable energy for societies worldwide and taking a leading role in the energy transition. The Report also received very constructive technical inputs from the MOIT Electricity and Renewable Energy Authority (EREAV).The 70-page-long Report provides an overview of the entire supply chain for Vietnam's offshore wind industry including key players, current status, advantages and remaining gaps, with recommendations on what Vietnam can prioritize in intervention to stimulate the growth of a strong, local supply chain, and thereby create more skilled jobs, and export to other offshore wind markets. The Report also highlights opportunities that offshore wind brings to Vietnamese suppliers and identifies areas that Norwegian and foreign companies can work with Vietnamese partners to build offshore wind projects, generate power at lower costs, and gradually make renewable energy affordable for all.I am very happy to hand this Study Report over to Minister Dien today. This is particularly meaningful in the context that we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Norway-Vietnam diplomatic relations this year. The two countries have enjoyed a good relationship in numerous areas and renewable energy is a new potential one. With its long-established expertise and advanced technologies, Norway and our companies are willing to share it with Vietnamese partners for our mutual benefits and the common goals regarding climate change and sustainable development, said Norwegian Ambassador to Vietnam Grete Løchen at the function. The delegates participate in the meetingThe Government of Vietnam acknowledges the urgent needs for climate actions and a greener energy transition. By ratifying the Paris Agreement, Vietnam, like other member countries, is very aware of the dangers posed by climate change and global emissions. Shifting from coal to greener and cleaner energy is an indispensable way forward.With over 3000 kilometers of coastlines, Vietnam has an abundant offshore wind resource and is an emerging market for offshore wind. According to the World Bank, offshore wind has the potential to supply 12% of Vietnam's electricity by 2035. By gradually replacing coal-fired generation, this could help reduce to avoid over 200 million metric tons of CO2 emissions and add at least US$50 billion to Vietnam's economy from a strong local supply chain, job creation and exports. It will also attract more long-term international climate financing and investments to the country.While challenges in regulatory and policy need to be resolved in order to support large-scale deployment of offshore wind, international developers and investors including Norwegian are queuing up to exploit the opportunities. Vietnam has an extensive offshore oil & gas industry, and in order for it to work in synergy with the offshore wind, the local supply chain needs to beef up its ability to support the large scale build out of offshore turbines.Offshore wind requires technologies, which is a strength of Norwegian companies. Our companies are ready to collaborate with local partners, share expertise and technologies to help build a strong supply chain in Vietnam, and contribute to Vietnam's sustainable economic growth and energy transition said Norwegian Trade Counsellor, Arne-Kjetil Lian.A developed and strong supply chain for offshore wind is an enabling factor that decides the success of any investment project in this industry. We would like to see many offshore wind projects being launched soon in Vietnam. Equinor and the Norwegian Energy Partners (NORWEP) stand ready to enter the Vietnam's offshore wind market as soon as a suitable project is identified. As a developer, Equinor will use the findings of this Study Report for continued engagement with suppliers and mapping for our offshore wind projects in Vietnam, said Equinor's Senior Director for Business Development Vietnam Anita H.

| Jump to first hitOil firms have been banned from taking an active role in the upcoming COP26 summit.The news is a seismic victory for climate activists.It stops Big Oil companies from sponsoring the conference and steering the narrative away from their culpability in the climate crisis.The UN Climate Change Conference will take place in November in Glasgow.After emails and documents were revealed by climate change research organisation, Culture Unstained, conference organisers banned oil companies.The documents raised doubts over the oil companies claims of going net zero.Why did big oil want to sponsor COP26?In 2020, Culture Unstained revealed that major oil companies including Equinor, Shell and BP were asking to sponsor COP26.The companies also wanted to partner with the host country, the UK, to work alongside its plans.In one email, Equinor asked directly, If I was to ask you - ball park - how much money you would like from us, for what, and with what visibility for us, what would you say?The drive by oil companies to align themselves with events like COP26 is part of a general move to disassociate themselves from the global climate damage they are responsible for.A recent study revealed the disparity between the amount of publicity that oil companies seek for their sustainable projects, and the proportion of money they actually invest in those projects.Much of this promotion was also accused of being greenwashing - non-solutions to climate change claiming to be sustainable.Shell was found to have 81 per cent of its adverts dedicated to greenwashing campaigns, while still spending 80 per cent of its funds investing in fossil fuels.What was revealed?Culture Unstained has revealed that COP26 has made it a policy to exclude polluters from the summit.This came after pressure from Culture Unstained on COP and the UK government to stop oil sponsorship due to their environmental impact.Ahead of a COP26 event at the British embassy in Poland, UK civil servants argued that it was unclear whether BP's net zero commitments stack up.COP then told its staff members, BP do not currently fit our success criteria for COP26, so any speaking attendance would not be appropriate... we strongly recommend not to use COP26 branding on the comms around your event if BP are speaking.There was further confirmation of the fossil fuel ban when Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said the oil industry had been disinvited while speaking at the TED Countdown Summit.For years, oil companies have been given prominent platforms at the UN climate negotiations, promoting themselves as climate leaders while they continued to pour millions into new fossil fuels - so this is a big step forward, said Dr Chris Garrard, co-director of Culture Unstained.By excluding these firms, the organisers of COP26 have conceded that the oil industry's claims of going 'net zero' don't add up and that their actual business plans directly undermine the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement.A schism between COP26 and the UK governmentAlthough COP has barred the oil industry from being major sponsors of the upcoming conference, the UK government hasn't followed suit.After COP communicated the exclusion of BP from the British Embassy event in Poland, the Embassy responded by instead removing the COP26 branding.The Department for International Trade (DIT) also ignored COP's requirement to remove BP's branding.DIT invited BP to publish an article on its 'net zero' plan on its COP26 webpage. Writing to BP, DIT hoped the article would provide a good opportunity to showcase your net zero plans.It's not just the British government that is still willing to align with Big Oil for sponsorship.The Culture Unstained report also highlights the partnership deals that the Science Museum has announced with coal company Adani to fund a climate change gallery about 'energy transition'.The Science Museum has had long standing sponsorship deals with BP, Shell and Equinor, including having Shell as the sponsor of the 'Our Future Planet' exhibition.Source: Euronews"

SHARES of Sembcorp Marine (Sembmarine) ended at S$0.079 on Friday (Oct 22), below the S$0.08 offer price set by Temasek in its mandatory general offer last month.
This comes as a media report on Thursday said that Sembmarine's work on the Johan Castberg vessel has been hit by ""serious manpower shortages"" due to the pandemic, and the project owner is set to transport the unfinished components from Singapore to Norway.
According to the report by trade publication Upstream, Norwegian energy company Equinor will transport the unfinished hull and turret for the Johan Castberg floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel to Norway, due to delays and escalating costs. These components were being built at Sembmarine's yard, the report said.
Sembmarine had secured its contract in 2017 with Equinor, previously known as Statoil. Worth US$490 million, the contract was for turnkey engineering, procurement and construction of hull and living quarters of the vessel, which is to be deployed in the Johan Castberg field in the Barents Sea.
An Equinor spokesperson cited in the report confirmed that the turret, which had been transported from Dubai to Singapore last year, will leave for Norway in December. The hull will be moved in early 2022.
Citing Equinor and contractor sources, the report said that Sembmarine's manpower difficulties mean that the turret installation phase will now be carried out at another yard in Stord, Norway. Equinor had originally planned to use 350,000 man-hours at Stord for the job, but the scope has now increased to 2.5 million man-hours, the report added.
Upstream's report comes as Temasek's offer for Sembmarine is set to close on Nov 3. The offer was triggered last month after Startree Investments, an indirect wholly owned unit of Temasek, announced that it will pick up 49.3 per cent of Sembmarine's rights issue, raising its stake in the company to 46.6 per cent.
The S$0.08 offer price is in line with the rights issue price. Startree intends to keep Sembmarine listed on the Singapore Exchange.
The Business Times has reached out to Sembmarine for comment. Shares of the mainboard-listed company were heavily traded on Friday, with some 57.3 million shares changing hands."

| Jump to first hitThe 4th GECF Annual Workshop in session virtually The cleanest of all the fossil fuels, natural gas, has entered its most defining moment as the world gets back to the twin ambitions of economic recovery and sustainable progress. This was the view shared by participants of the 4th GECF (Gas Exporting Countries Forum) Annual Workshop on Promotion of Natural Gas Demand. Welcoming the global audience connected virtually, Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the GECF (Gas Exporting Countries Forum), struck a message of unity in order to cement the role of natural gas in a low-carbon future. “There is no doubt that over the past year, natural gas proved its resilience and flexibility to deal with market fluctuations. However, the future of the industry is being guided by emotions and unfavourable energy policies towards fossil fuels, resulting in a lack of financing and investment across the value chain”. “Amidst these challenges, cooperation and dialogue amongst gas industry players, particularly between producers and consumers, is crucial for promoting natural gas, facilitating investment, reducing costs, and optimising operations across the entire gas value chain,” contended Sentyurin.This message has assumed poignancy given that in 2021 thus far, the gas industry has witnessed significant recovery in spot prices, supported by several factors including an extremely cold winter, a hotter-than-usual summer, and global economic, increasing supply constraints. On September 28, natural gas price crossed the $1,000 mark for the first time ever, reaching $1,031 per 1,000 cubic meters for October future at the TTF Hub, once again validating the 18-member Forum’s long-held position on a balanced approach to the energy transition. Furthermore, higher spot prices risk reducing the competitiveness of natural gas against coal and may threaten gas’s market share, particularly in the power sector. In other remarks, the outlook for natural gas as a fuel of choice for economic resurgence and sustainability targets was highlighted by a distinguished line-up of international gas industry leaders and panellists including the Honourable Stuart Young, Minister of Energy and Energy Industries of Trinidad and Tobago, Kamal Abbasov, Deputy Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources of Azerbaijan, Joe M. Kang, President of International Gas Union, and NJ Ayuk, Executive Chairman of African Energy Chamber (AEC). Minister Young said: “We firmly believe that the role of natural gas is a critical one, both for Trinidad and Tobago and the world as a whole, as we aim to ensure that growing energy demands are met in a clean and sustainable manner.”Kang continued saying: “We must demonstrate that natural gas is part of the emissions and climate change solution. Natural gas today, and a portfolio of decarbonised gasses, including hydrogen, tomorrow will be the catalyst for and foundation of a more sustainable energy future. We should therefore not see climate purely as a challenge but as an opportunity – if dirtier fuels become politically or socially too expensive, then gas is primed to become the beneficiary. The climate debate should be seen as a positive driver for natural gas demand.”The keynote session was followed by three thematic panels, including on young voices, aimed at bringing together high-level experts from various segments of the energy industry. The scene-setting was provided by Eng Mahdjouba Belaifa, Head of Gas Market Analyses Department at the GECF, who elaborated extensively on fresh, actionable and forward-thinking perspectives on a wide variety of natural gas benefits in the energy transition and how it will meet the future energy needs of the planet.The debates featured top-management of Gazprom Export, the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, Equinor, ExxonMobil Qatar, TotalEnergies Qatar, Cheniere Energy, Qamar Energy, and International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL), as well as Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES), Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), and the Abdullah Bin Hamad Al-Attiyah International Foundation for Energy and Sustainable Development, who provided their perspectives on the role of natural gas in new and niche sectors and collaborative strategies to reduce carbon and methane emissions.Taking part in the first panel discussion, ‘Expansion of natural gas demand in niche sectors’, Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy said: “The current high gas and electricity prices in Europe and Asia demonstrate again the importance of assuring reliable gas supplies while decarbonising end-uses. Promoting switching from oil and coal to gas, scaling up carbon capture and storage, and converting gas to hydrogen are key tools in ensuring economic and environmental security.” Ahmed Osman, Regional Business Development Manager Middle East) at Equinor said: “Gas is the transition fuel for the low carbon future.”In the same panel, Mike Fulwood, Senior Research Fellow, OIES, noted: “If the gas industry is to remain relevant in the energy transition over the next 30 years then there is a need to invest early and heavily in carbon capture and storage.”Speaking in the second panel, entitled ‘Collaborative strategies to reduce carbon and methane emissions’, Jagir Baxi, Vice President & Ventures Manager for ExxonMobil Qatar, said: “I would like to thank the GECF for the opportunity to join distinguished colleagues across the world representing the senior government leadership, the energy industry, academia, and other important stakeholders to discuss the challenges and opportunities for the natural gas industry as all parties work together to achieve a lower carbon future and balance important economic and development needs of countries and communities.” Representing the views of an NOC, Mark Loquan, President of the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited, said: “The climate fight is intensifying, as it should, accelerating the adoption of clean energy technologies across the world. The NGC has prioritised many green agenda projects, to transition the companies into the business of sustainable energy and to support global climate goals,” whilst Howard Bevan, Director of Energy at the Al Attiyah Foundation, urged the participants to “seriously invest in the parts of the energy industry to which it will contribute post 2050”. For the first time in four editions, the event also heard from youngsters as students from Qatar University, Texas A&M University at Qatar, and Hamad Bin Khalifa University made several presentations. The Annual Workshop on Promotion of Natural Gas Demand is a premier industry event and is designed to empower professionals and observers in the field of gas market to gain a deeper understanding of the market conditions, look at the common challenges, and think collectively on ways to promote natural gas to enhance its prospects as the fuel of choice for sustainable development. -- TradeArabia News Service"

Surging gas and electricity costs are forcing European governments to discuss billions of euros in aid for households and suppliers, as concern mounts over a deepening winter energy crisis. EU energy ministers will meet this week to discuss national responses to soaring wholesale gas prices, amid concern that they will jeopardise Europe's postpandemic economic recovery and undermine Brussels' plans for ambitious but costly green reforms.
Italy is set to unveil a multibillioneuro support package for households. A person at the Italian finance ministry with direct knowledge said ""a plausible amount to tackle the issue [of soaring energy costs] could reach up to €4.5bn"".
Italy, which has already spent €1bn to intervene to cut consumer prices, covers more than two-thirds of its energy needs with imports. Rome's plans follow Spain's decision last week to raid what it says are energy companies' excess profits and provide tax breaks to consumers. Companies are expected to mount a legal challenge to the move, which has driven down share prices.
The UK government is also considering providing energy companies with emergency state-backed loans to take on unprofitable customers from failing smaller suppliers, and has admitted several suppliers could go bust in days.
France has announced a €100 subsidy for some 6m low-income households.
Equinor, the Norwegian statecontrolled oil major, said yesterday it would increase its gas supply to Europe by boosting production from two North
Sea fields from Friday. Equinor said it was looking at ways to boost exports.
""We believe that this is very timely as Europe is facing an unusually tight market for natural gas,"" said Helge Haugane, head of gas and power at Equinor. Norway is the biggest natural gas supplier of the EU behind Russia.
The surge in wholesale gas prices has been driven by falling storage capacity during a prolonged winter in Europe last year as well as lower natural gas exports from Russia to north-west Europe this year, ahead of the start-up of the politically controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia's Gazprom has fulfilled its long-term contracts but not made additional top-up sales available through Ukraine, while allowing its own storage facilities in Europe to fall to low levels.

| Jump to first hitSiemens Energy has secured a contract from Aker Solutions to supply the complete packages for the electrical transmission, distribution, and power management system (PMS) for the Troll West electrification project in the North Sea. The Troll field is operated by Equinor and contains considerable oil and gas reserves.A key objective of the Troll West electrification project is to reduce NOx and CO2 emissions by replacing existing gas turbine-driven generators and compressors on the Troll B and C facilities with power from shore. The plan is to supply electrical power to Equinor’s Troll B and Troll C semi-submersibles with a 65-km, 150-megawatt subsea transmission cable from the Kollsnes natural gas processing plant on the island of Ona.Equinor has communicated that they estimate that reducing the power from the gas turbines on the Troll B and Troll C facilities will reduce annual carbon emissions by approximately 500,000 tonnes – an amount equivalent to about 1% of all emissions from Norway. In addition, NOx emissions from the field will also be reduced by an estimated 1,700 tonnes per year.Siemens Energy’s scope of supply for the project includes a range of electrical equipment, including transformers, reactors, and switchgears. Siemens AG is also part of the project consortium and will provide static frequency converter systems, large-scale drive trains, and special frequency converters, which will allow power to flow bi-directionally for normal and island operation. The PMS provided by Siemens Energy will help maintain a safe balance between power demand and consumption, thus ensuring overall grid stability.""Siemens Energy has been working in the Troll Field for more than two decades and is proud to support Norway’s ambitions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% through 2030 and by 80-95% through 2050,"" said Jennifer Hooper, Senior Vice President, Industrial Applications Solutions for Siemens Energy. “Our ability to provide a large portion of the equipment package for this project, coupled with our electrification experience on other offshore platforms operated by Equinor, including Martin Linge, Johan Sverdrup, and Goliat, were key factors in the contract award and will ultimately reduce project execution risks,” stated Hooper.Installation and commissioning of the electrical equipment for the Troll West project are scheduled for 2022 – 2023, she added.-TradeArabia News Service"

| Jump to first hitAlan Fairweather Ardyne, the Aberdeen and Norway-based fishing, milling and casing recovery provider, and Norwegian energy company Equinor, have agreed a second joint industry project (JIP). It will develop a unique well decommissioning technology that will dramatically reduce the economic and environmental impacts of slot recovery and decommissioning.Equinor and Ardyne are jointly funding the £1 million ($1.39 million) project. Ardyne will manage all engineering, project management and onsite rig qualification testing before deployment for field trials.The new JIP follows an initial agreement between Ardyne and Equinor in 2018 for the initial design and development of the resonance technology.TITAN RS combines Ardyne’s field proven bottom hole assembly (BHA) systems with the new resonance tool to aid casing recovery by using resonance to reduce the pulling force required to free stuck casing. Successful trial wells have been completed recovering casing encased in settled solids.The system uses the novel and highly effective application of resonance or vibration technology as opposed to hammering to free stuck casing, allowing longer sections to be pulled more quickly from settled material in the well such as barrite sag or settled solids. Ardyne has proved resonance to be highly effective in loosening settled material surrounding the casing, with an approximate 30% reduction in pull force required. The vibrations remain isolated downhole and are not transferred to the rig floor.Compared to conventional rig systems, TITAN RS can provide up to 40% time efficiency savings for well abandonment, decommissioning and brownfield slot recovery projects through fewer runs and time downhole, with a resultant reduction in carbon emissions due to less rig time. The additional functionality means well clean up can be achieved as part of the recovery process without the need for additional trips in the well.When considering a single well scenario, Ardyne has calculated that an average rig time saving of more than 78 hours can be achieved. This would equal 136 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) avoided, 156.8MW hours of electricity and 13,807 gallons of diesel - the equivalent of removing 198 fully loaded trucks driving from Aberdeen to London.TITAN RS, which will be ready for full commercialisation in 12 months, is the latest addition to Ardyne’s Toolbox, a suite of technologies for casing recovery to save rig time and provide solutions to challenging operations.Alan Fairweather, CEO of Ardyne, said: “Equinor’s continued commitment to the development and enhancement of TITAN RS through their reinvestment in the system shows the trust they have in it to deliver a more cost effective and carbon reducing alternative to conventional casing recovery methods.“The process is proven. The ability to cut days off existing processes through the innovative use of resonance is compelling at a time when the industry is seeking to maximise efficiencies at every opportunity.“The environmental benefits of reduced carbon emissions through less time required on site are clear. In fact we have calculated that by using TITAN RS and reducing rig time we can avoid the CO2 equivalent of 198 fully loaded trucks driving from Aberdeen to London, depending on the well.”“Equinor has already identified wells offshore Norway for the commercial deployment of TITAN RS next year. We look forward to providing them with a unique and industry-leading method to reduce operational costs and carbon emissions.”Pål V. Hemmingsen, Task Leader Low-cost P&A Equinor said: “The benefits of TITAN RS match our ambitions to shape the future of energy. We have been impressed with Ardyne’s unique application of resonance as a force for good in reducing project time and carbon output associated with P&A and slot recovery operations. We look forward to full commercialisation of the system from this latest JIP with the company.” -- TradeArabia News ServiceCopyright 2021 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

May 31 -- Ministry of Mines and Energy, Government of Brazil issued the following news release:- The positive scenario for investments is the result of a business environment that strives for legal and regulatory security and predictability.Brazilian bioenergy policies are an international reference and Brazil will continue to expand its energy matrix, with investments in the order of R $ 400 billion planned for the next ten years. The information comes from the Minister of Mines and Energy, Bento Albuquerque, who stated, at the Brazil 2021 Investment Forum, held this Monday, 05/31, that Brazil, one of the richest countries in renewable resources for energy production, it is a great market for investments in energy.At the event, opened by President Jair Bolsonaro, the minister participated in the panel “Energy Transition in Brazil: Importance of Renewable Energies and Foreign Direct Investment”. Under the moderation of the CEO of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (ABEEólica), Élbia Gannoun, Bento Albuquerque emphasized the potential of the electrical matrix, which today has 85% of renewable sources, the energy matrix with 49%, and highlighted the wind energy that, in the Northeast and the South, it already accounts for almost 11% of energy generation.The president of the international energy company Equinor Brasil, based in Norway, Verônica Rezende Coelho, the CEO of the EDP Brasil holding company, João Marques da Cruz and the manager of the Infrastructure and Energy Sector of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) participated in the same panel. ), Jose Agustín Aguerre. For Verônica Coelho, “all peoples deserve to benefit and enjoy access to energy at stable and fair prices. Our challenge is to bring these benefits to all peoples, however, in a sustainable manner ”, declared the Equinor representative, who, at the time, announced investments in Brazil of more than 15 billion dollars by 2030.Positive scenarioThe minister highlighted that Brazil has made a relevant contribution to the prospect of a world without emissions in the future. And he recalled that, in the last two years, even in the face of a pandemic crisis, there were investments in the country in the order of US$ 30 billion from 17 countries in the energy and mining sector. “It is evidence that we have a favorable business environment for investments”, highlighted Bento Albuquerque.He highlighted the success of the auctions already carried out and reaffirmed the execution of those scheduled for 2021: ten auctions for electricity generation, two auctions for power transmission, three for oil and gas, and four auctions in the mining sector. “This positive investment scenario has occurred because we have a business environment that strives for legal and regulatory security and predictability”, emphasized Albuquerque.PlanningWhen talking about the future and energy transition, the minister highlighted the importance of planning. He recalled that Brazil has a Decennial Energy Plan (PDE), updated every year, and a 30-year National Energy Plan (PNE). He highlighted the studies related to green hydrogen and announced the presentation, in June, of the National Hydrogen Program, “considered the energy source of the future”. “Offshore wind is another frontier that presents itself, where we already have 32 gigawatts of projects, especially in the Northeast and South regions. By the end of the year, we will present a regulatory framework for this important energy source that Brazil will have as one of the pillars of its electrical matrix in the future ”, said Bento Albuquerque.The minister pointed out that the Brazilian government continues to work with determination in the modernization of the electricity sector and in energy auctions, and that the country will continue with oil exploration and production actions, ""all done with planning and with control of the planned action"". ""We are an attractive country for investments and we believe that by improving our governance and updating our regulatory frameworks, such as the new gas law and the modernization of the electricity sector, these investments will become much more attractive and we will be able to generate income, development and transform our abundance of natural resources into wealth for our society”, he declared.BIFThe Brazil 2021 Investment Forum (BIF) is an international event on attracting foreign investment to Brazil, organized by Apex-Brasil, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Federal Government, which will be held online on May 31 and June 1, 2021.Considered the largest foreign investment event in Latin America, the BIF will bring together federal and state government officials and executives from large companies in Brazil and the world, as well as representatives from academia, the press and opinion makers.In this edition, the Forum will highlight investment opportunities in strategic sectors, such as agribusiness, energy, infrastructure, innovation, health, and technology, among others.

New Bedford, Massachusetts, was once a wealthy centre of the energy industry, sending out ships to hunt sperm whales whose oil illuminated the lamps of the 19th century.
The small city is now among Massachusetts' poorest and seeking an energy renaissance — as a place to piece together parts for huge wind power complexes planned in ocean waters.
The White House is soon expected to approve Vineyard Wind, the first commercial scale offshore windpower project in the US. Assembling its 64 towering turbines would provide an economic jolt to New Bedford.
The project will also be an early test of President Joe Biden's aim to create ""good-paying, union jobs"" while driving US carbon emissions down by half in this decade, as pledged at his international climate summit last week.
Delivering well-paid jobs is a political prerequisite to Biden's goal of a carbonfree power sector by 2035. His agenda threatens fossil fuel workers who are generally paid more, and are more widely unionised, than workers in solar or wind power, according to data from the US Energy and Employment Report. Lasting energy policy changes are likely to need support in Congress, including from lawmakers such as Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal-rich West Virginia.
The Biden administration last month laid out a vision for 30 gigawatts of offshore wind to be installed by 2030, creating 77,000 jobs — about the same number of jobs that are connected to Europe's offshore wind sector, where 25GW of capacity is already installed, according to the trade association WindEurope.
""There is a huge opportunity in offshore wind,"" said Philip Jordan, a vicepresident at BW Research who studies energy employment. ""It is a big, big potential job creator.""
Most of the jobs are in building, rather than operating, wind facilities. A UMass Dartmouth analysis of the 800MW Vineyard Wind project estimated 83 per cent of the 1,180 full-time positions required would be temporary construction jobs.
Yet the total number of projects in the pipeline could provide years of construction work, Jordan said. East coast states have agreed almost 12GW of offshore wind power purchases from developers led by European companies such as Orsted of Denmark, Equinor of Norway and in the case of Vineyard Wind, a subsidiary of Iberdrola of Spain and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, enough to supply about 4m homes.
The states view offshore wind as more than just a source of clean electricity. They picked developers that featured plans to hire unionised labour, use locally manufactured parts and aid poor or polluted neighbourhoods.
Massachusetts utilities will buy the power from Vineyard Wind under terms set by a state law that contains no special labour contracts. The state's latest offshore wind bid solicitation gives 70 per cent weight to the price of energy and 30 per cent to economic benefits including pledges to use ports such as New Bedford, where wind turbine parts will be loaded on to vessels that shuttle to offshore construction sites.
New York took a different approach, cementing union jobs into law. The legislature this month passed a bill requiring renewable energy companies to sign contracts with construction unions or offer ""prevailing wages"" typically set by a union benchmark. Companies must promise not to meddle with union organising campaigns by signing ""labour peace"" agreements. Gary LaBarbera, president of the New York State Building & Construction Trades Council, praised the provisions, saying they would ensure well-trained, highly skilled workers would keep projects on schedule and on budget. ""I believe the cost impact will be neutral.""
It will take years to test his assertion in a state with historically high construc- tion costs for public works. New York will pay the first two contracted offshore projects a $25 a megawatt-hour premium above wholesale electricity prices, though the government said it would add less than a dollar a month to customer bills.
Gina McCarthy, the US national climate adviser, spoke in March of ""massive turbines that are actually manufactured in the United States"" and ""special ships that need to install these new structures"" to be built in US ports.
Leading turbine manufacturers General Electric, Siemens Gamesa and Vestas have no offshore wind plants in the US. The more than 800ft tall Haliade-X turbines selected by Vineyard Wind are made in France by GE, even though the company has headquarters in Boston.
With some turbine rotors longer than a football pitch, the size of offshore wind equipment could force investment in port cities to handle equipment too big to move over rails or roadways.
New York's contract terms led Equinor to choose the port in its capital of Albany for the manufacture of turbine towers for its Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects, which are jointly owned with BP. Prevailing wage and project labour agreement requirements will apply to the port, a spokeswoman said.
New Jersey intends to convert a quayside parcel into a ""wind port"" where equipment can be marshalled for Orsted's Ocean Wind and other projects. Germany-based EEW recently broke ground on manufacturing plant for turbine bases at a New Jersey river town known mainly for its oil refinery.
Shipping turbine components from shore to sea is complicated by a 101-year-old law known as the Jones Act, which requires all vessels travelling along the US coasts to be built and owned by a US company.
No wind turbine installation vessels meet this criterion, though the Virginiabased utility Dominion Energy has ordered one for $500m. In the interim, Vineyard Wind plans to hire union seafarers to pilot US-flagged feeder vessels from New Bedford to a Belgian-owned installation ship that will perch on legs standing on the sea floor.
""It's inefficient. Every time you handle these large components you're adding time, you're adding cost, you're adding safety requirements,"" said Jamie MacDonald, director of operations for Boston at energy consultancy Xodus.'There is a huge opportunity in offshore wind. It is a big, big potential job creator'

With some turbine rotors longer than a football pitch, the size of offshore wind equipment could force investment in port cities to handle equipment too big to move over rails or roadways.
New York's contract terms led Equinor to choose the port in its capital of Albany for the manufacture of turbine towers for its Empire Wind and Beacon Wind projects, which are jointly owned with BP. Prevailing wage and project labour agreement requirements will apply to the port, a spokeswoman said.
New Jersey intends to convert a quayside parcel into a ""wind port"" where equipment can be marshalled for Orsted's Ocean Wind and other projects. Germany-based EEW recently broke ground on manufacturing plant for turbine bases at a New Jersey river town known mainly for its oil refinery.
Shipping turbine components from shore to sea is complicated by a 101-year-old law known as the Jones Act, which requires all vessels travelling along the US coasts to be built and owned by a US company.
No wind turbine installation vessels meet this criterion, though the Virginiabased utility Dominion Energy has ordered one for $500m. In the interim, Vineyard Wind plans to hire union seafarers to pilot US-flagged feeder vessels from New Bedford to a Belgian-owned installation ship that will perch on legs standing on the sea floor.

New Bedford, Massachusetts, was once a wealthy centre of the energy industry, sending out ships to hunt sperm whales whose oil illuminated the lamps of the 19th century.
The small city is now among Massachusetts' poorest and seeking an energy renaissance — as a place to piece together parts for huge wind power complexes planned in ocean waters.
The White House is soon expected to approve Vineyard Wind, the first commercial scale offshore windpower project in the US. Assembling its 64 towering turbines would provide an economic jolt to New Bedford.
The project will also be an early test of President Joe Biden's aim to create ""good-paying, union jobs"" while driving US carbon emissions down by half in this decade, as pledged at his international climate summit last week.
Delivering well-paid jobs is a political prerequisite to Biden's goal of a carbonfree power sector by 2035. His agenda threatens fossil fuel workers who are generally paid more, and are more widely unionised, than workers in solar or wind power, according to data from the US Energy and Employment Report. Lasting energy policy changes are likely to need support in Congress, including from lawmakers such as Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal-rich West Virginia.
The Biden administration last month laid out a vision for 30 gigawatts of offshore wind to be installed by 2030, creating 77,000 jobs — about the same number of jobs that are connected to Europe's offshore wind sector, where 25GW of capacity is already installed, according to the trade association WindEurope.
""There is a huge opportunity in offshore wind,"" said Philip Jordan, a vicepresident at BW Research who studies energy employment. ""It is a big, big potential job creator.""
Most of the jobs are in building, rather than operating, wind facilities. A UMass Dartmouth analysis of the 800MW Vineyard Wind project estimated 83 per cent of the 1,180 full-time positions required would be temporary construction jobs.
Yet the total number of projects in the pipeline could provide years of construction work, Jordan said. East coast states have agreed almost 12GW of offshore wind power purchases from developers led by European companies such as Orsted of Denmark, Equinor of Norway and in the case of Vineyard Wind, a subsidiary of Iberdrola of Spain and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, enough to supply about 4m homes.
The states view offshore wind as more than just a source of clean electricity. They picked developers that featured plans to hire unionised labour, use locally manufactured parts and aid poor or polluted neighbourhoods.
Massachusetts utilities will buy the power from Vineyard Wind under terms set by a state law that contains no special labour contracts. The state's latest offshore wind bid solicitation gives 70 per cent weight to the price of energy and 30 per cent to economic benefits including pledges to use ports such as New Bedford, where wind turbine parts will be loaded on to vessels that shuttle to offshore construction sites.
New York took a different approach, cementing union jobs into law. The legislature this month passed a bill requiring renewable energy companies to sign contracts with construction unions or offer ""prevailing wages"" typically set by a union benchmark. Companies must promise not to meddle with union organising campaigns by signing ""labour peace"" agreements. Gary LaBarbera, president of the New York State Building & Construction Trades Council, praised the provisions, saying they would ensure well-trained, highly skilled workers would keep projects on schedule and on budget. ""I believe the cost impact will be neutral.""
It will take years to test his assertion in a state with historically high construc- tion costs for public works. New York will pay the first two contracted offshore projects a $25 a megawatt-hour premium above wholesale electricity prices, though the government said it would add less than a dollar a month to customer bills.
Gina McCarthy, the US national climate adviser, spoke in March of ""massive turbines that are actually manufactured in the United States"" and ""special ships that need to install these new structures"" to be built in US ports.

Oil companies have for decades made money by extracting carbon from the ground. Now they are trying to make money putting it back.
Energy giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC are pushing carbon capture and storage -- where carbon is gathered and buried underground -- as part of a drive to reduce both their own and their customers' emissions. Executives say the service could become a new source of income when the industry is grappling with how to adapt to a lower-carbon economy.
Oil companies have long captured carbon from their operations, albeit mostly to produce more oil. Now they want to retool that skill as a service they can sell to heavy-polluting industries like cement and steel, burying their carbon in the ground indefinitely for a fee, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Yet critics question the environmental benefits and high cost of such projects.
Last month, Shell, Total SE and Equinor ASA launched a joint venture to store carbon in a rock formation thousands of feet beneath the seabed off the coast of Norway. The state-backed Northern Lights project is set to be the first time companies outside the oil industry will be able to pay to have their carbon gathered and stored.
Exxon has said it plans to form a new business unit to commercialize carbon capture and storage, forecasting it could become a $2 trillion market by 2040. Chevron Corp. has formed partnerships on storage projects, while BP PLC is codeveloping storage projects in the U.K. and Australia.
Oil executives' sales pitch: We will provide your energy, then take back the carbon to minimize your footprint.
Carbon capture and storage ""is becoming a business rather than just a solution,"" Maarten Wetselaar, director of integrated gas, renewables and energy solutions at Shell, recently said, adding that the company plans to include carbon storage as ""part of an integrated energy package"" to energy customers.
Shell already captures and stores its own carbon at sites in Australia and Canada, and says it wants to develop additional commercial facilities.
The Norway project, set to start in 2024, already has waste company Fortum Oslo Varme SA and HeidelbergCement AG as customers. Shell says it has further interest from 10 other companies, including Microsoft Corp. and ArcelorMittal, although no binding contracts have been signed.
Most carbon-storage projects rely on government funding. Norway is covering about 80% of the $1.6 billion cost of the Northern Lights project, with the rest split equally between Shell, Equinor and Total.
Deployed since the 1970s, most of the 26 sites operating carbon capture today are focused on injecting carbon into wells to recover more oil, with a handful dedicated to storing carbon, according to the Global CCS Institute, a think tank that advocates the technology.
Carbon capture typically works through the use of chemicals, to which the carbon sticks, to filter out emissions from a source like fumes at a power plant.
In the early 2000s, governments saw carbon capture as a way to clean up electricity generated by fossil fuels, but the technology was held back by high costs. Recent moves by governments and companies to reduce emissions are rekindling interest in carbon capture beyond the energy industry.
A record 17 new carbon-capture projects were slated for development last year, according to the Global CCS Institute. Many are focused on hard-to-decarbonize sectors like steel and cement making, where manufacturing processes release carbon dioxide.
Some researchers say the technology isn't the most efficient way to reduce emissions. ""Transitioning energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels as well as planting trees and reducing deforestation is a much better way to address carbon emissions,"" said Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.

Shell and its partners haven't said how much carbon-capture services will cost, or what the potential profits could be, saying it depends on various factors including volumes.

The U.S. offers companies a tax credit of as much as $50 a metric ton of carbon captured, while the U.K., Norway and Australia have collectively committed billions of dollars of funding for carbon-capture projects.
A record 17 new carbon-capture projects were slated for development last year, according to the Global CCS Institute. Many are focused on hard-to-decarbonize sectors like steel and cement making, where manufacturing processes release carbon dioxide.
""If [energy companies] can now make the transition from using CCS for the oil and gas industry to selling it as a service to their customers and decarbonizing their own product you scale it up a lot more,"" said Irene Himona, an analyst at Société Générale.
Some researchers say the technology isn't the most efficient way to reduce emissions. ""Transitioning energy infrastructure away from fossil fuels as well as planting trees and reducing deforestation is a much better way to address carbon emissions,"" said Mark Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.
Mr. Jacobson, who has long advocated for renewable energy, said his 2019 analysis of a U.S. carbon-capture project found that it didn't reduce overall emissions and that air pollution increased because of the fuel required to power the technology.
Others worry the technology could be used by oil companies ""to pretend we can carry on doing what we're doing without actually changing,"" said Kingsmill Bond, a strategist at London-based think tank Carbon Tracker.
Oil executives say they expect the costs of carbon capture to fall over time and that the technology is among a range of the solutions for reducing emissions.
There are also concerns about whether storage sites could leak carbon. In Europe, public resistance to land-based storage has led to the use of aquifers and depleted gas fields in the North Sea.
In the Norway project, carbon will be transported by ship around the bottom of the country before being pumped offshore via a 68-mile pipeline and then injected into an aquifer under the seabed.
BP is working on a similar concept for a project it will operate in northeast England, where carbon will be collected from a gas-power plant and various industrial sites, then stored under the North Sea.
""We'll capture the carbon, we'll take it offshore, we'll stuff it underground,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney recently said of the project. ""Taking the carbon back is what I like to describe it as.""

Renewable energy assets are in a bubble that has led to a string of deals with ""crazy"" valuations, according to the chief executive of Total, one of the biggest oil and gas companies.
The warning from Patrick Pouyanné comes as the industry's heavyweights are caught between sustaining fossil fuel-based businesses that generate the bulk of both their profits and the cash for dividends, while facing louder calls to increase investment in clean energy.
Total is no exception. In a wide-ranging interview, Pouyanné said he wanted the group to be recognised not ""as an oil and gas company, but as an energy company"".
The Paris-based multinational has pledged billions in renewables investment, targeted net-zero emissions by 2050 and proposed renaming the company TotalEnergies, which its shareholders will vote on in May.
However, ""there is a bubble"" in the renewables sector, Pouyanné cautioned. Valuations that were often up to 25 times earnings were ""just crazy today"", the Total chief added, putting that down to the short supply of assets of a significant scale. They are ""too scarce"".
Total was one of several major oil companies, BP among them, that this month paid what one analyst described as ""staggering"" prices for the leases to UK offshore wind projects.
In a thinly veiled swipe at BP, which was part of the highest-bidding consortium, he said: ""When we come, we don't pay too much.""
With European oil and gas companies under particular pressure to steer their portfolios towards cleaner forms of energy, Pouyanné was not shocked at the frenzy over renewables as sellers seek out the deepest pockets.
""I will not buy, but I think I would not be surprised to see one of my European peers spending money,"" he said. ""A banker came to me [about another deal] and said 'If you don't buy it, BP will buy it'. I said, OK, but at this price, why should I buy that? Explain it to me.""
BP's Dev Sanyal, who is responsible for its alternative energy business, said last week that value was the ""key driver"" when the group did deals and that it would not just invest in any asset to meet renewable targets.
In a sign of the escalating pressure on the sector, major institutional investors have threatened to ditch their stakes in oil and gas companies altogether unless they do more to combat climate change.
Pouyanné, who has spent more than two decades at Total and took over days after the death of his predecessor Christophe de Margerie in a plane crash in 2014, admitted public sentiment had shifted faster than anyone in the industry imagined just a few years ago.
But the 57-year-old decried as a ""paradox"" the view that ""we will solve the climate change challenge just because there is no more equity invested in oil and gas majors, that's something completely wrong"".
""Even if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,"" added Pouyanné, arguing that selling assets to other producers who may be less mindful does little to help.
State-owned oil companies, including the likes of Saudi Aramco or the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ""are not prepared to stop producing"" and if Total cuts back then ""Russian companies say, 'all that is quite good for us' because they will get the asset.""
Although the pandemic left Total with a loss of $7.2bn last year as oil prices slumped, the group has ploughed ahead with its net-zero plan.
Despite Pouyanné's unease over valuations, renewables — chiefly solar and wind — are a big part of the group's future. While Total and BP are prioritising low-carbon power generation, Shell is focusing on selling electricity instead.
The French group has said it would spend more than $2bn this year on electricity and clean energy, seeking 10 per cent returns on the investments.
It aims to generate more than $1.5bn in cash flow from its renewables operations in 2025, up from about $100m prepandemic in 2019. However, this is still a fraction of the $27bn in cash flow from operations it generated that year, largely from its traditional businesses.
The group has paid $2.5bn for a 20 per cent stake in Adani Green Energy and a slice of its solar business, deepening its presence in India. It has also bought solar and energy projects in Texas, and with Engie is developing the largest site in France for the production of green hydrogen. The Adani investment ""will probably be the only [big] deal we can do"" this year, Pouyanné said.
The Normandy-born chief executive runs Total with a firm grip, both managing day-to-day operations and stitching together some of its biggest deals with little help from bankers or his top executives — such as the $7.5bn acquisition of mostly North Sea oil assets from Denmark's Maersk in 2017.
The former rugby player went to the École Polytechnique and then the École des Mines in Paris, a top engineering school, making him what the French refer to as one of the ""X-Mines"" who have a large role in running the country's industrial base.
Pouyanné is unapologetic about the need to develop Total's fossil fuel businesses to help generate the cash for green investments. The group expects its oil production to remain stable, but its gas business is growing. The $1.5bn acquisition of liquefied natural gas assets from Engie in 2017 catapulted Total to number two in the global market behind Shell.
Unlike BP, which plans to shrink its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent, Pouyanné is warier about diluting the group's traditional business. ""If you lose part of your source of cash and you are not able to finance your development, then you have an imbalance,"" he said.
Even as oil prices crumbled last year, Total, which has 100,000 employees spanning more than 130 countries, was the only European oil major to keep its dividend intact. Its stock tumbled 29 per cent last year, but fared better than many peers.
""If an oil and gas major is not able to go through cycles, I don't know what we are able to offer our investors,"" said Pouyanné.
Total had a stronger balance sheet and lower debt levels than peers before the pandemic ""which put less pressure on executives to do something about the dividend"", said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
""Still, it has not gone unscathed through each downturn. Equity investors have been diluted on multiple occasions, including from issuing discounted shares and hybrid bonds,"" he added.
In a period of both promise and peril for oil supermajors, Total has dismissed the suggestion by bankers of splitting off its renewables arm as a separate listed company, believing its clean energy business will still need the financial firepower currently provided by fossil fuels. While a firm believer in renewables, the Total chief said the narrative over the shift to greener energy needs more nuance, pointing to the lack of debate among politicians and environmentalists over how much it will cost consumers.
""We have to face the reality that there is something wrong in the political debate,"" said Pouyanné.
""People think it's renewable so it should be free.""

The $1.5bn acquisition of liquefied natural gas assets from Engie in 2017 catapulted Total to number two in the global market behind Shell.
Unlike BP, which plans to shrink its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent, Pouyanné is warier about diluting the group's traditional business. ""If you lose part of your source of cash and you are not able to finance your development, then you have an imbalance,"" he said.
Even as oil prices crumbled last year, Total, which has 100,000 employees spanning more than 130 countries, was the only European oil major to keep its dividend intact. Its stock tumbled 29 per cent last year, but fared better than many peers.
""If an oil and gas major is not able to go through cycles, I don't know what we are able to offer our investors,"" said Pouyanné.
Total had a stronger balance sheet and lower debt levels than peers before the pandemic ""which put less pressure on executives to do something about the dividend"", said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
""Still, it has not gone unscathed through each downturn. Equity investors have been diluted on multiple occasions, including from issuing discounted shares and hybrid bonds,"" he added.

2503044968,"Feb 18, 2021",Total chief warns of renewable energy bubble: Pouyanné says supermajors are paying 'crazy' prices for scarce green assets as they respond to pressure from investors [Europe Region],https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/total-chief-warns-renewable-energy-bubble/docview/2503044968/se-2?accountid=7064,EQNR,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

Renewable energy assets are in a bubble that has led to a string of deals with ""crazy"" valuations, according to the chief executive of Total, one of the biggest oil and gas companies.
The warning from Patrick Pouyanné comes as the industry's heavyweights are caught between sustaining fossil fuel-based businesses that generate the bulk of both their profits and the cash for dividends, while facing louder calls to increase investment in clean energy.
Total is no exception. In a wide-ranging interview, Pouyanné said he wanted the group to be recognised not ""as an oil and gas company, but as an energy company"".
The Paris-based multinational has pledged billions in renewables investment, targeted net-zero emissions by 2050 and proposed renaming the company TotalEnergies, which its shareholders will vote on in May.
However, ""there is a bubble"" in the renewables sector, Pouyanné cautioned. Valuations that were often up to 25 times earnings were ""just crazy today"", the Total chief added, putting that down to the short supply of assets of a significant scale. They are ""too scarce"".
Total was one of several major oil companies, BP among them, that this month paid what one analyst described as ""staggering"" prices for the leases to UK offshore wind projects.
In a thinly veiled swipe at BP, which was part of the highest-bidding consortium, he said: ""When we come, we don't pay too much.""
With European oil and gas companies under particular pressure to steer their portfolios towards cleaner forms of energy, Pouyanné was not shocked at the frenzy over renewables as sellers seek out the deepest pockets.
""I will not buy, but I think I would not be surprised to see one of my European peers spending money,"" he said. ""A banker came to me [about another deal] and said 'If you don't buy it, BP will buy it'. I said, OK, but at this price, why should I buy that? Explain it to me.""
BP's Dev Sanyal, who is responsible for its alternative energy business, said last week that value was the ""key driver"" when the group did deals and that it would not just invest in any asset to meet renewable targets.
In a sign of the escalating pressure on the sector, major institutional investors have threatened to ditch their stakes in oil and gas companies altogether unless they do more to combat climate change.
Pouyanné, who has spent more than two decades at Total and took over days after the death of his predecessor Christophe de Margerie in a plane crash in 2014, admitted public sentiment had shifted faster than anyone in the industry imagined just a few years ago.
But the 57-year-old decried as a ""paradox"" the view that ""we will solve the climate change challenge just because there is no more equity invested in oil and gas majors, that's something completely wrong"".
""Even if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,"" added Pouyanné, arguing that selling assets to other producers who may be less mindful does little to help.
State-owned oil companies, including the likes of Saudi Aramco or the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, ""are not prepared to stop producing"" and if Total cuts back then ""Russian companies say, 'all that is quite good for us' because they will get the asset.""
Although the pandemic left Total with a loss of $7.2bn last year as oil prices slumped, the group has ploughed ahead with its net-zero plan.
Despite Pouyanné's unease over valuations, renewables — chiefly solar and wind — are a big part of the group's future. While Total and BP are prioritising low-carbon power generation, Shell is focusing on selling electricity instead.
The French group has said it would spend more than $2bn this year on electricity and clean energy, seeking 10 per cent returns on the investments.
It aims to generate more than $1.5bn in cash flow from its renewables operations in 2025, up from about $100m prepandemic in 2019. However, this is still a fraction of the $27bn in cash flow from operations it generated that year, largely from its traditional businesses.
The group has paid $2.5bn for a 20 per cent stake in Adani Green Energy and a slice of its solar business, deepening its presence in India. It has also bought solar and energy projects in Texas, and with Engie is developing the largest site in France for the production of green hydrogen. The Adani investment ""will probably be the only [big] deal we can do"" this year, Pouyanné said.
The Normandy-born chief executive runs Total with a firm grip, both managing day-to-day operations and stitching together some of its biggest deals with little help from bankers or his top executives — such as the $7.5bn acquisition of mostly North Sea oil assets from Denmark's Maersk in 2017.
The former rugby player went to the École Polytechnique and then the École des Mines in Paris, a top engineering school, making him what the French refer to as one of the ""X-Mines"" who have a large role in running the country's industrial base.
Pouyanné is unapologetic about the need to develop Total's fossil fuel businesses to help generate the cash for green investments. The group expects its oil production to remain stable, but its gas business is growing.

| Jump to first hit Aker Solutions has secured a contract worth billions of dollars from Equinor for the topside work on the Troll B and C platforms offshore Norway to reduce the CO2 emissions.These modifications will include installation of equipment for receiving electrical power from shore via cable. This will replace power generation from gas turbines at the platforms, and thus reduce climate footprint.Aker Solutions’ work will include engineering, procurement, construction and prefabrication of systems, and installation at the platforms offshore.The engineering and construction will be performed at Aker Solutions’ offices in Bergen, and at its yard in Egersund respectively. The award follows completion of the front-end engineering and design (FEED) work that Aker Solutions was awarded in January 2020. The work will start immediately and is scheduled for completion at the end of 2025. The scope will include approximately 1,000 man-years for own employees, of which about 500 for engineering, 200 for construction and 300 for the work offshore. Including ripple effects, the scope is expected to involve a total of 4,000 people, including employees working with suppliers, services providers etc. “Reduction of climate footprint is high on the agenda for our customers in the oil and gas industry. Electrification of production platforms is one of the ways to reduce emissions from such operations. Aker Solutions has extensive experience from delivering such low-carbon solutions, and we aim to be a leading contractor in this market. We are excited to collaborate with Equinor on the Troll electrification,” said Kjetel Digre, chief executive officer of Aker Solutions. The Troll field lies about 65 km west of Bergen on Norway’s west coast. The electrical power cable will be connected to shore at Kollsnes outside Bergen. --Tradearabia News ServiceCopyright 2021 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

On Wall Street, most analysts hate surprises, favoring companies with steady predictable earnings growth. Not James Gautrey and Simon Webber.
The co-managers of the Hartford Schroders International Stock fund (ticker: SCIEX) seek ""unanticipated growth,"" Gautrey says. ""We call it a growth gap. For us, one of the best sources of consistent alpha [or outperformance] is in earnings surprises, where we can take a differentiated view to the market.""
Their strategy works. The $1.9 billion fund's 16.1% five-year annualized return beats 98% of its peers in Morningstar's Foreign Large Blend category. Its 7.6% 10-year number beats 95%. The fund has done this with comparable volatility to its peers and benchmark, MSCI ACWI Ex USA. And it has an 0.85% expense ratio, below-average for the foreign stock category, in its institutional share-class, which can be purchased for $2,000.
Of course, any stock would benefit from a positive earnings surprise. The challenge is figuring out which companies will have such surprises—before they occur. To do that, you must have the analytical capabilities to figure out what the Street's analysts and the market are missing. The fund employs 11 global sector specialists who refine the stock recommendations of Schroders' more than 100 global equity analysts. Gautrey, 41, and Webber, 47, then make the final investment calls. Webber is lead manager of Schroders' Global and International Equities team, and oversees some $30 billion, but Gautrey is lead manager of this particular fund.
The fund distinguishes itself from other Schroders funds by being concentrated; it currently holds about 50 stocks. ""It's the most concentrated form of our international equity strategy,"" Webber says, ""the best ideas we have as a team.""
The portfolio falls into two buckets, Gautrey explains: core stocks and opportunistic stocks. Core stocks, which usually make up 60% to 70% of the portfolio's assets, ""are high-return-on-invested-capital businesses with structural competitive advantages and good management teams.""
The so-called opportunistic names—a company experiencing a turnaround, say—make up the rest of the portfolio. ""These are shorter-term holdings, where, again, we see an earnings-growth gap, a difference versus consensus [analyst expectations],"" he says. It's not that the managers disregard the short term in picking their core stocks, but ""the compounding effect of those high-quality businesses is what the market often underestimates in the long term.""
One core stock is Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), which the fund purchased toward the end of 2019, though Gautrey had been investigating it for over a decade. His reservation: ""Politics and macroeconomics in Latin America can be pretty volatile."" But Mercado's management team impressed him over time. ""They managed through everything—amazing currency devaluations, overturning of governments, [government] debt defaults.""
Mercado has distinct advantages over comparable e-commerce players. First, e-commerce penetration in Latin America is a fraction of that in the U.S., roughly around 3%, Gautrey says. Mercado also has built out its warehouse, trucking, and delivery infrastructure—much like Amazon.com (AMZN), but with one key distinction. ""Particularly when you go into emerging markets, relying on the nationalized postal infrastructure can mean a delivery takes several days to arrive,"" Gautrey says. ""Building out your own logistics infrastructure can dramatically improve the consumer experience. And then having that infrastructure also acts as a barrier to entry for [competitors]."" The stock is up 178% in the past year, yet Gautrey thinks the market continues to underestimate its potential.
Among the fund's opportunistic plays is Equinor (EQNR), a Norwegian energy company, which has a negative 2.2% three-year annualized return. The team began looking at the stock last April, in the pandemic crash, and bought the stock in May when oil was about $40 a barrel. One argument for the stock was ""that $60 oil was likely, as soon as we get economic normalization again,"" Webber says. Oil is now at $59.
But the less-understood opportunity in Equinor involves alternative energy. Equinor conducts oil exploration on the shallow Norwegian continental shelf. But ""it's also very well-suited for offshore wind [farms],"" Webber explains. ""We found the development of [Equinor's] expertise in offshore wind is really flying below the radar screen."" Also, Norway is investing heavily in alternative hydrogen fuel and carbon-capture programs, and Equinor has ""leading expertise"" in both areas, Webber says. ""That will position them to be one of the few incumbents that are able to transition away from being too reliant on fossil fuel business,"" he says. But Equinor is only a temporary play as the fossil fuel industry as a whole is in ""secular decline,"" he adds.
Sometimes core and opportunity stocks can be in the same sector. Some of the biggest opportunities the team has found recently have been in the financial sector—18% of the fund's portfolio. The fund has opportunistic plays in European banks, such as Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.Italy) and Sweden's Svenska Handelsbanken (SHBA.Sweden), purchased during the stock market's 2020 slide. ""These are more shorter-term holdings, where I think loan losses are overestimated,"" Gautrey says.
In contrast, the fund has held core Asian financial plays —India's HDFC Bank (HDB) and Hong Kong insurer AIA Group (1299.Hong Kong)—for years. Growth rates in financial services are better in Asia, where a burgeoning middle class is increasingly embracing banking and insurance.
AIA ""is probably the world's best-run life insurer,"" and HDFC Bank is ""one of the best-run banks,"" Gautrey says. Those are the kind of companies where the surprise isn't that they are currently doing well, but just how well they will do over time.

Off the east coast of Scotland, in water more than 300 feet deep, five towering turbines weighing thousands of tons float in the North Sea. Installed in 2017, the turbines power about 36,000 homes a year.
Wind farms have been erected on land and at sea for decades, but Hywind Scotland, operated by Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA, is the first to float. Instead of being inserted into steel tubes buried in the seabed, the turbines sit in cylindrical buoys that are fixed to the seabed by mooring lines. The approach promises to enable wind farms in much deeper water, where there are often stronger winds, opening up swaths of untapped coastline to renewable energy.
Equinor believes that there are many countries where floating wind could be the best option for generating renewable power. In some places, such as Japan, South Korea and the U.S., a steep drop off the continental shelf means the water is too deep for fixed wind turbines, which are limited to depths of around 60 meters, or just under 200 feet.
The technology is gaining interest as governments scramble to reduce their carbon emissions footprint. The 2015 Paris climate accord, where governments agreed to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius, with an ambition to cap them at 1.5 degrees Celsius, has focused attention on limiting emissions, which renewable energy helps address.
Still, floating wind is almost double the cost of fixed offshore wind, which needs an average price of $84 per megawatt-hour of electricity for projects to break even, according to industry group the Global Wind Energy Council. There are dozens of concepts for floating platforms in the works, preventing the savings that come with standardization and mass production. Longer cables needed to send power back to land can also increase expenses. The internal rate of return, a measure of profitability of investments, is around 10% for fixed wind and not yet known for floating wind.
Another limitation is the slow pace at which governments are developing policy to enable projects.
""We will start with where you see an appetite from government and where you see an energy need that cannot be met by obvious, much cheaper options like onshore wind, solar and to some degree fixed offshore wind,"" says Sebastian Bringsvaerd, head of floating wind development at Equinor.
Some governments are realizing that floating wind may be their only option for meeting carbon reduction targets, particularly if they have limited space for solar and wind projects onshore, Mr. Bringsvaerd says. Whether fixed or floating, wind farms in the sea don't face as much public resistance over their impact on the environment and landscape. They are not visible from shore when they are farther than 30 miles out. Cables can be buried all the way to the power station, but this can be more difficult if the cable lands ashore in a residential area.
Some oil-and-gas companies seeking to expand in renewable energy see floating wind as a natural extension of their expertise, having spent years building floating oil and gas facilities to extract fossil fuels from deep beneath the seabed.
Energy giants including France's Total SE and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have invested, consistent with their plans to reduce dependence on oil and ramp up spending on low-carbon energy. Shell bought Paris-based floating wind specialist Eolfi SA in 2019. Utilities already active in wind energy are also testing floating technologies, including Spain's Iberdrola SA and Germany's RWE Group. Both companies are involved in single-turbine pilot projects due to start up in Europe in the next two years.
There are plenty of opportunities to pursue. Countries including Japan, South Korea, the U.K., Spain and some states in the U.S. are planning for floating wind projects off their shorelines. Some regions are setting offshore wind targets, including the European Union, which aims for capacity to grow fivefold to 60 gigawatts by 2030. Some of this will need to come from floating wind, according to Equinor.
""The low hanging fruit of fixed-bottom wind has been picked,"" says Bruno Geschier, chief sales and marketing officer at France's Ideol SA, which designs and builds floating foundations for turbines. The company's technology has been used in France and Japan since 2018 in single-turbine pilot projects.
President Biden's move to return the U.S. to the Paris agreement and plans to boost green energy investment have also spurred optimism in floating wind.
""The willingness of governments to make sites available is key, that has been one of the restrictions of the development of the U.S. market,"" says Joao Metelo, chief executive of California-based Principle Power Inc., which designs and makes floating platforms.
The company has developed a three-column semi-submersible platform which helps distribute the weight of the turbine and stabilize it. The company is considering future projects including at water depths of over 3,000 feet. In 2018, California's Redwood Coast Energy Authority selected a consortium including Principle Power, Norwegian oil-services company Aker Solutions AS, and the renewables unit of Portugal's largest utility Energias de Portugal SA, to enter into a public-private partnership for a proposed floating wind project.
The wind blows harder and more consistently farther from shore, which means that floating offshore wind projects have the potential to generate more power than fixed-wind projects. In 2019 Equinor's Hywind Scotland project achieved 55% of its potential power capacity. This compares with fixed offshore wind projects which average 29% to 52%, while solar photovoltaic is less than half of that, according to the International Energy Agency.
""Around 60-80% of the best wind resources near centers for demand are in areas where the water is deeper than 60 meters,"" says Ideol's Mr. Geschier.
A handful of commercial scale floating wind farms are expected to start up by 2025, including in Spain, Italy and South Korea, according to GWEC.
One of those is Hywind Tampen, an Equinor project off the coast of Norway to power some of the company's offshore oil and gas platforms from next year. Equinor is using technology where the floating cylindrical buoy the wind turbine sits in is weighted so that the entire construction floats upright.
Later this year, governments are expected to auction areas for seabed development, and floating-wind proposals are likely off the coasts of France, South Korea, Norway and elsewhere, due to the water depth.
As project size increases, costs are expected to fall.
Henrik Stiesdal, chair of GWEC's floating offshore wind task force, expects that within the next decade floating-wind costs are likely to match fixed-wind turbines, aided by the same subsidy schemes which helped cut costs for fixed turbines.
""The main thing that will make floating wind reduce in price and really cost competitive is volume,"" says Mr. Stiesdal.

In 2018, California's Redwood Coast Energy Authority selected a consortium including Principle Power, Norwegian oil-services company Aker Solutions AS, and the renewables unit of Portugal's largest utility Energias de Portugal SA, to enter into a public-private partnership for a proposed floating wind project.
The wind blows harder and more consistently farther from shore, which means that floating offshore wind projects have the potential to generate more power than fixed-wind projects. In 2019 Equinor's Hywind Scotland project achieved 55% of its potential power capacity. This compares with fixed offshore wind projects which average 29% to 52%, while solar photovoltaic is less than half of that, according to the International Energy Agency.

""Around 60-80% of the best wind resources near centers for demand are in areas where the water is deeper than 60 meters,"" says Ideol's Mr. Geschier.
A handful of commercial scale floating wind farms are expected to start up by 2025, including in Spain, Italy and South Korea, according to GWEC.
One of those is Hywind Tampen, an Equinor project off the coast of Norway to power some of the company's offshore oil and gas platforms from next year. Equinor is using technology where the floating cylindrical buoy the wind turbine sits in is weighted so that the entire construction floats upright.
Later this year, governments are expected to auction areas for seabed development, and floating-wind proposals are likely off the coasts of France, South Korea, Norway and elsewhere, due to the water depth.
As project size increases, costs are expected to fall.
Henrik Stiesdal, chair of GWEC's floating offshore wind task force, expects that within the next decade floating-wind costs are likely to match fixed-wind turbines, aided by the same subsidy schemes which helped cut costs for fixed turbines.
""The main thing that will make floating wind reduce in price and really cost competitive is volume,"" says Mr. Stiesdal.

BP stock fell early on Tuesday, as the oil major's profit plunged 96% in the fourth quarter on the way to its first annual loss in a decade.
The FTSE 100-listed company reported a full year loss of $5.7 billion, down from a profit of $10 billion in 2019, as it rounded off a tough 2020 with another difficult quarter. BP said the annual loss, its first since 2010, was driven by lower oil and gas prices, exploration write-offs and depressed demand. The London-listed shares fell 3%, while BP ADR shares were 4.3% lower in premarket trading.
The final three months of the year saw the return of tight Covid-19 restrictions and travel bans across the world, as new strains of the virus that causes the disease began to emerge and spread rapidly.

19 Stocks That Could Be a Buying Opportunity After Last Week's Drop

BP reported an underlying replacement cost profit—its definition of net income—of $115 million in the three months to Dec. 31, compared with $2.6 billion the previous year and significantly below the FactSet analyst consensus of $355 million.
Things are unlikely to get better in the short term, as BP warned the pandemic would continue to hit performance at the start of 2021.
""We expect renewed Covid-19 restrictions to have a greater impact on product demand, with January retail volumes down by around 20% year on year, compared with a decline of 11% in the fourth quarter,"" the company said. Net debt, which stood at $39 billion at the year-end is expected to increase in the first half of 2021, before falling later in the year, it added—on track to meet its $35 billion target by the first quarter of 2022.
The world's largest oil-and-gas companies endured a difficult 2020 as the Covid-19 pandemic decimated global demand. BP, along with its rival Royal Dutch Shell recorded heavy losses, particularly in the second quarter. Shell cut its dividend
for the first time since World War II
, while BP also slashed payouts for the first time in a decade.

BP Enters Offshore Wind Market With $1.1 Billion Equinor Deal

However, the sector's plight has also served to accelerate its shift toward green energy and a low carbon future. BP, Total and Shell all ramped up their strategies, targeting being net zero on carbon by 2050. In September, BP agreed to buy 50% stakes in two wind farm developments from Norway's Equinor in a $1.1 billion deal, and in November it
launched a green hydrogen project
with Danish energy giant Ørsted. On Monday, the company sold a 20% stake in Oman's Block 61 gas field for $2.6 billion, as it moved more than halfway to its $25 billion divestment plan by 2025.
Looking ahead. Redburn analyst Stuart Joyner said it was a ""challenging"" end to the year for BP. ""Operating cash flow remains very weak and missed expectations. We will likely see net debt worsen in Q1, which will temper expectations of better shareholder distributions,"" he said.
The prospect of the Covid-19 pandemic's impact lasting through at least the first quarter is both disappointing and expected for investors. BP's lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit is just disappointing and illustrates the battle ahead. But it isn't all doom and gloom, as the company aims to position itself at the forefront of the green energy revolution in the long term.
The shorter term may be more tricky, as the company admits, but BP anticipates an oil demand recovery in 2021, echoing the predictions of many. It added that oil prices have risen since October. The London-listed stock, which fell 46% in 2020 and has followed a similar pattern to the ADRs, has rallied in recent months, climbing 57% between the end of October and mid-January.
However, it has now fallen around 20% since mid-January—with the ADRs falling 13% in the same period—and IG chief market analyst Chris Beauchamp said the shares may now be a bargain. ""A global oil titan is not exactly everyone's idea of deep value, but it is not hard to argue that 2021 will be a much better year than its predecessor, and so perhaps BP is now due for a fresh rally, especially thanks to the ongoing strength in the oil price,"" he said.

| Jump to first hit Corvus Energy, a global pioneer in energy storage, is set to start development and production of sustainable, large scale maritime-certified hydrogen fuel cell systems with Toyota as key partner and supplier of mass-produced fuel cell technology.Corvus is spearheading a collaboration with Norwegian partners Equinor, shipowners Norled and Wilhelmsen, ship design company LMG Marin, the NCE Maritime CleanTech cluster and R&D institution the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) to develop and produce modularised and cost-effective PEM (Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel-cell systems for the international marine market.The project has received EUR 5.2 million in funding from state agency Innovation Norway bolstering Corvus’ front-runner position in clean technology for maritime and other sectors. The development is scheduled to showcase its first marine fuel cell system onboard a vessel in 2023 and the product will be marine certified and available for commercial delivery from 2024.The initiative combines Norwegian maritime expertise together with fuel cell modules supplied by one of the world’s largest fuel-cell producers Toyota, who has 30 years’ experience in the development and production of fuel cells for the car market and other land-based applications.The agreement with Toyota secures Corvus access to proven fuel cell technology while enabling large-scale production and competitive pricing. The production will be Norway’s first of its kind, strengthening the country’s pole position in the global efforts towards decarbonizing shipping.Interest in hydrogen for maritime applications has been increasing rapidly, with hydrogen power seen as an important step to reach shipping’s ambitious goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050. Reducing the cost of fuel cells and increasing access to the technology is crucial to accelerate the transition.The initiative represents an important step towards achieving both goals by producing modularised systems not available on a large scale today. The Corvus-Toyota partnership will become a strong player enabling a significant increase in capacity of marine fuel cells to the market.“Adding fuel cell modules to our product portfolio is a natural step for Corvus and advances our vision to be the leading supplier of zero-emission marine solutions. Fuel cell technology has reached a maturity level where scale-up of systems will be the next step. Toyota is in the forefront of the development and is by far the best partner for us to make this a success,” said Corvus Energy CEO Geir Bjørkeli. “Decarbonisation is inevitable and at Toyota, we are convinced that hydrogen will play a central role in creating a better future, both environmentally and economically. Our recently established Fuel Cell Business group in Brussels is looking forward to working with Corvus Energy and the consortium members to offer fuel cell solutions for marine applications. This project will play an important role in the development of the Hydrogen Society,” said Thiebault Paquet, Director of the Fuel Cell Business Group at Toyota Motor Europe.Corvus’ new dedicated fuel cell division will design and certify the marine fuel cell system using the Toyota fuel cell technology as a building block for larger systems. Furthermore, a specific marine control system uniting the battery and fuel cell operation will be developed for easy integration with power management systems from a range of system integrators.Backed by strong owners in the form of Norsk Hydro, Equinor, Shell and BW Group, Corvus plans to scale up production to mirror its world-leading position in battery systems. The development partners USN and NCE Maritime CleanTech will contribute knowledge within hydrogen safety, while Equinor, Norled, Wilhelmsen and LMG Marin will bring key experience from ongoing hydrogen projects. – TradeArabia News ServiceCopyright 2021 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

| Jump to first hitNorway's Equinor ASA is pulling up stakes in Calgary and moving staff across the country to St. John's as the company is no longer interested in Western Canada's oil and gas opportunities and will focus on offshore projects in Atlantic Canada.
""The decision to consolidate offices was made to improve organizational efficiencies in our Canadian business and align with our updated Canada business strategy,"" Equinor Canada Ltd. spokesperson Alex Collins said in an emailed statement, adding the company is also laying off about 30 per cent of its 120-person Canadian workforce. The Oslo-based oil producer, formerly known as Statoil, is closing its office in Calgary this month and relocating staff to St. John's as the company refocuses future spending on its offshore oil business on the East Coast. Equinor will keep a small oil marketing and trading team in Calgary.
""Equinor previously divested our Western Canadian assets (in 2017), and will no longer evaluate business opportunities in the onshore energy industry in Canada,"" Collins said, referring to its sale of its oilsands asset to Athabasca Oil Corp., which closed in 2017 and was valued at $832 million at the time.
The company owns a minority stake in the Terra Nova, Hebron and Hibernia offshore projects in Newfoundland and Labrador in addition to operating in seven other non-producing offshore licences in the Atlantic province. In October, the company announced it had made hydrocarbon discoveries at two wells drilled on its Cappahayden and Cambriol prospects in the Flemish Pass Basin in the Atlantic, but it did not release estimates of how much oil it could produce from the formations.
Collins said the company announced ""an ongoing efficiency project"" in its international businesses in August and its decision to leave Calgary is part of this cost-cutting initiative.
Equinor is among a handful of European oil producers including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and BP PLC to sell its oilsands holdings and refocus its efforts elsewhere.
However, it is one of the few international companies to divest from the oilsands to continue looking at additional projects in Canada.
""This is definitely an interesting case,"" said Joseph Marchand, associate professor of economics at the University of Alberta, who noted that in years past Alberta has drawn workers from Newfoundland and Labrador rather than sending workers the other way. St. John's had an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent in December, according to Statistics Canada, compared with Calgary's 10.9 per cent. At the provincial level, Newfoundland and Labrador continues to suffer a higher unemployment rate, at 12.5 per cent, than Alberta, which sits at 10.9 per cent.
Marchand said that Alberta continues to benefit from an influx of international immigration, but inter-provincial in-migration to the Prairie province has slowed dramatically.
Marchand said Equinor consolidating offices in St. John's is ""a smart move"" given that location costs are cheaper and the broader energy industry is trying to cut costs following last year's oil price collapse and a broader wave of consolidation.
Statoil's decision is part of a broader trend in the energy industry.
Last May, Houston-based Murphy Oil Corp. announced it was closing its Calgary office and relocating staff in Alberta and in Arkansas to Texas. At the time, the company employed 110 people in Calgary.
Suncor Energy Inc. announced in 2020 that it would consolidate its 700-person teams in Mississauga and Oakville, Ont. and relocate them to Calgary in 2021. However, the company is also embarking on a broader cost-cutting effort that is expected to eliminate up to 2,000 jobs across the country."

| Jump to first hitThis includes funding for Longship, and the Ministry is given power of attorney to enter into agreements with Northern Lights, as proposed. The Storting also provided a few amendments, emphasising the need for cost control, risk management, and benefit realisation.The Government has laid out its plans for Longship in a white paper, which will be debated by the Storting early in 2021. The formal approval of the plan for development/installation and operation (PDO/PIO) will take place as soon as the Storting has adopted the white paper.Today, Minister of Petroleum and Energy Tina Bru held a press conference on the Northern Lights project with CEOs of Equinor, Shell and Total.Equinor's press release: Go-ahead for the Northern Lights project.- Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is important to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Longship is the largest climate project in the Norwegian industry and will contribute substantially to the development of CCS as an efficient mitigation measure. Working together with the industry, the step-by-step approach has confirmed that the project is feasible. I want to thank the Northern Lights partners Equinor, Shell and Total and I am looking forward to our continued cooperation, says Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Mrs. Tina Bru.Longship is a major step in the Norwegian commitment to our common ambitions to combat climate change. It is also an important achievement for Norwegian industry.A large number of CCS projects are necessary to reach our climate targets at the lowest possible cost. We have a solid foundation in Norway for contributing to further development of CCS technology and solutions. Our long experience with safe storage of CO2 at the Snøhvit and Sleipner fields are prominent examples. They are good illustrations of utilising technology from the petroleum industry to fight climate change.The comprehensive decision basis we have presented to the Storting is a result of close collaboration with the industry. Gassnova has also been an important contributor. The industry will own and operate the projects. The state will provide sufficient support to get the job done.- Together with the industry partners we have negotiated support agreements that provide the right mechanisms for a successful project. The agreements stimulate cost discipline, efficient utilisation, and further development of the infrastructure. I am encouraged by the fact that Northern Lights experiences huge interest in storing CO2, Minister Bru says.BackgroundThe national budget for 2021 was adopted 14 December 2020. The Storting approved to allocate funding for 2021 to the implementation of Longship and to award state aid in accordance with the negotiated agreements concerning the carbon capture projects of Norcem and subsequently Fortum Oslo Varme (FOV), on the condition that FOV obtains sufficient own funding and funding from the EU or other sources. State aid awarded to FOV is limited to a maximum of NOK 2 billion in investments and NOK 1 billion in operating expenses. FOV must clarify whether it wishes to implement the project on these conditions within three months of the funding decision from the second round of calls issued by the EU's Innovation Fund, but no later than 31 December 2024.The overall investments for the project are estimated to be NOK 17.1 billion. The pertaining operating costs for ten years of operation are estimated to be NOK 8 billion. The total cost estimate is thereby NOK 25.1 billion. Longship receives state aid in accordance with negotiated agreements. The state's share of the costs is estimated to be NOK 16.8 billion. This means that the state covers around two thirds of the costs of the project.Longship paves the way for clean hydrogenLongship facilitates the production of blue hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and storage. This results in hydrogen with very low emissions and a major potential for value creation in Norway and for greenhouse gas emission cuts in Europe. Hydrogen also plays a key role in the EU's Green Deal.The national budget includes a brief description of the Longship project. The complete basis for the state's decision to invest in Longship is presented in the white paper on Longship: Meld. St. 33 (2019-2020) Langskip - fangst og lagring av CO2. An English translation of the white paper is now available here: link.The white paper on Longship was originally scheduled to be heard by the Storting on December 10.

Eni, the Italian energy group, has bought a 20 per cent stake for £405m in the UK's Dogger Bank, which will be the world's largest offshore wind farm, from Norway's Equinor and utility group SSE.
The acquisition marks the entry of Eni into the northern European offshore wind market and helps take the energy company closer towards its target to install 5GW of renewable energy capacity by 2025.
""Entering the offshore wind market in northern Europe is a great opportunity to gain further skills in the sector, thanks to the collaboration with two of the industry's leading companies,"" said Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of Eni.
Dogger Bank is a 3.6GW wind farm under construction that can power 6m UK homes, fulfilling 5 per cent of the UK's energy needs. The project, off the east coast of England in the North Sea, is expected to be completed for a total cost of £6bn in three phases. The first is due to come online in 2023.
Eni will gain a stake in the first two phases, Dogger Bank A and B, while the final stage remains split evenly between SSE and Equinor.
Eni adopted in February a longerterm goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, triggering a concerted push towards investing more in renewable energy along with peers such as BP, Equinor and Royal Dutch Shell.
That contrasts with other energy majors such as ExxonMobil that have stuck behind oil throughout the coronavirus-induced drop in crude prices. For Equinor and SSE, each of which will continue to hold a 40 per cent stake in the project, the sale brings in returns that can be further invested into other low-carbon energy initiatives, or potentially be returned to shareholders. SSE yesterday raised its expected adjusted earnings guidance per share by 10p to a range of 85p to 90p a share, although the previous estimate included the assumption that Dogger Bank would be sold. The gain on the sale added 19p to those earnings after deducting transaction costs, it added.
Shares in SSE rose 1.6 per cent in early London trading yesterday.

Italian energy giant Eni has agreed to buy a 20% stake in the world's largest offshore wind farm project from the U.K.'s SSE and Norway's Equinor, sending the stock close to 3% higher on Friday.
FTSE 100-listed energy company SSE said it has sold a 10% stake in
the first two phases
of the Dogger Bank Wind Farm project—off the northeastern coast of England—to Eni for £202.5 million ($273 million), immediately raising its own profit guidance. Eni has also agreed to buy a 10% stake from the project's partner Equinor for a further £202.5 million, the Norwegian company said.
The project, expected to be completed in March 2026, will be the largest offshore wind farm in the world, generating enough electricity to supply 5% of the U.K.'s demand—equivalent to six million homes.
The world's largest oil-and-gas companies have endured a tough 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic decimated demand for much of the year. However, the industry's plight has served to
accelerate its shift toward green energy
, with BP, Shell and Total all ramping up strategies to be net zero on carbon by 2050. Equinor and SSE both announced the same 2050 target in November, while in February Eni set out long-term goals to slash emissions by 80% by 2050.

Following the deal, Eni will hold a 20% stake in Dogger Bank A and B, while Equinor and SSE will hold a 40% interest each. The third phase of the North Sea project, Dogger Bank C, will remain 50-50 owned by SSE and Equinor.
The Scottish-based company's subsidiary SSE Renewables will lead the development and construction of the project, while Equinor will operate it on completion. SSE said proceeds from the sale would go toward its low carbon growth plans. The company raised its full-year earnings guidance on Friday, and said it now expected earnings per share (EPS) of 85p to 90p, from a previous outlook of 75p to 85p at its half-year results in November. The stock rose 2.2% in early trading.
The guidance, it said, depended on normal weather conditions and assumed the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic would land in the middle of its £150 million to £250 million range.
Looking ahead. The renewable energy revolution is gathering speed, with a number of the world's biggest players targeting wind power. BP
entered the offshore wind market
in September in a $1.1 billion deal with Equinor for 50% stakes in two U.S. projects. Italian giant Eni has now entered the U.K. offshore wind market, having set up a joint venture with Norwegian private-equity firm HitecVision in November to take part in coming tenders in Norway. Shares in the Italian company were 2.6% higher on Friday.
Equinor has once again captured value from one of its wind projects, and looks well positioned to be a major force in the green energy drive, although the stock fell 4.5% on Friday.
SSE's strategy is also an interesting one, as it looks to sell down stakes in its projects to around 30% to 40%, realizing value early on, reducing risk, and controlling net debt. SSE Renewables is also leading the construction of two other U.K. wind farms. However, Citi analysts noted that despite the profit forecast hike, a 19p EPS increase was due to the Eni sale. Without that, underlying EPS comes in lower than the consensus, they said, rating the stock a 'sell.'

| Jump to first hitAgainst the backdrop of the climate crisis and amidst global calls for a cleaner oil and gas sector, governments, investors and civil society are challenging the role of oil and gas companies in transforming the global energy system, writes Abdulaziz Khattak for OGNIn A rapidly changing world, technology helps solve old and new challenges with renewed vision, expanding horizons. But innovation alone means nothing without committed action.Across the oil and gas sector, an emerging class of industrial pioneers is rising to the challenge. Introducing technologies that fast-track safer, more efficient and more sustainable production.'We believe it’s time to celebrate these innovation leaders. To grow awareness, drive collaboration and inspire the whole sector to embrace a clean energy future,' says a spokesman for Axora, a new cross-industry innovation hub for digital solutions.Against the backdrop of the climate crisis, governments, investors and civil society are challenging the role of oil and gas companies in transforming the global energy system.The question is complex and multi-layered. Beyond fossil fuel products themselves, a significant proportion of global GHG emissions are caused by the production process itself, and atmospheric methane leaks in particular.According to International Energy Agency’s (IEA) World Energy Outlook report, 15 per cent of global energy GHG emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground. In the face of this and other urgent challenges such as price volatility amid the Covid-19 pandemic, leading industrials are looking to technology to change the way oil and gas is discovered, drilled and produced. These strategic initiatives are being supported by an increasingly generous public sector.From robotic drills to renewable energy grids, drone exploration to data collection and analytics, today’s flourishing tech ecosystem is driving a cleaner, more sustainable operating model for upstream energy.Axora in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group researched companies in the oil and gas sector around the world. It benchmarking their commitment to innovation and R&D investment, with a special focus on sustainability outcomes.AUTONOMOUS MACHINERYA new generation of unmanned vehicles is helping to propel sustainability and environmental standards forward, from exploration to asset inspections and even full platform automation. These autonomous robots can operate in harsher and less accessible areas than humans, which means better safety and reduced environmental risk.Unmanned systems such as aerial drones and underwater vehicles provide state-of-the-art surveys of remote land and sea environments. In addition, the latest robotic drilling solutions enable full platform automation, reducing the need for human presence on offshore rigs.Autonomous machinery improve sustainability by reducing ecological footprint of exploration, reducing impact on land and marine wildlife, and through unmanned operations improve worker safety.The innovation leader in this segment is energy giant Total, which is pioneering an automated drone system to survey the harshest desert terrain in Abu Dhabi, the UAE, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc).A remotely operated fleet of drones drop dart-shaped sensors over the exploration area to deliver high resolution 3D and 4D sub surface images in real time. The sensors are later retrieved by unmanned vehicles.Billed as the world’s first automated seismic acquisition system, these drones can make exploration safer, more efficient and less ecologically intrusive. Above 10 sq km can be surveyed daily by the drone fleet'Using drones helps us reduce the environmental footprint of our onshore exploration campaigns,' says Dominique Janodet, Vice President R&D, Total Exploration and Production.ELECTRIFICATIONElectricity is a far cleaner, more reliable alternative to the high maintenance gas turbines traditionally used to power upstream oil and gas operations.The infrastructure for carrying electric power from land to offshore platforms has already been pioneered by industry – and could help to move clean energy between countries and continents.Subsea cables are an increasingly reliable way to deliver electricity to remote platforms, removing the need for costly diesel backup systems. The electricity can be generated by national grids or sustainable sources such as wind turbines, geothermal or hydroelectric.Electrification improves sustainability by removing the need for carbon-intensive gas turbines, improved power reliability and removes need for diesel backup, and future-proofs production for clean energy transition.Norwegian company Equinor is electrifying its giant Johan Sverdrup offshore field in the North Sea via subsea cables from the Norwegian mainland.With over 200 km of cable already laid on the sea bed, including fibre optics for remote communications and monitoring, this solution is making Johan Sverdrup one of the world's most carbon-efficient fields.Once completed, the solution will save around 460,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, the rough equivalent of 230,000 cars, with total production emissions set to be 20 times lower than average on the continental shelf.'By choosing land-based power, we see the potential for cutting more than 1.3 million tonnes of CO2 per year,' says Arne Sigve Nylund, Executive Vice President, Equinor.RENEWABLE & LOW CARBON ENERGYAs the global transition to net zero emissions gathers pace, renewable and low carbon energy solutions like wind, solar power and hydrogen from natural gas are increasingly viable for powering energy production at scale.The focus of much government investment, these solutions have the potential to yield lasting sustainability dividends as a core component of the world’s energy infrastructure.Floating solar and wind farms can power remote and offshore operations and reduce the need for gas turbines.Natural gas can be reformed into clean burning hydrogen gas and decarbonised at source using carbon capture and storage technology before blending hydrogen within the existing natural gas networks.Renewable and low carbon energy improve sustainability by virtually eliminating CO2 emissions from production, accelerating global energy transition, and driving public-private infrastructure partnerships.At St Fergus in Scotland, Pale Blue Dot Energy’s Acorn hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects are deploying new technologies to convert natural gas into clean burning hydrogen.With the help of substantial government funding, the company’s St Fergus facility will reform offshore natural gas into hydrogen, capturing and storing the CO2 created underground. The hydrogen will then be blended into existing pipelines that supply homes, offices and factories. About 35 per cent of UK’s natural gas supply could be decarbonised at St Fergus.'Blending as little as 2 per cent hydrogen into the gas grid at St Fergus would remove 400 kilo tons of CO2 a year from the energy system,' says Sam Gomersall, Commercial Director, Pale Blue Dot Energy.The Aberdeen Vision project also explored the potential for a purpose-built hydrogen pipeline. This would allow for the conversion of Aberdeen to a 20 per cent hydrogen blend which in time could grow to a 100 per cent hydrogen system.DIGITALISATIONThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is driving safer, more sustainable and energy efficient operations in upstream oil and gas.With the latest data collection and advanced analytics tools, remote monitoring stations can become aware of any potential issues before they happen, reducing the risk of asset failure and damaging leaks.Sophisticated sensing hardware is installed onsite, with inbuilt connectivity and full systems integration. This means data can be collected and processed in real time with pinpoint accuracy, using the latest artificial intelligence and algorithm-driven analytics.Digitalisation improves sustainability by protecting the environment by preventing leaks, reducing the risk of greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane, and improving energy efficiency as well as safety.GE Energy operates three iCenters in Florence (Italy), Houston (US) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) to achieve 24/7 remote monitoring of more than 800 upstream assets around the globe.With the ability to collect and analyse vast datasets, the team of diagnostic engineers can spot any deviations from normal performance early, helping to mitigate the risk of costly downtime.This helps to protect asset integrity, maximise productivity gains and minimise leaks and other risks to the environment as well as improving worker safety.'By looking at today’s data, we are able to see tomorrow’s potential issues,' says Gionata Ruggiero, Service Engineering Manager, GE Energy.CONCLUSIONSuccessful transformation strategies can look very different from one organisation to another. And varying resources and requirements make it hard to know where to start.Whether an organisation is already a digital leader or is still in the discovery phase, there are some strategies to help it move sustainability forwards within its operations.• Analyse current assets and model projected financial, production and emissions scenarios.• Establish the long term business opportunities and risks from climate change and sustainability issues.• Develop a detailed business case and define decision makers to choose strategic priorities.• Once strategic priorities are defined, build a detailed roadmap for implementation.© Copyright 2019 www.tradearabia.comCopyright 2020 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

European oil stocks have been battered this year, with the pandemic-induced price crash adding to companies' challenges of reversing historical underperformance while navigating the tricky transition to cleaner fuels.
Faced with this ""triple whammy"", as Shell's Ben van Beurden has called it, the crisis-hit sector's battle to win back investors has become much tougher.
""What is it going to take for investors to take that leap of faith?"" said Luke Parker at consultancy WoodMackenzie. ""These companies are all on a journey and they need to strike the right balance between their traditional businesses and new ones. Can they bring investors along with them?"" While the region's oil majors have set out their goals to achieve net zero emissions and shift towards cleaner forms of energy, their ambitions are yet to be matched with investment. As their share prices have dropped this year — notwithstanding a bounce after vaccine developments — specialist renewable energy stocks have surged.
Colin Baines, investment engagement manager at Friends Provident Foundation, said that ""to be taken seriously and receive a climate premium"", the European majors ""need to adopt meaningful low-carbon transition plans. Whilst they have done more than their US counterparts, none are transitioning away from oil in any meaningful sense ... capital expenditure is still overwhelmingly in oil and gas.""
Behind this is the realisation that even if oil executives manage to transform their businesses, they cannot guarantee significant earnings and returns in the next decade.
Despite new climate pledges, companies from Shell and BP to Italy's Eni and France's Total used the most recent earnings season to emphasise shareholder handouts and improvements in hydrocarbon businesses as they reiterated their focus on lowering costs and more disciplined capital spending.
BP chief executive Bernard Looney, who in August said the company would cut oil production by 40 per cent by 2030 and increase low-carbon investment 10-fold by 2030, tried to convince investors the group was focused above all else on ""value creation"". He said: ""This is not about altruism or charity.""
Eni and Total said they would defend investor returns, while Shell — after slashing its payout in April for the first time since the war — announced a ""new era"" of dividend growth.
Mirza Baig, global head of governance and stewardship at Aviva Investors, said this year's share price falls were ""a reflection of the depressed oil price and the shedding of income investors"".
Companies spoke during the most recent quarterly earnings season about divestments of non-core assets and focused oil and gas businesses that would throw off more cash, while emphasising other parts of the business such as petrol stations that have been overlooked for years.
Even as oil companies say their opera-tional prowess, reach and knowhow will support their ability to stake a claim over the future energy system, they have relatively little expertise in the renewables business.
Some investors and executives believe the sector should stick with what it knows best. One analyst warned that if companies ""get woke"", they would ""go broke"". Morgan Stanley analysts calculate that per unit of energy produced, renewables require up to five times as much capital expenditure as oil and gas projects.
With finances under pressure in the short and medium term, companies embarking on the long transition are deploying new strategies to persuade investors to hang on for the ride.
Anders Opedal, the new chief executive of Norway's Equinor, said the company would report results in its renewables division separately from the first quarter of 2021. ""This is to increase transparency around how we are building renewables over time and how society and investors can follow how we develop our renewables strategy.""
Spain's Repsol recently suggested that a wind and solar joint venture in Chile could serve as a blueprint for its future renewables business. Chief executive Josu Jon Imaz pointed to ""a potential IPO"". At the same time, industry executives point to inconsistencies in the positions of some investors.
Equinor, whose share price fall this year of about 17 per cent is a lot less than some peers at more than 40 per cent, is being lauded for being ahead of the game on renewables. But the company, like US majors ExxonMobil and Chevron, still plans to increase production in the coming years even as others plan to hold steady or decrease theirs.
Investment houses are split internally. While some parts of the business are keen to keep investing in oil companies, others will not. Amanda O'Toole, portfolio manager of the AXA WF Framlington Clean Economy fund, does not hold these stocks because the vast majority of their capital is ""tied up in oil"". But majors were held elsewhere in the business because they had a role in the shift to a lower-carbon world. ""I don't think it is time to wash our hands of these players.""
Oil groups are held in some portfolios with environmental, social and governance considerations but shunned from others, making it hard to gauge how far groups need to go to placate shareholders. ""Everyone has a different view,"" said Iain Pyle, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""If a company makes most of its money from generating oil, that's not usually going to fit. But companies that are making positive changes in their business model ... That deserves some merit.""
Some shareholders champion the divestment movement but also believe they have a responsibility to stay invested in the biggest corporate polluters to help clean them up. They acknowledge that traditional oil and gas groups will be vital for the energy system for a long time to come.
Diandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at UK pension fund Nest, said big energy companies had an ""important role"" to play in the energy transition. But investing in oil stocks could become even less attractive for asset managers under the EU's green finance rules that from next year will impose tougher disclosure requirements on investors in oil companies. Some environmental activists and investors, meanwhile, do not believe an oil company can ever be a truly ethical investment, particularly when a string of other options exist, from Danish offshore wind producer Orsted to Spanish utility Iberdrola.

He said: ""This is not about altruism or charity.""
Eni and Total said they would defend investor returns, while Shell — after slashing its payout in April for the first time since the war — announced a ""new era"" of dividend growth.
Mirza Baig, global head of governance and stewardship at Aviva Investors, said this year's share price falls were ""a reflection of the depressed oil price and the shedding of income investors"".
Companies spoke during the most recent quarterly earnings season about divestments of non-core assets and focused oil and gas businesses that would throw off more cash, while emphasising other parts of the business such as petrol stations that have been overlooked for years.
Even as oil companies say their opera-tional prowess, reach and knowhow will support their ability to stake a claim over the future energy system, they have relatively little expertise in the renewables business.
Some investors and executives believe the sector should stick with what it knows best. One analyst warned that if companies ""get woke"", they would ""go broke"". Morgan Stanley analysts calculate that per unit of energy produced, renewables require up to five times as much capital expenditure as oil and gas projects.
With finances under pressure in the short and medium term, companies embarking on the long transition are deploying new strategies to persuade investors to hang on for the ride.
Anders Opedal, the new chief executive of Norway's Equinor, said the company would report results in its renewables division separately from the first quarter of 2021. ""This is to increase transparency around how we are building renewables over time and how society and investors can follow how we develop our renewables strategy.""
Spain's Repsol recently suggested that a wind and solar joint venture in Chile could serve as a blueprint for its future renewables business. Chief executive Josu Jon Imaz pointed to ""a potential IPO"". At the same time, industry executives point to inconsistencies in the positions of some investors.
Equinor, whose share price fall this year of about 17 per cent is a lot less than some peers at more than 40 per cent, is being lauded for being ahead of the game on renewables. But the company, like US majors ExxonMobil and Chevron, still plans to increase production in the coming years even as others plan to hold steady or decrease theirs.
Investment houses are split internally. While some parts of the business are keen to keep investing in oil companies, others will not. Amanda O'Toole, portfolio manager of the AXA WF Framlington Clean Economy fund, does not hold these stocks because the vast majority of their capital is ""tied up in oil"". But majors were held elsewhere in the business because they had a role in the shift to a lower-carbon world. ""I don't think it is time to wash our hands of these players.""
Oil groups are held in some portfolios with environmental, social and governance considerations but shunned from others, making it hard to gauge how far groups need to go to placate shareholders. ""Everyone has a different view,"" said Iain Pyle, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""If a company makes most of its money from generating oil, that's not usually going to fit. But companies that are making positive changes in their business model ... That deserves some merit.""
Some shareholders champion the divestment movement but also believe they have a responsibility to stay invested in the biggest corporate polluters to help clean them up. They acknowledge that traditional oil and gas groups will be vital for the energy system for a long time to come.
Diandra Soobiah, head of responsible investment at UK pension fund Nest, said big energy companies had an ""important role"" to play in the energy transition. But investing in oil stocks could become even less attractive for asset managers under the EU's green finance rules that from next year will impose tougher disclosure requirements on investors in oil companies. Some environmental activists and investors, meanwhile, do not believe an oil company can ever be a truly ethical investment, particularly when a string of other options exist, from Danish offshore wind producer Orsted to Spanish utility Iberdrola. ""Why should I wait around until they can prove they are able to make money from all the cleaner energy stuff?"" one asset manager said. ""There are plenty of other ways I can generate returns for my clients.""Some analysts say that the industry should stick with what it knows. Get woke and go broke, warns one

Panasonic is expanding its battery business into Europe, moving beyond supplying Tesla in the U.S., as it seeks to establish a foothold in a region where electric-vehicle sales are set to grow rapidly.
Shares in the Japanese electronics giant fell near 3% in Tokyo trading, where the Nikkei 225 index dipped more than 1% on Wednesday.
The back story. Panasonic supplies batteries to Tesla in the U.S., where the two companies have a joint venture in the form of a $5 billion gigafactory in Nevada. Tesla, which joined with Panasonic to take advantage of the Japanese company's advanced battery technology and intellectual property, announced in September that it had plans to produce its own batteries as part of its strategy of vertical integration.
Europe is one of the fastest-moving spaces in the race to dominate an expected boom in electric vehicles, with at least 12 countries planning a ban on internal combustion engine vehicles in coming years. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Wednesday a ban on the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars, to come into effect by 2030.
Tesla is building a gigafactory in Germany and is reportedly planning one in the U.K., while one of its key rivals, Northvolt, is building a gigafactory in Sweden. Established European car makers like Daimler, Volkswagen, and BMW are racing to build electric vehicles on their own or through partnerships, and Panasonic has previously supplied batteries to Volkswagen and Peugeot.
Plus:
Panasonic Will Invest More on Making Tesla's Batteries

What's new. On Wednesday, Panasonic, Norwegian state-owned oil company Equinor, and Norwegian aluminum group Hydro announced that they had formed a strategic partnership to explore setting up a green battery business in Norway.
The companies said they would assess the market for lithium-ion batteries in Europe and complete the case for a Norwegian green battery business, aiming to finish this exploratory phase by mid 2021. Alongside engaging with potential customers in the automotive industry, and other sectors, the group will also investigate an integrated supply chain for battery manufacturing.
""This collaboration combines Panasonic's position as an innovative technology company and leader in lithium-ion batteries, with the deep industrial experience of Equinor and Hydro,"" said Mototsugu Sato, Panasonic's executive vice president.

Looking ahead. Panasonic's venture into Europe reaffirms the region as the key battleground for electric vehicle manufacturing and battery production. JPMorgan estimates that, by 2025, electric vehicles and hybrid-electric vehicles will comprise 30% of all auto sales, and Europe leads the way in setting out strong regulation against internal combustion engine vehicles.
Norway is a strong choice for a move into Europe, and Equinor a good partner, because the country has the world's highest penetration per capita of electric vehicles, and a firm commitment to supporting green energy projects.

On a secluded RAF base five miles north of Hadrian's wall in Cumbria, three ordinary-looking brick terrace houses are at the centre of an experiment that could radically slash emissions from one of the dirtiest parts of the economy.
The specially built uninhabited properties have been fitted with boilers running entirely on hydrogen rather than the natural gas that heats most UK homes, which are responsible for nearly a fifth of the country's carbon emissions.
Boris Johnson will this week lay out his plans for a ""green industrial revolution"". The prime minister has pledged to make a ""big bet"" on technologies such as hydrogen, which is emerging as an area of global interest as countries adopt targets to halt carbon emissions.
The Cumbrian trial, led by energy consultancy DNV GL, is one of many hydrogen projects under development in the UK as it joins other countries, such as Japan and Germany, in researching whether the gas could remove emissions from some of the most polluting sectors of the economy, including heating, heavy industry and long-distance transport.
""Hydrogen has been with us as an industrial gas that is widely used for 100 years or more. What has changed ... is a growing realisation that it could play a really important part in decarbonisation,"" said Jon Maddy, director of the hydrogen centre at the University of South Wales and a member of the government's hydrogen advisory council. This has not gone unnoticed by researchers in Cumbria. ""Very quickly we discovered an amazing level of interest [in the trial],"" said Hari Vamadevan, head of DNV GL's oil and gas operations in the UK.
Although hydrogen has long been used in industrial processes, such as the manufacture of petroleum products, currently it is largely derived from fossil fuels and is responsible for 830m tonnes of carbon emissions a year globally — equivalent to emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined, according to the International Energy Agency.
Governments and companies now want to produce the fuel without releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere — either through the electrolysis of water (known as ""green"" hydrogen) or by capturing and safely securing carbon emissions when it is produced from natural gas (""blue"" hydrogen).
Supporters of this so-called clean hydrogen argue it could provide a neat answer to slashing emissions from areas such as heating and long-distance transport because it may not require behavioural change.
""We've done a lot of research ... that says one of the biggest things customers don't want is disruption,"" said Tim Harwood, who is in charge of hydrogen projects at Northern Gas Networks, which owns local gas grids in north-east England. For instance, the government could mandate hydrogen-ready boilers, he said. ""[Existing boilers] are easily convertible to hydrogen when the time comes by just simply changing a few small parts and probably half an hour's disruption.""
Industries such as chemicals and steel that require high heat have few options other than hydrogen to replace fossil fuels, say experts.
""For the chemical industry it will replace natural gas for making ethanol and ammonia,"" said Grete Tveit, who leads low carbon solutions at Equinor, the Norwegian energy group that plans to supply ""blue"" hydrogen to a large chemicals park in Hull as part of a wider project to decarbonise industry in the Humber area.
Supporters of the fuel — including companies such as Anglo American, Equinor, Orsted and Siemens — want the government to produce a hydrogen strategy setting out how large projects could be funded and industries incentivised to switch from fossil fuels.
""We need to see at least some indication of a business model before we start spending the large money,"" said Ms Tveit. Other countries and regions have already set targets that are giving industry the confidence to invest. For example, the EU in July said it wanted to install at least 40 gigawatts of green hydrogen capacity by 2030.
UK ministers have promised to respond ""early"" next year, while a longawaited energy white paper, expected before Christmas, will also include plans for hydrogen. ""Hydrogen has the potential to be a vital part of the UK's future net zero energy mix,"" said the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
But sceptics argue the properties of hydrogen have risks. It carries a fraction of the calorific value of natural gas and has a smaller molecule, so there is a greater chance of leaks.
Richard Lowes of Exeter university argues that fossil fuel companies have been ""overselling"" hydrogen — particularly for heating — because it would allow them to continue using their natural gas infrastructure. He believes hydrogen is likely to have ""niche"" uses and would potentially be most useful for decarbonising heavy industry or for storing renewable-produced electricity for longer periods than batteries.
""I think we are totally carried away,"" said Dr Lowes. ""The trouble is we just don't know at the moment because it's never been done and there all of these uncertainties.""
Rather than count on hydrogen for heating, British Gas backs the rollout of electric heat pumps in homes, saying it is ""not clear when hydrogen will be ready for domestic use"".
Back in Cumbria, those involved in the hydrogen-testing project say concerns, such as those of Dr Lowes and others, will be answered only through trials. ""There is no way any of us in the gas industry would move forward if [hydrogen] was going to be more risky,"" said Antony Green, hydrogen project director at National Grid.'[Existing boilers] are easily convertible to hydrogen by changing a few small parts and probably half an hour's disruption'

Major oil companies are in the early stages of one of the biggest transformations in any industry in decades. Nearly all of them are starting to make investments in low-carbon businesses, investing in wind, solar, and
hydrogen power
.
Investors clearly have mixed opinions about this shift. Big pension funds and other institutional investors are demanding that oil companies make this change, but as the companies invest in renewables, their stock prices tend to fall.
BP (BP) is one example. The company announced plans this year to produce net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and
increased its spending on renewable projects
-- goals that are in line with investor demands. But its stock has continued to fall. It's now down 48% this year, worse than its Big Oil competitors.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria published a note on Tuesday analyzing this shift, and considering which companies might be able to best navigate it.
The key problem is this: Renewable energy companies are often valued on their expected future earnings. Solar development firms, for instance, often report annual losses but receive lofty valuations from investors because of expectations that their current investments will pay off in the future.
Oil companies, however, are valued on their ability to pay their dividends in the near term. Their cash flows this year and next are of paramount importance to investors. Growth isn't really part of the calculus. Oil companies aren't expected to grow much in the years ahead, because even the most bullish analysts doubt that oil demand will rise more than a total of 10% in the next decade from 2019 levels.
Renewables are capital-intensive businesses -- similar to oil and gas -- meaning that they demand high upfront investments. So oil-and-gas companies that spend on renewables today will cut into their ability to pay out strong dividends or buy back stock. And they won't get the financial benefits of those investments for years to come.
As a result, oil-and-gas companies are stuck in a bind -- their near-term investments won't help them with investors because they'll reduce cash flow. And Wall Street won't value their renewables segments like they value stand-alone renewables companies, because oil-and-gas companies still have their legacy businesses dragging down their valuations.
One option to get around this issue might be to spin off the renewables businesses once they achieve scale, Borkhataria suggests.
""If the valuation disconnects continue, clearly the majors may look to spin out low-carbon segments in order to crystallize some of the 'value' created,"" he wrote. ""We think this is a possibility in the coming years.""
Oil-and-gas companies with large renewables portfolios could use spinoffs to realize that value. ""After risking assets, we estimate that Equinor, Galp [Energia], and Total have the most material low-carbon businesses, and these could represent 17%, 15% and 10% of current enterprise values, respectively, if valued in isolation,"" he wrote. ""We think this represents significant optionality in the current share prices.""
Borkhataria also upgraded BP and Chevron (CVX) to Sector Perform from Underperform because both now have more-reasonable valuations and good prospects for shareholder returns.
His top picks in the industry are Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A), Total (TOT), and Equinor (EQNR).
""Our preference is for those with the best free cash flow generation potential, healthier balance sheets, but also those that have started to build a track record in low carbon,"" he wrote.

| Jump to first hitJoseph Chang France-based Total and the UK’s BP are among those leading the charge in a massive transition towards renewable energy, building brand-new businesses in power generation, energy storage and charging stations.Both have committed to become “carbon net zero” by 2050. For traditional oil giants, this is a radical pivot.Total sees global solar and wind power capacity growing 10%/year through 2030, with solar capturing around 70% of the additions, as it outlined at its Investor Day on September 30.The company has 7 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind power generation capacity, and aims to quintuple this to 35GW by 2025 with major solar projects in Europe, the Middle East and India, and offshore wind farm projects in the UK and South Korea.The renewable energy push is not just a European phenomenon, but increasingly global.By 2025, Total expects its global renewable power footprint to be 15GW in Europe, 6GW in India, 3GW each in the US, China and South America, 2GW each in the Middle East and Rest of Asia, and 1GW in Africa.The company also is playing in the solar distributed generation (DG) space worldwide through joint ventures and equity stakes in solar panel production-and-installation companies.BP noted that global average costs for solar and offshore wind builds have declined by 90% and 60%, respectively, over the past decade. It expects costs to fall a further 30-40% over the next decade, it said at its BP Week event in mid-September.Renewables - solar, wind and bio-power - have the potential to become 45% of global power capacity by 2030, it noted.“We are leaning in and plan to build material renewables businesses, with an ambition to have developed 50GW [of capacity] by 2030,” said Dev Sanyal, BP executive vice president for Gas and Low Carbon Energy.This is from a base of just 2.5GW in 2019. BP aims to boost its “low-carbon investment” by 10x to $5 billion annually to reach its 50GW goal by 2030.BP solar projects in the pipeline include Bighorn Solar in Colorado which will supply 300 megawatts (MW) to the steel company EVRAZ, and the 260MW Impact solar project in Texas, where BP is off-taking 100% of the electricity. It is also developing solar projects in Spain, Brazil, Australia and India.On September 10, BP entered the offshore wind power market through a partnership in the US with Equinor. It is paying Equinor $1.1 billion for stakes in existing assets and will jointly develop four projects in offshore New York and Massachusetts to generate a combined 4.4GW - enough to power over 2 million homes.BP’s onshore wind energy portfolio in the US already generates 1.7GW of power.THE RATIONALEShould oil companies be investing in solar, wind, battery technology and networks of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations? Maybe, in the broader view of themselves as energy companies. And especially if the consumer shifts to EVs faster than expected, crushing demand for transportation fuels.It comes down to whether they’re focused on the product or the customer. If the customer is demanding different kinds of energy, it should make sense to provide it, as long as the economics are there.This would have broader implications for petrochemicals supply and demand. If more oil companies prioritise green energy projects, viewing them as the future growth drivers, there may be less emphasis on building petrochemicals and polymers capacity.And with less transportation fuel demand, refining capacity could be cut, thereby reducing naphtha feedstock supply as well as aromatics and propylene co-product.Already some traditional refineries are being converted to biorefineries in Europe as well as in the US. In these cases, it’s not just about swapping feedstock. Rather, overall fuels output is significantly reduced.SOLAR IN THE SPOTLIGHTThe International Energy Agency (IEA) sees solar as the future of electricity as governments and investors focus on clean energy.“I see solar becoming the new king of the world’s electricity markets. Based on today’s policy settings, it is on track to set new records for deployment every year after 2022,” said Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, in the group’s World Energy Outlook 2020 report released on October 13.“If governments and investors step up their clean energy efforts in line with our Sustainable Development Scenario, the growth of both solar and wind would be even more spectacular – and hugely encouraging for overcoming the world’s climate challenge,” he added.OIL DEMAND FOR PETROCHEMICALSBP and Total expect oil demand to decline over the long run. Total sees this not just for transportation fuel, but for chemicals and plastics as well.Under two of its scenarios, “Momentum” and “Rupture”, “the message is that despite an increase in demand for plastics, especially in non-OECD countries, the oil demand for petrochemicals is likely to come down,” said Helle Kristoffersen, president of Strategy & Innovation at Total.Total assumes a steady increase in plastics recycling on one hand, along with a progressive ban on single-use plastics - first in the EU and China, and then moving worldwide.In the Rupture scenario, the single-use plastics ban is implemented worldwide, where in Momentum it is only in Europe and China. This drives plastics recycling rates to rise from 7% today to 50% by 2050 under “Rupture” and 40% under “Momentum”.“All of this holds back the need for virgin plastics, and therefore, the need for oil,” said Kristoffersen.Total sees oil demand for petrochemicals peaking between the mid-2020s and 2030 under both scenarios. The company maintains a sizeable footprint in global petrochemicals.BP in June 2020 announced the planned sale of its global petrochemicals business to Ineos for $5 billion.“The future of our [chemicals] industry is no longer in oil and gas, but in recycled material. And companies that move into that area now will be the winners in the future,” said Paul Hodges, chairman of New Normal Consulting, on an ICIS podcast.“Sustainability is making this major change in the world and that is where we’re going to make our profit,” he added.BIOFUELS PUSHIn what Total calls the coming “mobility revolution”, it sees a “drastic reduction” in oil demand for transportation by 2050, potentially by well over 50%. Oil demand would be replaced by electricity, natural gas, biofuels and hydrogen.Total sees global biofuels demand doubling to almost 4 mbpd of oil equivalent by 2030, and potentially rising 4x by 2050 as governments seek to meet carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction targets. Biofuels reduce CO2 emissions by around 50% versus fossil fuels, it noted.The company plans to convert its Grandpuits refinery in France to produce 400,000 tonnes per year of biofuels starting in 2024, while also adding a plastics recycling facility, a PLA (polylactic acid) bioplastics plant and solar power at the site at a total cost of over €500 million ($588.74 million).The new biorefinery capacity of around 7,000 bpd will be a huge step down from the 100,000 bpd capacity of the existing refinery, although it was only operating at about 70% of capacity because of reduced pressure on a crude oil pipeline.The biorefinery will produce aviation fuel, biodiesel and 50,000 tpy of bio-naphtha for bioplastics production. The cost to convert to, or add biofuels capacity to existing facilities range from $500-750/tonne in capital spending (capex), according to Total. It identified projects that could cost up to $825 million at its Investor Day presentation.Ultimately, Total expects biofuels to account for 10-15% of its fuel sales by 2030. BP’s ambition in what it calls “bioenergy” is to more than double current production of around 22,000 bpd, to 50,000 bpd by 2025 and double it again by 2030 to over 100,000 bpd.The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated conversions to biorefineries as fuels demand plunged and recovery has been slow, making the economics challenging.“In developed nations, the longer-term demand shrinkage for crude-sourced road fuels in favour of greener alternatives - electrification, renewables, hydrogen – is encouraging refiners to consider alternate options to their existing business models,” said Michael Connolly, ICIS senior consultant, global refining.“Renewables are a very easy fit given they can still utilise much of the existing infrastructure as opposed to electrification and hydrogen, which require significant new infrastructure investment in both production and distribution,” he added.For some petrochemical producers, the dynamics will change. “The closures of some refining capacity - in Europe and non-US Gulf Coast - is offset by new capacity built in Asia and the Middle East, meaning sourcing may become more expensive if imported feedstock is required,” said Connolly.This would impact standalone petrochemicals producers, but integrated refining/petrochemical operations are unlikely to be impacted because of their competitiveness, the consultant noted.“Greater processing of renewables by refineries will also see opportunities for petrochemicals producers to buy renewable naphtha and LPG feedstocks, enabling them to meet some of their sustainability targets,” said Connolly.BATTERY GIGAFACTORIESTo engage in the “electric mobility revolution”, Total will ramp up investments in battery technology and EV charging stations.It sees EV market share growing to 60% or more of the global vehicle fleet by 2050, and grabbing the lion’s share in western Europe.Total is building out lithium-ion (Li-on) battery capacity in China through its Saft 40/60 joint venture with Tianneng. It also plans to build two EV battery “gigafactories”in France and Germany in a 50/50 JV with automaker PSA/Opel.The two gigafactories are projected to cost around €5 billion over 10 years, providing 48GWh (gigawatt hours) to power 1m EVs, or about 10% of the estimated European market by 2030.CHARGING AHEAD ON STATIONSTotal also operates over 12,000 B2G (battery-to-grid) charge points in Europe today, and aims to boost this to 50,000 by 2025.At vehicle service stations, the company will invest around €200 million to install 1,500 “fast and super-fast” chargers at 500 sites by 2025. For B2B fleets, it is targeting over 100,000 charge points.For electric mobility overall, Total is investing around €300 million from 2020-2025 in a bid to capture around 10% of the European market in B2G/B2B.BP is also charging ahead in electric mobility, with a plan to rapidly expand its network.“Crucially, EVs are no longer the exception - and by 2040 scale-up to around 900 million, almost 50% of the car parc (vehicles on the road). More than half of these EVs in 2040 are in the US, EU, UK and China,” said Emma Delaney, executive vice president, customer and products at BP.By 2030, BP aims to have over 70,000 charging points globally for EVs. “We plan to roll out a mix of rapid and ultra-fast chargers, in advantaged locations and mobility hubs for fleets starting with our four focus regions - the UK, US, Germany and China, which make up for over 60% of the EV car parc by 2030,” said Delaney.“In Germany, we have plans to roll-out 350KW ultra-fast chargers, which will allow customers 220 miles driving range with just 10 minutes of charging,” she noted.BP in 2018 acquired Chargemaster, the largest EV charging company in the UK. In 2019, BP and Didi Chuxing formed a joint venture to build out EV charging infrastructure in China.In September 2020, BP and Uber announced a partnership under which BP will build out a rapid charging network in London to enable Uber’s fleet in the city to go 100% electric by 2025.Hydrogen also features into Total and BP’s strategies, with the companies planning to build out generation capabilities and fuelling stations.Other European oil companies undertaking major renewable energy projects include Italy’s Eni, UK-based Shell and Spain’s Repsol.US OIL FAR FROM GREENIn contrast, big US oil companies have not shown much enthusiasm for a green strategic shift, and nowhere near the magnitude of their European counterparts.The EU’s European Green Deal, which aims to achieve zero net emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2050, is certainly giving European oil companies a big push. The EU will seek to enshrine the 2050 target into law, setting the direction for policy initiatives.No such policy directive exists in the US, but demand for EVs is on the rise, and solar and wind power continue to gain market share in the power generation mix. It will be interesting to see whether other oil companies enter these markets or cede them to utilities, battery producers and start-ups.Chevron in May 2019 announced a collaboration with EV charging network operator EVgo to install chargers at select Chevron stations in California. And ExxonMobil is collaborating with academic institutions and other external groups to expand technology development in renewable power, biofuels, carbon capture, grid-scale electric storage, long-distance battery storage and hydrogen.ExxonMobil is targeting the technical capability to produce 10,000 bpd of biofuels, including from algae, by 2025.US oil companies are dipping their toes into renewables but may need to pivot more quickly to meet future customer demands.Joseph Chang is the Global Editor of ICIS Chemical Business.

The project will lead to emission cuts, facilitate development of new technology and thus new jobs. And most importantly, we hope and think it will pave the way for more CCS in Europe and elsewhere.It is a therefore a great pleasure to be here with one on the most influential global companies.Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitReplace fossil carbon callHـRTH: The Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI), formed by 11 leading companies from six countries, aims to support and speed up the transition from fossil carbon to renewable carbon for all organic chemicals and materials. More than 100 well-known experts support the initiative personally. Companies, start-ups and institutes have joined the initiative as a member.RCI addresses the core problem of climate change, which is largely related to extracting and using additional fossil carbon from the ground. The vision is stated clearly: By 2050, fossil carbon shall be completely substituted by renewable carbon, which is carbon from alternative sources: biomass, direct CO2 utilisation and recycling. The founders are convinced that this is the only way for chemicals, plastics and other organic materials to become more sustainable, more climate-friendly and part of the circular economy – part of the future.Siemens Energy to exit coal powerBERLIN: Siemens Chief Executive has said he wanted the future managing board of Siemens Energy to quickly set out plans to exit coal-generated electricity.'The fight against climate change requires a decisive change in power generation, as it is responsible for about 40 percent of global energy-related CO2 emissions,' Joe Kaeser told an online general meeting on spinning out the power business.'That is why I have asked the Managing Board of Siemens Energy AG to quickly present a stakeholder-friendly plan to phase out coal-based power generation.'Nigeria to sell NNPC, overhaul reformsLAGOS: Nigeria's long-awaited oil reform bill would privatise the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), amend changes to deepwater royalties made late last year and scrap key regulatory agencies in favour of new bodies. The bill proposes turning the NNPC into a limited liability corporation into which the ministers of finance and petroleum would transfer NNPC assets. The legislation would also amend controversial changes to deep offshore royalties made late last year by cutting the royalty for offshore fields producing less than 15,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 7.5 per cent from 10 per cent. Equinor plans oilfield developmentOSLO: Equinor and its partners in Norway's Breidablikk oil discovery have agreed on an 18.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($1.95 billion) development plan for the North Sea field. Partners in the field are ConocoPhillips, Petoro and Vaar Energi, a unit of Eni.'The Breidablikk field is one of the largest undeveloped oil discoveries on the Norwegian continental shelf,' Equinor said in a statement.The field is estimated to contain some 200 million barrels of oil, and is scheduled to begin output in the first half of 2024, Equinor said.Deploying remote-control technology designed to cut costs, the field will have subsea-installations only, rather than a traditional platform, taking advantage of its proximity to the older Grane oil platform and an extensive pipeline network.India to privatise BPCLNEW DELHI: The privatisation of Bharat Petroleum Corp will unlock value by increasing investment and technology, its chairman told a shareholders meeting.The government is targeting that sale of its 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL in this fiscal year ending March 2021. But the privatisation could spill over into the next fiscal year, according to government document and sources.The privatisation of key companies, including BPCL, is a key part of government plans to pare the fiscal deficit, which has breached its target level just four months into the current fiscal year. Industry sources last year estimated the government's 53.29 per cent stake in BPCL could fetch $8 billion to $10 billion. With India's economy contracting by a record 23.9 per cent in the June quarter due to Covid-19, a delayed sale of BPCL could hinder the government's ability to generate funds for stimulus efforts aimed at restoring growth.Petroecuador monopoly endsQUITO: Ecuador's government will allow private companies to import and sell some fuels for industrial and commercial use, ending a monopoly state-owned Petroecuador had in the sector. The move is part of free-market reforms implemented in under President Lenin Moreno. The government is also seeking to merge Petroecuador with another state-owned company, and searching for a partner to refurbish Petroecuador's Esmeraldas refinery. The change will likely reduce the weight of fuel imports on public finances as cash-strapped Ecuador emerges from a restructuring of billions of dollars in bonds.© Copyright 2019 www.tradearabia.comCopyright 2020 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

| Jump to first hitConstruction was completed this summer on the US' second offshore wind project, a two-turbine, 12-megawatt (MW) pilot project built by Virginia's Dominion Energy utility and Danish wind developer Orsted.
The pilot project is the forerunner for a massive 2,600-MW project, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind (CVOW) that “at optimum times, (will be able to) generate enough electricity for 650,000 homes,” Rayhan Daudani, a Dominion Energy spokesperson, told JOC.com. The 14-MW, 222-meter (728-foot) rotor diameter turbines that will be used to build CVOW will be supplied by Siemens Gamesa, and construction should be finished by 2026.
Virginia is one of six Eastern seaboard states — along with New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Maryland — spearheading 15 projects expected to supply some 29,000 MW of electricity to US homes by 2035, according to the Business Network for Offshore Wind (BNOW). Foreign and domestic investors have been quietly pumping cash and expertise into these proposals, and ports and terminals determined to play a role in the nascent wind boom are announcing projects that will position them to handle and, in some cases, manufacture the massive wind turbines that will be deployed.
In Virginia, Orsted has signed a lease with the Virginia Port Authority to stage wind cargo at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal (PMT), “demonstrating to American companies seeking to reassure their operations, and to foreign companies seeking a US location” the value and benefits of being in Virginia, port CEO John Reinhart said during a State of the Port address on Thursday.
“We're looking at the potential to increase PMT’s role in the supply chain for offshore wind,” he said. “It could be part of a whole supply chain development, which will create jobs, thousands of jobs, if we can capture that in the offshore wind industry.”
Dominion Energy has also committed to building a Jones Act-compliant installation vessel, selecting in August the industrial manufacturer Huisman to supply the crane. “Huisman joins a consortium of offshore wind industry leaders led by Dominion Energy to build a Jones Act-compliant vessel, which is strategically important to the US offshore wind market,” the utility said in a statement.
First US standalone wind port
New Jersey is developing the US' first standalone offshore wind port, estimated to cost between $300 million and $400 million, according to Brian Sabina, senior vice president for economic transformation with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA). Construction of phase one, a 30-acre site for staging and marshalling cargo and a 25-acre manufacturing site at the mouth of the Delaware River, begins in 2021. Phase two will add 150-plus acres for expanded staging and on-site manufacturing of turbine components such as blades and nacelles, Sabina said.
Gigantic offshore turbine components will be partially assembled at the port and shipped out to wind farm sites to be further assembled into 850-foot towers, Sabina said. Crucially, there are no height obstructions to restrict equipment transport from port to site. “We’re all trying to build a new industry, and building the core infrastructure is critical to achieve our shared ambition,” Sabina told JOC.com. He said the wind port's wharves will have to accommodate up to 800 US tons, and that most existing port infrastructure along the East Coast is unable to handle that weight.
The New Jersey wind port “will pull from the pipeline of projects throughout the East Coast because these are [within] a day’s steaming distance of New Jersey,” Sabina said. “It is clear that our port will play a transformative role.” The project will make New Jersey “a hub of the East Coast wind industry,” BNOW's CEO and president Liz Burdock said in a NJEDA statement.
The first project under the state's target goal of 7,500 offshore wind MW to be built by 2035, the 1,100-MW Ocean Wind project, is now in development. Ocean Wind is jointly owned by Orsted and PSEG, a New Jersey utility. PSEG also owns the land for the proposed wind port. Ocean Wind will be built with GE Renewable Energy’s 12-MW Haliade-X turbines and will power 500,000 homes, according to Orsted's website.
New York in the mix
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo last year amped up his state's offshore wind target to 9,000 MW by 2035, according to BNOW, and the state has now committed to Equinor’s 816-MW Empire Wind project and to Orsted and Eversource’s 880-MW Sunrise Wind project. The two developers will also construct the 130-MW South Fork Wind Farm.
Joe Martens, director of the New York Offshore Wind Alliance (NYOWA), part of the state’s Alliance for Clean Energy (ACE), told JOC.com that Orsted has designated Port Jefferson on the North Shore of Long Island for operations and maintenance, while developer Equinor will be working with the 400-acre Port Coeymans, south of Albany on the Hudson River. BNOW said New York’s Homeport Pier, Staten Island’s Arthur Kill Terminal, and the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal may also participate. In his 2020 state-of-the-city speech, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pledged to invest $57 million into the South Brooklyn Terminal to support offshore wind construction.
British energy goliath BP, which is pivoting toward a low-carbon future, on Sept. 10 announced it will spend $1.1 billion on 50 percent stakes in two Equinor projects, the Empire Wind lease and the Beacon Wind lease, off the Massachusetts coast.
Further offshore
Massachusetts, third in the size of its offshore commitments after New York and New Jersey, has committed to building 3,200 MW by 2035. However, Massachusetts' ambitions were set back in August 2019 when the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) delayed the proposed Vineyard Wind’s final environmental impact statement (EIS). A new analysis is expected in December 2020.
Despite that, Massachusetts this year approved the 804-MW Mayflower Wind project, a joint venture of Shell and EDP Renewables, combining it with the Vineyard Wind project. The two projects would meet 12 percent of the state’s electricity needs, Steve Pike, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, told JOC.com. The two projects will use the Port of New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal for staging and construction of offshore wind turbines, he said.
In addition to participating in several wind projects, Connecticut is redeveloping the State Pier in New London into a wind hub for $157 million. The project partners are the Connecticut Port Authority, Gateway Terminal, Orsted, and Eversource. The state can procure up to 2,000 MW of offshore wind, according to regulatory authorities, and agreements already made will yield from 1,004 to 1,108 MW.
Maryland has two commercial-grade wind farms in development, the 120-MW Skipjack and the 240-MW MarWin, according to a state spokesperson. Skipjack developer Orsted is opening a Baltimore office and has agreed to develop an offshore wind staging center at Sparrows Point on the site of a former steel mill.

| Jump to first hitVietnam's approach to sustainable energy and the emergence of wind energy in the market offer tremendous opportunities for Norwegian companies.Commercial counsellor Arne-Kjetil Lian, director of Innovation Norway in Vietnam, shared with Vietnam Investment Review the prospects of Norwegian and Vietnamese companies in co-developing wind energy.How do you estimate the potential of Vietnam's renewable energy market for Norwegian investors?Vietnam has a more than 3,200km-long costal line which could become an important factor in the regional offshore wind supply chain. The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) has been in effect since August 1, so locally-manufactured wind power equipment such as towers and turbines can be exported to European territories under very favourable tariffs.However, the country seems to be not prepared for it yet. Last year, it was a pity that Vietnamese companies missed a chance to provide materials and equipment for a Taiwanese offshore wind project as they could not prove the required capacities and competences.Nevertheless, Vietnam is rich in offshore wind potential, estimated at 475GW. According to the highest growth scenario by the World Bank, offshore wind can accommodate 5 and 27% of national power demand by 2030 and 2050, respectively. To materialise this potential, Vietnam should build up its own offshore wind supply chain as soon as possible, and Norway is in a unique position to help with this endeavour.What strengths does Norway bring to the table to help Vietnam?Vietnam and Norway have similarities in size and their long coastlines. Both countries have a substantial oil and gas industry, and the ocean economy plays an important role. Norway has one of the world's most developed petroleum industries with state-of-the-art technology, contributing about 50% to the country's total export income. Norway wants to leverage its competences within offshore activities in the oil and gas sector and transform and develop offshore wind power projects with this experience.Equinor, the largest Norwegian state-owned oil and gas corporation, is an example for successfully transferring experience from oil and gas into offshore wind projects. Thanks to a well-developed offshore wind supply chain, Equinor was able to reduce investment cost of offshore wind projects by 60 per cent in comparison with the first projects. Last year, the company and its partner SSE were awarded contracts to develop three large-scale offshore wind projects in the Dogger Bank region of the North Sea.This will be the world's biggest offshore wind farm with a total installed capacity of 3.6GW. The clearing prices for these projects were US$51 per MWh for Creyke Beck A and £42 ($54) per MWh for the Creyke Beck B.Thus, Norway can share its experience of moving from oil and gas to offshore wind and help Vietnam to develop its offshore wind industry and supply chain.What are the possibilities for both countries' companies to boost cooperation in the renewable energy field?There are huge opportunities for Norwegian companies to cooperate with Vietnamese ones through partnership arrangements in which Norwegians will provide technology, designs, and support to local partners, who can then manufacture steel structures and equipment with international standards at affordable cost.As a result, Norwegian companies and its local partners can gradually build up Vietnam's offshore wind supply chain to provide goods and services for the entire offshore wind industry in the region.For instance, Slåttland Vietnam has a fruitful partnership with Vietnamese companies. Slåttland has entered Vietnam in 2008 and started with a small office in the southern province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau. Later on, the company developed its business model and cooperated with seven local companies there to produce subsea mechanical structures for export.Moreover, Slåttland provides designs and supervision to local partners. Meanwhile, Vietnamese companies provide labour, machines, and warehouses. - VOV"

When Bernard Looney makes his longawaited pitch to investors on the future of BP this week, the chief executive is expected to hammer home one message: that BP will be a stronger company when it produces less oil and gas.
Since the veteran oil man took the helm in February, he has promoted with unlikely passion the transformation of BP into a diversified energy producer fit for the 21st century, even as US rivals are still pinning their success on an oilfuelled future.
BP's target of net zero emissions by 2050, the move to write billions of dollars off the value of oil and gas assets, and its pledge to cut production by 40 per cent in the next decade have won plaudits from unusual corners. Plans to increase investments in renewables 10-fold in the coming years and the move away from oil were even praised by environmental activists Greenpeace, which has called for greater action against climate change. . Now the 50-year-old Irishman, who started as a drilling engineer at the company 29 years ago, has to demonstrate he can steer BP through the energy transition and still deliver value, while taking with him both the millennial data scientists and roughneck oil drillers still competing over the company's future.
""There has been a lot of excitement about what we have done in the last six to eight months,"" Mr Looney told the Financial Times. ""[But] there is a very simple message: we need to execute.""
He recognised he has to move quickly. A hint of what this might entail came on Thursday, when BP announced a $1.1bn deal with Norway's Equinor to acquire a stake in US offshore wind farms. More acquisitions are likely.
Critics assumed the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in the oil price, from $70 a barrel to below $20 in April and $40 today, would complicate BP's plans to reinvent itself.
In August, BP was forced to cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. It slashed capital spending, issued billions of dollars worth of bonds and announced 10,000 job cuts as part of a big restructuring. The company's $41bn debt pile is also among the highest in the sector. Mr Looney said he remained undeterred, saying the virus only ""reinforces the need for us to change"". A big question for investors is how BP will generate its cash and if wind, solar and other green strategies can eventually replace oil revenues. As Ben Caldecott, director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme, said: ""Investors want to see significant downpayments on the future strategy, such as the Equinor deal, but they also want proof that they [BP] can deliver financially.""
Mr Looney has taken a twin-track strategy, wanting to reassure investors he is not abandoning oil and gas while at the same time warning them not to underestimate BP's ability to extract revenues from new businesses.
""In 2030, BP will still be a major producer of hydrocarbons,"" said Mr Looney, estimating it will be producing 1.5m barrels of oil equivalent a day, down from 2.6m today, excluding its 20 per cent stake in Russia's Rosneft.
BP will keep directing the bulk of its $14bn-$16bn in capital spending towards oil and gas, but will aim to boost renewables spending to a third of the total by 2030. ""It takes capital to transition and reinvent ourselves,"" he said. ""We can't turn the tap off overnight.""
Mr Looney added that in the meantime, investors should not expect a fire sale of legacy assets to generate cash. A $12bn hybrid bond issue and the $5.5bn sale of its petrochemical business to Ineos mean pressure to fast-track its $25bn divestment plan has eased.
He is also maintaining his predecessor Bob Dudley's mantra of ""value over volume"", keeping only the oil and gas assets with the highest rate of return. ""We will sell things when there is a good market, not because we have to,"" he said.
Investors would have to expect — and accept — a lower return on investment, said Mr Looney. Renewable businesses can still generate returns of 8-10 per cent compared with the 15 per cent historically targeted for new hydrocarbon projects.
Bernstein analyst Oswald Clint said the market was split on the viability of matching 2019's revenues by 2030 with a far smaller contribution from oil and gas, but added there was a growing recognition that renewables can offer steadier returns, given the volatility in oil prices over the past decade. ""The 15 per cent returns promised on oil and gas projects rarely, if ever, materialised, as every eight years or so you'd get a dramatic crash in oil prices,"" Mr Clint said. ""The 10 per cent they are targeting in renewable projects is a lot more stable.""
Some analysts want more detail, fearing BP is making optimistic assumptions. Lydia Rainforth at Barclays said while BP's broad plan was attractive ""in theory"", returns of 8-10 per cent from renewables ""appear ... ambitious"" as competition grows in the sector.
Critics also question BP's competitive advantage in renewables. Giulia Chierchia, BP head of strategy and sustainability, said last month the ""ability to scale at pace"" and the pandemic's impact on finances remain risk factors.

When Bernard Looney makes his longawaited pitch to investors on the future of BP this week, the chief executive is expected to hammer home one message: that BP will be a stronger company when it produces less oil and gas.
Since the veteran oil man took the helm in February, he has promoted with unlikely passion the transformation of BP into a diversified energy producer fit for the 21st century, even as US rivals are still pinning their success on an oilfuelled future.
BP's target of net zero emissions by 2050, the move to write billions of dollars off the value of oil and gas assets, and its pledge to cut production by 40 per cent in the next decade have won plaudits from unusual corners. Plans to increase investments in renewables 10-fold in the coming years and the move away from oil were even praised by environmental activists Greenpeace, which has called for greater action against climate change. . Now the 50-year-old Irishman, who started as a drilling engineer at the company 29 years ago, has to demonstrate he can steer BP through the energy transition and still deliver value, while taking with him both the millennial data scientists and roughneck oil drillers still competing over the company's future.
""There has been a lot of excitement about what we have done in the last six to eight months,"" Mr Looney told the Financial Times. ""[But] there is a very simple message: we need to execute."" He recognised he has to move quickly. A hint of what this might entail came on Thursday, when BP announced a $1.1bn deal with Norway's Equinor to acquire a stake in US offshore wind farms. More acquisitions are likely.
Critics assumed the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse in the oil price, from $70 a barrel to below $20 in April and $40 today, would complicate BP's plans to reinvent itself.
In August, BP was forced to cut its dividend for the first time in a decade. It slashed capital spending, issued billions of dollars worth of bonds and announced 10,000 job cuts as part of a big restructuring. The company's $41bn debt pile is also among the highest in the sector. Mr Looney said he remained undeterred, saying the virus only ""reinforces the need for us to change"". A big question for investors is how BP will generate its cash and if wind, solar and other green strategies can eventually replace oil revenues. As Ben Caldecott, director of the Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme, said: ""Investors want to see significant downpayments on the future strategy, such as the Equinor deal, but they also want proof that they [BP] can deliver financially.""
Mr Looney has taken a twin-track strategy, wanting to reassure investors he is not abandoning oil and gas while at the same time warning them not to underestimate BP's ability to extract revenues from new businesses.

BP projected Monday that global oil demand may have already peaked, marking the latest development in the supermajor's strategy to transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy.
BP shares fell 2.1% in London trading and its stock is down 46% year-to-date, similar to other energy companies devastated by the coronavirus-driven collapse in oil demand. Its peer Royal Dutch Shell also fell 1.9% on Monday is 52% down so far in 2020.
The back story. After becoming chief executive of BP in February, Bernard Looney set a goal for the energy giant: become carbon neutral by 2050, including fuel burned by customers. The goal, ambitious for any company, let alone one in the business of hydrocarbons, marked BP out from the rest of the world's major oil companies in its commitment to combating climate change and emphasizing renewable energy as key to the company's future.
BP has since put its money where its mouth is. In August it pledged to increase low-carbon investment tenfold to $5 billion a year by 2030. Earlier this month, it paid $1.1 billion to Norwegian energy giant Equinor for a 50% stake in two of that company's wind farm developments on the East Coast of the United States.

BP Enters Offshore Wind Market With $1.1 Billion Equinor Deal. Why The Stock Is Falling.

What's new. In its influential annual energy outlook report, published Monday, BP outlined three projections for the future of global oil demand, all of which predict a decline in demand over the next 30 years. The report doubled down on the company's commitment to leading a global energy transition while remaining profitable.
The most conservative case, called ""business as usual,"" predicts that oil demand will rebound from the dip brought on by the coronavirus, plateauing in the 2020s and beginning to decline after 2030. The two other scenarios, which presume government policies to combat climate change, show global oil demand failing to recover from the coronavirus slump and leading a sharp long-term decline.
Looking ahead. The report lays out much of the nuts and bolts rationale behind BP's strategy to transition away from fossil fuels. It should reassure investors that the decision to go carbon neutral is backed by hard economic logic.

Of course, BP's strategy to transition away from its core business of oil may worry investors in the short term. After all, oil companies have historically enjoyed a healthy cash flow from the lucrative oil and gas business which translates into strong dividends for investors.
But in some ways, that is just the point: the writing is on the wall, and some short term sacrifice in terms of profitability may be needed to ensure the company is around for the long haul. This report, and BP's recent investment into Equinor's wind assets, should embolden investors to stick around with an energy company that is serious about a renewable future.

Bernard Looney was not just spouting hot air last month on BP's results call. Yesterday the new boss of the UK oil producer announced the $1.1bn purchase of a stake in US offshore wind projects from Equinor. The deal looks good for both sides. Mr Looney can point to a large renewables investment and the Norwegian group gets a big chunk of money.
A billion dollars shows commitment by BP. But not everyone thinks Mr Looney has made the correct call. The deal may be emblematic of the group's status as a Johnny-come-lately in clean energy. There are obvious similarities between unfashionable hydrocarbon projects and all-conquering offshore wind. In both cases, a pioneer invites in new investors to reduce risk. The key difference is that offshore wind's revenue streams are much less volatile.
BP has bought half of two early-stage projects, Empire off New York and Beacon off Massachusetts. Each has two phases. Empire I already has a power price agreement at a steep $99 per megawatt hour for 25 years. Together, the projects could eventually generate 4.4 gigawatts of power.
Equinor is showing clearly how to profit from renewable energy: move early. Equinor will book a capital gain of about $1bn, having spent just $177m on US federal lease auctions for both Empire and Beacon. Shareholders applauded and its stock rose 4 per cent. Internal returns on investment for BP should approach 10 per cent, but only by using plenty of debt and careful cost control. With profits in hand, Equinor should beat that.
However, BP is getting some great PR ahead of investor presentations next week. Equinor has promised to work with the UK oil major on other wind farms around the world.
Understandably, both sides are extolling the growth potential for offshore wind power capacity, a near seven multiple over today's 30GW by 2030. Keeping returns up will be the next test, as oil majors belatedly scramble for market share."

BP has made its first foray into offshore wind power, agreeing to buy a 50 per cent stake in two US projects from Norway's Equinor for $1.1bn.
The decision to take a stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets comes as BP seeks to boost annual investment in low-carbon businesses 10-fold to about $5bn a year.
BP plans to increase renewable power development from 2.5 gigawatts in 2019 to about 50GW by 2030 after chief executive Bernard Looney laid out ambitions for the company to become a netzero emissions company by 2050.
Mr Looney has said he wants to ""reinvent"" the group as pressure to tackle climate change rises in the oil and gas industry. ""This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy,"" Mr Looney said yesterday.
The deal is set to close in early 2021. European oil and gas companies have pushed ahead with clean energy plans despite the pandemic as fuel demand fell after travel bans and lockdowns.
Investors, environmentalists and the public are demanding that fossil fuel companies make drastic changes to their models to reduce emissions, even as customer demand for oil, gas and even coal remains robust.
BP and Equinor have cut dividends to shareholders and spending on legacy business as they buffer themselves from a slide in earnings, while increasing lowcarbon expenditure. While BP was seen by observers as moving too soon with its ""beyond petroleum"" drive under former chief executive John Browne, critics now say it is too far behind rivals and playing catch-up will be costly.
Last month BP said it would partner with other companies to further its clean energy ambitions, acquiring talent and tech while building joint ventures.
The US offshore wind sector is in its infancy. Only two small projects have been constructed along the Atlantic coast.
The first commercial-size development, the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind, has been delayed as the Trump administration conducts an extended review of its environmental impact. But developers see promise as coastal states set aggressive mandates for zerocarbon energy.
New York state last year signed a contract with Equinor to back Empire Wind, part of a plan to add 9GW of offshore wind by 2035. About 22GW of generating capacity is ""reasonably foreseeable"" in federal Atlantic waters, the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has said.
As part of the agreement announced yesterday, BP and Equinor will also jointly develop four assets offshore New York and Massachusetts that could generate power for more than 2m homes. Equinor, which will remain the operator of the projects, recently appointed a new chief executive tasked with accelerating the state-controlled oil and gas group's push into renewable energy.
It has set ambitions to raise its renewables capacity to up to 16GW by 2035. See LexLooney is looking to increase renewable power development to 50GW by 2030

BP has made its first foray into offshore wind power, agreeing to buy a 50 per cent stake in two US projects from Norway's Equinor for $1.1bn.
The decision to take a stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind assets comes as BP seeks to boost annual investment in low-carbon businesses 10-fold to about $5bn a year.
BP plans to increase renewable power development from 2.5 gigawatts in 2019 to about 50GW by 2030 after chief executive Bernard Looney laid out ambitions for the company to become a netzero emissions company by 2050.
Mr Looney has said he wants to ""reinvent"" the group as pressure to tackle climate change rises in the oil and gas industry. ""This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy,"" Mr Looney said yesterday.
The deal is set to close in early 2021. European oil and gas companies have pushed ahead with clean energy plans despite the pandemic as fuel demand fell after travel bans and lockdowns.
Investors, environmentalists and the public are demanding that fossil fuel companies make drastic changes to their models to reduce emissions, even as customer demand for oil, gas and even coal remains robust.
BP and Equinor have cut dividends to shareholders and spending on legacy business as they buffer themselves from a slide in earnings, while increasing lowcarbon expenditure. While BP was seen by observers as moving too soon with its ""beyond petroleum"" drive under former chief executive John Browne, critics now say it is too far behind rivals and playing catch-up will be costly.
Last month BP said it would partner with other companies to further its clean energy ambitions, acquiring talent and tech while building joint ventures.
The US offshore wind sector is in its infancy. Only two small projects have been constructed along the Atlantic coast.
The first commercial-size development, the 800-megawatt Vineyard Wind, has been delayed as the Trump administration conducts an extended review of its environmental impact. But developers see promise as coastal states set aggressive mandates for zerocarbon energy.
New York state last year signed a contract with Equinor to back Empire Wind, part of a plan to add 9GW of offshore wind by 2035. About 22GW of generating capacity is ""reasonably foreseeable"" in federal Atlantic waters, the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has said.
As part of the agreement announced yesterday, BP and Equinor will also jointly develop four assets offshore New York and Massachusetts that could generate power for more than 2m homes. Equinor, which will remain the operator of the projects, recently appointed a new chief executive tasked with accelerating the state-controlled oil and gas group's push into renewable energy.

Bernard Looney was not just spouting hot air last month on BP's results call. Yesterday the new boss of the UK oil producer announced the $1.1bn purchase of a stake in US offshore wind projects from Equinor. The deal looks good for both sides. Mr Looney can point to a large renewables investment and the Norwegian group gets a big chunk of money.
A billion dollars shows commitment by BP. But not everyone thinks Mr Looney has made the correct call. The deal may be emblematic of the group's status as a Johnny-come-lately in clean energy. There are obvious similarities between unfashionable hydrocarbon projects and all-conquering offshore wind. In both cases, a pioneer invites in new investors to reduce risk. The key difference is that offshore wind's revenue streams are much less volatile.
BP has bought half of two early-stage projects, Empire off New York and Beacon off Massachusetts. Each has two phases. Empire I already has a power price agreement at a steep $99 per megawatt hour for 25 years. Together, the projects could eventually generate 4.4 gigawatts of power.
Equinor is showing clearly how to profit from renewable energy: move early. Equinor will book a capital gain of about $1bn, having spent just $177m on US federal lease auctions for both Empire and Beacon. Shareholders applauded and its stock rose 4 per cent.

The deal marks the start of an offshore-wind investment partnership in the region for the two companies, which have been at the forefront of the rapid changes in the oil industry as companies seek to adapt to the realities of climate change.
BP has taken the boldest steps so far in abandoning the oil-supermajor business model. Just six months after taking the helm, chief executive Bernard Looney said in August he'd shrink oil and gas output by 40 per cent over the next decade and spend as much as US$5 billion a year building one of the world's largest renewable-power businesses.
BP will receive a 50 per cent stake in the Empire Wind and Beacon Wind developments off New York and Massachusetts, respectively, the companies said in two separate statements on Thursday. Equinor will retain 50 per cent in both, and continue to be the operator.
Empire Wind, whose first phase could start in 2024-25, has a potential installed capacity of more than 2 gigawatts, and Beacon Wind more than 2.4 gigawatts. Together they'll be able to power more than two million homes.
Equinor earlier estimated total investments in Empire Wind's first phase at about US$3 billion.
The companies plan to participate in more offshore wind projects in the U.S., bringing together their significant balance sheets and experience of handling large projects.
""Our ambition would be to replicate this across the U.S.,"" Dev Sanyal, executive vice president for gas and low-carbon energy at BP, said in an interview.
""States are going through their own process of looking at the offshore wind sector, and as offshore leases come available both of us would like to be a part of that.""
Norway's state-controlled Equinor has so far been the most aggressive oil major in offshore wind, seeking to capitalize on its experience in operating big industrial projects at sea.
It's now reaping the rewards of its early-mover status, expecting to book a US$1-billion gain from the BP transaction.
Equinor last year sold half its stake in a wind farm off Germany, recouping its initial investment.
Bloomberg has also reported that the company is in talks to reduce its stake in what will be the world's biggest offshore wind farm in the U.K.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Last month, oil and gas giant BP laid out the theory of how it aims to become a clean-energy company. Now it has served up a taste of what that might mean in practice.
On Thursday, the U.K.-listed company said it was buying into two undeveloped wind farms in the waters off New York and Massachusetts, its first foray into the booming offshore wind sector. BP will pay $1.1 billion to its Norwegian peer Equinor for half of its Beacon and Empire wind projects, which are expected to start producing power by the mid-2020s. The companies will also form a partnership to ""pursue other offshore opportunities together in the fast-growing U.S. market.""
The move is a signal of intent for BP's low-carbon plans, coming just before the group's (three!) capital markets days next week. It gives a real-life example of how the company plans to fulfill its ambition to sell integrated low-carbon power packages to companies and cities -- one of the two green businesses it wants to develop.
It is no surprise that BP is buying into a shared megaproject. Many big oil and gas exploration projects are group undertakings, an approach that spreads the risks. A partnership to pool skills -- trading from BP, offshore wind from Equinor -- is more unusual. It has similarities to BP's arrangements with its solar-energy partner, Lightsource BP. A key difference is that BP holds a 50% stake in Lightsource, while there aren't cross-shareholdings in the Equinor deal.
BP also needs the scale: It has a very ambitious target to expand its renewable generating capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2030 from 2.5 gigawatts. The wind farms in the Equinor deal will have 4.4 gigawatts total capacity across the two projects when completed.
Many more deals will be required to fulfill BP's ambition. With green investments, including wind, becoming increasingly popular, this could be costly. BP paid up for its share of Equinor's assets, but the deal isn't a huge chunk of its annual capital spending. Assuming the $1.1 billion is equally apportioned across both wind farms, the BP buy-in raises Equinor's return on equity from the Empire project to 16% from 11%, including project finance, according to Citi. BP's return is closer to 9%.
Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, was an early mover in the transition to low-carbon energy, while BP was a laggard by European standards. Rival companies Total and Royal Dutch Shell have been at it for a few years. The British group's need to move quickly now may cost it, though it might also gain from a fraction more clarity about what the shift could look like.
There are no easy answers to the conundrum of energy transition for the major oil companies or their investors: Business as usual risks sinking cash into finding new oil and gas reserves that might eventually prove worthless, while green-energy investments could focus on things that turn out to offer paltry returns.
Still, BP's experience offers one lesson for U.S. oil companies Exxon and Chevron, which for now are sticking to oil and gas: If they do decide to join the green revolution at a later date, they might find it more expensive.

BP stock fell on Thursday, as the oil major entered the offshore wind market in a $1.1 billion deal with Norwegian energy giant Equinor.
The FTSE 100-listed company has agreed to buy 50% stakes in two of Equinor's wind farm developments on the U.S. East Coast—the Empire Wind project in New York and the Beacon Wind farm in Massachusetts.
The two companies have also formed a strategic partnership to pursue further opportunities for offshore wind in the U.S.
The back story. In February—shortly after Bernard Looney became its chief executive—BP set out an action plan to become net zero on carbon by 2050. The company ramped up its strategy last month, saying it won't explore in any new countries and announcing a tenfold increase in low-carbon investment to $5 billion a year by 2030.
BP
reported a $16.8 billion loss
in the second quarter and cut its dividend for the first time in a decade as the coronavirus pandemic caused oil demand and prices to collapse. The oil major also lowered its long-term oil price forecasts, as it warned weaker energy demand could last for a ""sustained period.""
What's new. BP's agreement with Norway's Equinor ties into its new green strategy. The company will become co-owner of two U.S. wind farm developments, which Equinor said will together generate up to 4.4 gigawatts—enough power for more than 2 million homes. BP's strategy aims for 50 gigawatts by 2030, a 20-fold increase from 2019.

Looney said: ""This is an important early step in the delivery of our new strategy and our pivot to truly becoming an integrated energy company. Offshore wind is growing at around 20% a year globally and is recognized as being a core part of meeting the world's need to limit emissions."" Equinor will operate both projects through the development, construction and operation phases.
Looking ahead. Berenberg analysts said the $1.1 billion price paid by BP ""appears quite high,"" but enables the company to move into the growing sector. ""BP has a target to get to 50 gigawatts of renewable power generation capacity by 2030 and offshore wind will be an important part of that,"" they said. Lower oil prices early on Thursday also put the stock and the wider sector under pressure. Shares in BP fell 0.4% in early trading, and are now 45% down year-to-date, while Equinor stock edged 0.3% higher.
BP may have paid a high price to enter the offshore wind market, but it is in the game and seems serious about executing its low-carbon strategy and being at the forefront of the global energy transition.

Equinor has appointed a new chief executive to succeed Eldar Saetre. The latter did well for investors, with shares in the big Norwegian energy group outperforming during periods of declining oil prices. A growing contribution to earnings from wind power partly explains the appeal to shareholders.
Equinor does not just find hydrocarbons, it sources decent chief executives too. Its latest, Eldar Saetre, is retiring after six years. During his tenure and that of predecessor Helge Lund's, the oil group delivered a total return of 250 per cent to shareholders led by the government of Norway. That far exceeds the MSCI All Country energy benchmark. Anders Opedal, Mr Saetre's successor, has big roustabout's boots to fill.
Mr Saetre's effort is particularly impressive given that the oil price collapsed not once but twice on his watch. He took over Equinor, as Statoil is now known, in October 2014, when Brent crude was collapsing from $115 per barrel. He leaves in a year when oil has plunged by a third.
Mr Opedal has two interlinked briefs. First, make Equinor, a producer of dirty brown energy, a lot greener. Second, decide what to do with the international oil and gas portfolio.
Mr Saetre has already impaired US operations by $10bn alone. It is piquant to remember that Mr Lund, now a green evangelist as chairman of BP, once increased Equinor's exposure to mucky US shale oil.
Equinor has cut its carbon emissions in Norway partly by using hydroelectric power on its rigs. Mr Opedal has promised to do more. But in North America and Brazil, Mr Opedal could find carbon savings harder to achieve. International operations account for a third of group output. He should reduce that.
Profits from renewables need to go up to compensate for falling hydrocarbon returns. Green energy should provide 4 per cent of operating cash flow by 2025, more than doubling by 2030, says Bernstein. Most will come from wind power. Equinor has a serious business here. By 2025 it should generate as much as Danish specialist Orsted does today. All this presumes that oil prices do not plunge further.

Eldar Saetre has resigned after six years as chief executive of Equinor, with his successor primed to accelerate a push for Norway's state-controlled oil and gas group into renewable energy.
Anders Opedal, a 23-year veteran of Equinor who is currently head of technology, projects and drilling, will take over from the 64-year-old Mr Saetre in November when he retires after four decades at the company.
""Equinor is entering a phase of significant change as the world needs to take more forceful action to combat climate change,"" chairman Jon Erik Reinhardsen said yesterday. ""Anders is the right person to further develop Equinor as a force in the green shift.""
Mr Opedal, who has also been chief operating officer, has worked across the legacy oil business, including in Brazil and the newer renewables divisions. He said he was confident of the company's ""ability to change and continue creating long-term value for our shareholders also in a low-carbon future"".
He added: ""Together, we will accelerate the development of Equinor as a broad energy company and our growth within renewables.""
The biggest European oil companies are under mounting pressure from investors, environmental activists and the wider public to take greater responsibility for their role in climate change. Equinor has pledged to halve the carbon intensity of the energy it produces by 2050 and has net-zero emissions goals. But it has not gone as far as overhauling its long-term price assumptions that have triggered billions of dollars in impairments among rivals.
Mr Saetre, a former finance director at the company previously known as Statoil, was initially reluctant to become chief executive but has steered the group through two sharp falls in the oil price and oversaw the development of Johan Sverdrup, an offshore oil project, which is expected to be a core revenue generator for Equinor for many years to come. He also led the company in its pursuit to become a large participant in offshore wind power generation.
Equinor is the largest oil and gas group on the Norwegian continental shelf but faces questions about its Arctic exploration plans in the Barents Sea, as well as its international operations after heavy losses in its North American business, including oil sands and shale. The company's finances have taken a massive hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Equinor, which was the first among its peers to slash its dividend, reported a nearly 90 per cent plunge in adjusted earnings before interest and tax to $350m in the second quarter. See Lex

In previous energy downturns, prices slumped but companies kept faith in their oil and gas investments. This time it might be different, as the prospect sinks in that the pandemic's impact will endure.
Executives are shifting from crisis response to the longer-term outlook.
Royal Dutch Shell warned this week that it would slash up to $22bn from the value of its assets, a move that followed BP's announcement that it could take a $17.5bn hit.
As the coronavirus cash crunch focuses minds, businesses — at least in Europe — also believe that the crisis will only accelerate the energy transition towards cleaner fuels.
""These companies have decided that some of the assets they have today are worth a lot less than they thought a year ago. In fact, not only are some of them worth a lot less, they are worth nothing,"" said Luke Parker at consultancy Wood-Mackenzie.
Rather than a mere accounting technicality, he says that the adjustments to medium and longer-term prices are a sign of upheaval in the sector that deals another blow to the investment case for hydrocarbon producers.
""Demand might still grow from here, and many companies are still chasing a share of that growth,"" said Mr Parker. ""But make no mistake, the likes of Shell and BP are already ushering in the twilight years.""
Executives who for years rejected the prospect of ""stranded assets"" are acknowledging publicly the risk that swaths of their oil, gas and refining assets will be rendered uneconomic, with vast hydrocarbon reserves never being extracted and burnt.
Environmentalists and activist investors have pounced on this as the first real recognition from big energy that their businesses — despite still relatively robust demand for their products — are on a downward spiral.
The FT estimated earlier this year that unviable assets could amount to $900bn should governments aggressively seek to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Some observers say that the pandemic is ushering in a new era and the sum could be far higher.
Even before prices started to collapse, energy companies were cutting outlooks and planning asset writedowns late last year — from US oil major Chev-ron's $10bn in impairments to €4.8bn in charges from Spain's Repsol.
Some sceptics say the latest round of impairments, which do not affect companies' cash positions, are just a part of corporate accounting and a matter of convenience as they face an unprecedented financial crisis.
""The energy transition has a role in the impairments because a company ultimately has to take a view on longerterm oil prices,"" said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Redburn.
""But these latest writedowns are predominantly prudent accounting moves taken by the energy sector to reflect a lower price outlook for other reasons, notably the fallout from Covid.""
Many observers believe European oil majors' pre-crisis assumptions of longterm oil prices of $75-$90 a barrel were hugely optimistic, and that the current environment provided cover for a levelling out that was always inevitable. Others say for BP it was part of a process to clear the decks, freeing it to adjust corporate strategy and capital allocation plans under new chief executive Bernard Looney. Shell is also preparing for a big organisational restructuring.
Both companies have been keen to shrug off pressure from activist investors and environmentalists who have accused them of not taking adequate measures to overhaul their portfolios and accounts for the energy transition.
Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, said it would be a mistake to believe an accounting change necessarily indicates a fundamental shift in behaviour. ""The price assumptions used for backward-looking impairment tests are of limited importance. They do not necessarily speak to the ranges of price assumptions being used to make forward-looking investment decisions,"" said Mr Stansbury.
European groups are ahead of their US counterparts, although writedowns are expected across the shale sector. BP, Shell, Total and Repsol have taken steps to revise down their impairment price assumptions in the past year, with the energy transition and net-zero commitments at least partly driving decisions. Italy's Eni still has a long-term price assumption of $70 a barrel, while Norway's Equinor is banking on $80 oil, suggesting there may be more writedowns to come. The US oil groups do not disclose such assumptions.
As for the future, while some investors are keen that the majors wind down their hydrocarbon businesses and maximise shareholder returns, others back a diversification strategy.
""Any self-respecting CEO is unlikely to find self-liquidation an appealing thought,"" said Neil Beveridge at Bernstein. ""Why put yourself out of a job? The alternative is that the oil majors of today reinvent themselves.""
Carbon Tracker, a think-tank, said the current environment would at a minimum prompt companies to ask if certain projects were fit for a low-carbon world. High price assumptions may mask the financial risk to marginal projects, it says in a new report.
""Impairment prices should be consistent with investment strategy going forward,"" said Andrew Grant, the study's author. But some industry observers note that should investment collapse, supply will drop, leading in theory to a rebound in prices and returns. It is then that the true motives of energy companies will be revealed.
They will face a choice: whether to use that period to hasten the shift towards a greener future or to reinvest in existing hydrocarbon businesses that still provide the bulk of its cash.

European groups are ahead of their US counterparts, although writedowns are expected across the shale sector. BP, Shell, Total and Repsol have taken steps to revise down their impairment price assumptions in the past year, with the energy transition and net-zero commitments at least partly driving decisions. Italy's Eni still has a long-term price assumption of $70 a barrel, while Norway's Equinor is banking on $80 oil, suggesting there may be more writedowns to come. The US oil groups do not disclose such assumptions.
As for the future, while some investors are keen that the majors wind down their hydrocarbon businesses and maximise shareholder returns, others back a diversification strategy.
""Any self-respecting CEO is unlikely to find self-liquidation an appealing thought,"" said Neil Beveridge at Bernstein. ""Why put yourself out of a job? The alternative is that the oil majors of today reinvent themselves.""
Carbon Tracker, a think-tank, said the current environment would at a minimum prompt companies to ask if certain projects were fit for a low-carbon world. High price assumptions may mask the financial risk to marginal projects, it says in a new report.
""Impairment prices should be consistent with investment strategy going forward,"" said Andrew Grant, the study's author. But some industry observers note that should investment collapse, supply will drop, leading in theory to a rebound in prices and returns. It is then that the true motives of energy companies will be revealed.
They will face a choice: whether to use that period to hasten the shift towards a greener future or to reinvest in existing hydrocarbon businesses that still provide the bulk of its cash.

In previous energy downturns, prices slumped but companies kept faith in their oil and gas investments. This time it might be different, as the prospect sinks in that the pandemic's impact will endure.
Executives are shifting from crisis response to the longer-term outlook.
Royal Dutch Shell warned this week that it would slash up to $22bn from the value of its assets, a move that followed BP's announcement that it could take a $17.5bn hit.
As the coronavirus cash crunch focuses minds, businesses — at least in Europe — also believe that the crisis will only accelerate the energy transition towards cleaner fuels.
""These companies have decided that some of the assets they have today are worth a lot less than they thought a year ago. In fact, not only are some of them worth a lot less, they are worth nothing,"" said Luke Parker at consultancy Wood-Mackenzie.
Rather than a mere accounting technicality, he says that the adjustments to medium and longer-term prices are a sign of upheaval in the sector that deals another blow to the investment case for hydrocarbon producers.
""Demand might still grow from here, and many companies are still chasing a share of that growth,"" said Mr Parker. ""But make no mistake, the likes of Shell and BP are already ushering in the twilight years.""
Executives who for years rejected the prospect of ""stranded assets"" are acknowledging publicly the risk that swaths of their oil, gas and refining assets will be rendered uneconomic, with vast hydrocarbon reserves never being extracted and burnt.
Environmentalists and activist investors have pounced on this as the first real recognition from big energy that their businesses — despite still relatively robust demand for their products — are on a downward spiral.
The FT estimated earlier this year that unviable assets could amount to $900bn should governments aggressively seek to restrict the rise in global temperatures to 1.5C above preindustrial levels. Some observers say that the pandemic is ushering in a new era and the sum could be far higher.
Even before prices started to collapse, energy companies were cutting outlooks and planning asset writedowns late last year — from US oil major Chev-ron's $10bn in impairments to €4.8bn in charges from Spain's Repsol.
Some sceptics say the latest round of impairments, which do not affect companies' cash positions, are just a part of corporate accounting and a matter of convenience as they face an unprecedented financial crisis.
""The energy transition has a role in the impairments because a company ultimately has to take a view on longerterm oil prices,"" said Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Redburn.
""But these latest writedowns are predominantly prudent accounting moves taken by the energy sector to reflect a lower price outlook for other reasons, notably the fallout from Covid.""
Many observers believe European oil majors' pre-crisis assumptions of longterm oil prices of $75-$90 a barrel were hugely optimistic, and that the current environment provided cover for a levelling out that was always inevitable. Others say for BP it was part of a process to clear the decks, freeing it to adjust corporate strategy and capital allocation plans under new chief executive Bernard Looney. Shell is also preparing for a big organisational restructuring.
Both companies have been keen to shrug off pressure from activist investors and environmentalists who have accused them of not taking adequate measures to overhaul their portfolios and accounts for the energy transition.
Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at Legal & General Investment Management, said it would be a mistake to believe an accounting change necessarily indicates a fundamental shift in behaviour. ""The price assumptions used for backward-looking impairment tests are of limited importance. They do not necessarily speak to the ranges of price assumptions being used to make forward-looking investment decisions,"" said Mr Stansbury.
European groups are ahead of their US counterparts, although writedowns are expected across the shale sector.

Big oil and gas producers are charting different courses toward a lower-carbon future, all of them fraught with risk.
The world used to worry about ""peak oil,"" or running out of the stuff. Not any more: Supply has outstripped demand and it looks likely to stay that way. Royal Dutch Shell and BP, two of the world's five so-called supermajors, have significantly lowered their expected commodity prices in recent weeks,
forcing them to write off
about $39 billion worth of assets.
Energy demand will still grow with the global economy, but fossil fuels will be used less as economies decarbonize in an effort to slow climate change. The industry now talks of peak oil demand leaving ""stranded"" reserves that are uneconomic to exploit.
The Covid-19 crisis has only made such talk louder. Lockdowns cut energy demand, increasing the existing crude glut and sending prices tumbling. Production and capital spending were slashed to stabilize oil prices. It worked, but the volatility has compounded lenders' and investors' concerns that new exploration spending might not pay back.
Global supermajors all plan to keep pumping oil and gas in the near term, but they have different long-term strategies. Broadly speaking, Chevron, Exxon Mobil and most national producers are still focused on fossil fuels. European rivals, under greater pressure to help in the fight against climate change, eventually plan to become low-carbon energy producers. Both approaches raise uncomfortable questions for investors.
Producers can capitalize on existing skills, assets and market positions by sticking to their knitting. Even with drastic decarbonization, the world will need oil and gas for many years yet—this year's lockdowns only caused a near 20% drop in oil demand. Companies already have a lot of oil and gas reserves: 9 to 17 years worth for the five supermajors, over 20 years for Russian state producer Rosneft and 52 years for its Saudi peer Aramco.
The problem is that they plan to spend billions to find even more, despite the growing risk that investments will have to be written down. The likes of Aramco and Rosneft are likely to dominate as petroleum demand declines: They have plentiful, cheap-to-recover reserves and political priorities that come ahead of margins, such as generating jobs and government revenues. Independent producers could find it increasingly difficult to compete profitably.
This conundrum explains why European oil-and-gas companies are experimenting with lower-carbon energies such as renewable power or green hydrogen. BP and its French peer Total have acquired or joined with companies that install and run solar and wind projects. Shell is trying to build an integrated power business. All three are also
dabbling in hydrogen
. The investments are currently small, but start ramping up by 2030.
Such strategies align with a decarbonized future, but the return prospects hardly seem more certain than in the traditional business.
Supermajors excel at building multiyear, technically complex projects around the world. That's very different from most solar or wind farms, which require quick installation of standard technology, hence why they are buying in green know-how. Less mature clean-energy sectors such as hydrogen and geothermal may offer supermajors' engineers and geologists something to sink their teeth into, but remain at a more speculative stage of development.
FOURTH IN A SERIES
The energy industry will look very different in future as renewable power sources replace carbon fuels. The transition has built up unstoppable momentum, confronting investors with opportunities and challenges alike in sectors as wide-ranging as oil and gas, utilities and industrial technology.

Green Bonds Need the Right Filter

Orsted is a transition success story. Established in 1973 as the Danish Oil and Natural Gas company, it switched to renewable energy in 2017. The shares trade at over three times book value, compared with below par for European supermajors. Norwegian producer Equinor, formerly Statoil, has embarked on a similar path. But Orsted and Equinor are small. Like the tankers that transport their products, behemoths like Shell will be much harder to turn.
However the supermajors tackle the energy transition, they risk wasting cash on investments that might not bear fruit. That is unwelcome news for investors already digesting falling profits and
uncertain dividends
. The shares trade accordingly, trailing the broader index by a growing margin in both the U.S. and Europe.
For now, it remains hard to see that turning around. Supermajors used to be useful vehicles for smoothing out the bumps in oil and gas prices. With their core business now under threat, a smooth ride is the last thing investors can expect.

Mercenaries connected to the Russian government have joined forces with a rebel militia to hold Libya's largest oil field, European and Libyan officials said, prompting U.S. protests over foreign interference in the country's most strategic industry.
A convoy of vehicles carrying Russian and Sudanese mercenaries moved into the 300,000-barrels-a-day Sharara field late Thursday and joined forces with a militia loyal to the eastern Libya-based rebel commander Khalifa Haftar, the officials said. The field is operated by Spain's Repsol SA on behalf of Libya's state-run National Oil Corp., with France's Total SA, Norway's Equinor ASA and Austria's OMV AG owning minority stakes.
""Our workers are not allowed to resume production or resume maintenance work by the Libyan armed militias under the command of the Eastern authorities,"" Libya's NOC told The Wall Street Journal. ""We do not need Russian and other foreign mercenaries in Libyan oil fields whose goal is to prevent oil production.""
Equinor referred comments to NOC and the other companies didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Sharara field has become a prized asset in the six-year-long civil war between Mr. Haftar's forces and the official Libyan government. The oil field closed in January and briefly reopened earlier this month after forces that held the facility pledged loyalty to the central government in Tripoli, a move that undermined
other producers' efforts to rebalance oil markets
at the time.
After production resumed for two days, the facility was shut down again when fighters loyal to Mr. Haftar took control of the field on June 8, the officials said. With the arrival this week of experienced Russian fighters, Mr. Haftar will now be able to consolidate his control and keep the field closed, depriving the internationally-recognized government of vital revenue, the officials said.
The Russian fighters, the officials said, are part of
the Wagner Group
—a network of mercenaries connected to the Russian Defense Ministry. In Libya, the group's operations are overseen by Russia's military intelligence branch, one of them said.
Russian Defense Ministry officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The ministry has always denied any connection with Wagner.
The U.S. Embassy in Libya on Friday criticized what it called ""an unprecedented foreign-backed campaign to undermine Libya's energy sector and prevent the resumption of oil production.""
""We share the NOC's deep concern about the shameful interference of Wagner and other foreign mercenaries against NOC facilities and personnel at the al-Sharara oil field,"" the Embassy said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.
NOC said the field was also occupied by Sudanese mercenaries called ""Janjaweed,"" who are loyal to the government in Khartoum.
""Many countries are themselves benefiting from the absence of Libyan oil from global markets,"" said NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla, referring to recent efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia to curb global oil supply and lift prices.
""Some of them cynically express their public regret for Libya's continued inability to produce oil while all the time working in the background to support blockading forces,"" Mr. Sanalla said.
The arrival of Kremlin-aligned mercenaries also means Russia may now hold sway on assets partly owned by major European oil companies, European security officials. ""It's a dangerous step. The optics are terrible,"" one of them said.

| Jump to first hitThe coronavirus has exposed the fragility of some of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, but also given them the opportunity to make investors swallow some unpleasant remedies.
Since the pandemic started, BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have made drastic changes to their businesses, from multibillion-dollar writedowns to big cuts to dividends and jobs.
They explained these moves as responses to the dual threats of the lockdown-induced oil slump and the growing pressure to cut carbon emissions. Yet the decisions say as much about the companies'individual fragility as they do of the challenges faced by the broader industry.
The current crisis, according to some analysts and investors, has given BP and Shell the chance to clean house by reducing onerous shareholder payouts or adjusting unrealistic price assumptions.
""The BP announcement 'kitchen sinks'it, so that long-term investors can step in with much of the worst in the rear-view mirror,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member of investment management firm Great Hill Capital LLC.
BP announced on Monday the biggest writedown on the value of its business since the Deepwater Horizon disaster a decade ago. That came a week after the company said it would cut 10,000 jobs.
Chief executive Bernard Looney said the moves were necessary because oil and gas prices will be lower than expected in the coming decades as the coronavirus hurts long-term demand and accelerates the shift to cleaner energy.
His counterpart at Shell, Ben van Beurden, blamed the same factors for his difficult decision to cut the company's dividend for the first time since the Second World War. Several analysts and investors predicted BP will do the same before the current crisis is over.
""There has to be a chance that Mr Looney is softening up BP shareholders for a dividend cut,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""If investors really do buy into the new carbon-neutral strategy then they may be relatively forgiving of a reduction in the annual distribution, especially given the fall in oil and gas prices seen this year.""
The coronavirus pandemic and the push to cut carbon emissions each have the potential to reshape the industry, but some problems predate those twin crises.
In Shell's case, investors were already questioning the affordability of a US$15-billion annual dividend for a company that also planned to make massive investments in clean energy.
BP faces a similar challenge, plus a few other long-standing vulnerabilities.
The company revised its 2021-2050 price assumptions to US$55 a barrel for Brent crude and US$2.90 per million British thermal units for U.S. natural gas. Its previous long-term expectations of US$75 for oil and US$4 gas were already too high compared with prices in the last few years, said Allen Good, an equity analyst at Morningstar.
""In this light, the impairment charges are of little surprise,"" Good said.
But BP's assumptions aren't the highest among its European peers. Norway's state-controlled Equinor ASA, which has cut its dividend, assumes Brent prices of US$80 a barrel for 2030. They were last updated in the third quarter of 2019 and are tested on a yearly basis against International Energy Agency scenarios, the company said.
Italy's Eni SpA has a long-term price of US$70, which has remained unchanged ""for the last few years,"" according to the company's annual report. Assumptions at both Equinor and Eni ""must be under pressure,"" according to a review by research group Carbon Tracker Initiative. France's Total SA sees crude at US$70 by mid-decade, falling to US$50 by 2050.
""It is one of the grey areas of oil and gas accounting,"" said Keith Myers, president of research at Westwood Global Energy Group. ""It's very much down to the discretion of an oil company to choose its oil-price forecast that it uses for impairment tests, and there's no consistency between oil companies.""
BP has also been carrying a heavier debt burden than its rivals. After the writedowns, its gearing - the ratio of debt to equity - would increase to 48 per cent, by far the highest in the industry, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria.
Every company is grappling with long-term shifts in energy consumption and prices, and the recent announcements by BP and Shell are a genuine response to that challenge.
""Big picture, we see this as another step in the re-rating of oil and gas, and the journey from Big Oil to Big Energy,"" said Luke Parker, vice-president of corporate analysis at Wood Mackenzie Ltd.
But not all of the oil majors have the same urgent need to adapt.
BP's ""peers have more options and time to survive the current environment without a dividend cut,"" Borkhataria said.

| Jump to first hitEquinor ... a leader in sustainability Oil and gas companies are facing increasing scrutiny for their carbon intensive operations. With the passing of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Framework, the demand for the oil and gas industry to curb its carbon emissions is becoming even stronger. Companies that implement concrete measures to reduce their environmental impact are best placed to succeed in the coming years, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.GlobalData’s latest thematic report, ‘Sustainability in Oil & Gas’, reflects that the environmental threat of oil and gas industry is widely recognised and various governments have initiated preventive measures to mitigate it. Subsequently, many oil and gas companies are taking steps to curb the environmental impact, primarily due to regulatory and shareholder obligations. However, when it comes to social and governance factors, there appears to be a distinct differentiation in the way different companies handle these issues.Large oil and gas corporations have undertaken social welfare activities as per their individual CSR portfolios. There is a conscious effort to bridge the gender gap in workplaces, maintain diversity and ensure overall wellbeing of the employees. Increased accountability has improved overall governance across the oil and gas value chain.Ravindra Puranik, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, says: “Oil majors and other multinationals have adopted best practices in ensuring employee health and safety. However, the same is not true in case of the national oil companies. Many of these companies also lag on the corporate governance front as their operations are prone to corruption and crony capitalism.”GlobalData’s thematic research identifies that Equinor, Shell, ExxonMobil, Total, Chevron and OMV are among the leaders in the sustainability theme in the oil and gas industry.The outbreak of COVID-19 has put workforce wellbeing at the center stage. Oilfield workers in many regions have contracted the disease, highlighting the importance of social sustainability. The pandemic has also raised governance challenges as different companies have adopted different approaches at handling this unprecedented crisis.Puranik concludes: “Adopting a holistic approach can help company leaders to ensure all aspects of sustainability are covered in their ESG strategy. In 2020, the pressure will mount on companies to be more transparent about their ESG credentials.” -- Tradearabia News ServiceCopyright 2020 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

When things are so bleak in the oil industry that you can't afford to file for bankruptcy
Last week, I learned that you actually have to pay a ton of money to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
Among the costs are steep fees for lawyers, financial advisors, and industry consultants. 
Some energy companies might not be able to afford to file, according to a partner at the law firm Allen & Overy. Oil has recovered its April losses, but it's still down about 50%.
What happens if you can't afford Chapter 11? You might be forced to file for Chapter 7 instead, a far more dire form of bankruptcy, according to Ken Coleman, head of Allen & Overy's US restructuring and banking group.
Essentially, Chapter 7 is a fire sale. Your business gets liquidated, instead of being restructured.Coleman said this downturn will see more Chapter 7 filings than previous ones. The problem, he says, is that a lot of these companies won't have an apparent exit — a problem we explain in detail here. 
OK, but: Chapter 7 filings will still be rare, another lawyer told me.
Small companies in the oilfield services industry will be most likely to file for Chapter 7, Patrick Hughes of the law firm Haynes and Boone, said. Far more likely than chapter 7 filings will be creditors converting debt to equity, he added. 
Phrase of the day: ""Naked 363 sale.""
Sign me up! Just kidding. This is actually bad. Section 363 of the bankruptcy code is the provision that allows you to sell assets or whole businesses, Coleman said. What makes it naked is when there's no buyer. It's basically like an auction, he said. Similar to the protection that lenders have when they provide financing, buyers in a 363 sale also get added protection.""That's why you see a lot of sales that could otherwise happen outside of a bankruptcy happen inside of bankruptcy because the buyer wants those special benefits,"" Coleman said. A $400 billion hole in energy investment 
At the start of 2020, the International Energy Agency estimated that capital investment in energy would grow by 2% this year.
Wrong!
How wrong? ""2020 is now set to see the largest decline in energy investment on record,"" the IEA said in a report this week.
The agency is expecting a reduction of one-fifth, or almost $400 billion, in capital spending, relative to last year.
Is this shocking? Not really, considering that oil accounts for half of consumer spending on energy, and as we know, oil crashed. But a few figures from the IEA report are.
The agency projects that spending on oil will fall by more than $1 trillion this year. ""Among other implications, this would mean an historic switch in 2020 as electricity becomes the largest single element of consumer spending on energy,"" the agency wrote. 
How do renewables stack up? Better than oil, at least. Investment in renewable projects is expected to fall by 10% this year, the IEA said, far less than the overall decline in investment of 20% across the energy sector.
IEA expects an investment of about $280 billion in renewable power this year, down from $311 billion last year. ""Clean energy investment has been relatively resilient in the downturn, but a flat trend of spending since 2015 is far from enough to bring a lasting reduction in emissions,"" the agency said. 
A buzzy fusion startup raises another $84 million 
Skeptics of fusion energy — the same reaction that powers the sun — like to joke that commercial fusion reactors have been 30 years away for the last 100 years or so.
One startup may be close to putting that joke to rest. MIT-spinout Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) just received another $84 million to build its tokamak reactor, which it says will be ready in prototype-form by 2025.
Singapore's Temasek Holding led the funding round and Norwegian oil giant Equinor also invested, among other firms.
Why fusion is important: It's a source of clean energy that can be turned on whenever we need it, unlike other forms of clean power like wind and solar.
Fusion comes with fewer downsides than nuclear fission — what most people mean when they refer to nuclear power. 
One big hurdle remains: Proving that it takes less energy to produce fusion than the reaction generates, or net energy gain.

Oil & Coal
Rystad Energy says its new forecast for global oil demand projects a decrease of 11.5%, or 11.4 million barrels per day, for the year. Demand for May alone is down almost twice that, meanwhile 2021 is looking like it will nearly match demand last year. 729,000 vehicles were sold in the US in April, the lowest total since early 2010, per the US Energy Information Administration.Coal companies are more likely to default on their debt as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new analysis by S&P.David Lawler, will take over from Susan Dio as chief of bp's US division, bp America. He was formerly the CEO of BPX energy, bp's US onshore oil and gas business. Chevron will cut 10% to 15% of its global workforce, Reuters reported. 
Clean energy
Investment in solar and wind projects by oil majors like Shell and bp is set to reach $17.5 billion over the next five years, according to Rystad. More than half of that will come from Norway's Equinor, which is investing heavily in offshore wind. I'm not really sure who's buying solar-powered yachts and sailing them to the Caribbean right now, but a company called Soel Yachts is selling them. And dang, they look cool! 
Electricity
Surging energy consumption by people working and living at home in the wake of the pandemic could threaten grid reliability as droves of people start turning on air-con, according to the firm Logical Buildings. 
That's it! Have a great weekend.

Oil companies including Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA are scrambling to cope with coronavirus outbreaks among their workers that could threaten the profitability of some of their largest projects.
Even as many parts of the world begin to emerge from Covid-19 lockdowns, work camps and oil platforms in remote locations, where employees live and work in close quarters, remain vulnerable to viral eruptions.
On Wednesday, Shell evacuated seven workers from an offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico for Covid-19 testing. Five of them have tested positive, a Shell spokeswoman said. The company has been testing workers before offshore postings since May 20, she said.
In recent weeks, hundreds of workers at remote oil and gas sites have been infected with Covid-19 including in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Mozambique, Canada and in Kazakhstan at one of the world's largest oil fields.
The outbreaks add to the challenges oil companies face as they try to recover from a devastating rout that saw crude prices more than halve in the wake of world-wide lockdowns that choked off demand.
Companies say the recent outbreaks have caused only limited interruptions. Still, they have had to bear additional costs related to staff safety and project delays, said Espen Erlingsen, head of upstream research at Norway-based consulting firm Rystad Energy.
""Future revenue will be affected by this as they're not able to execute planned activities,"" he said. ""The main concern is how it's influencing their cash flow.""
In Kazakhstan, more than 900 oil workers have been infected with coronavirus at the giant Tengiz oil field, according to state media reports. The field, which produces around 600,000 barrels a day, or 0.6% of global oil output, is operated by a consortium led by Chevron.
Workers were being tested when they left the field to return home and staff at the site have been reduced by two-thirds to around 10,000 workers over the last two months, said Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.
""Production continues uninterrupted and we remain focused on maintaining safe and reliable operations,"" a Chevron spokeswoman said.
Outbreaks at large oil projects could lead to production cuts, said Chris Midgley, head of analytics with S&P Global Platts. In Russia, oil company Rosneft and gas producer PAO Gazprom have reported outbreaks in Siberia, forcing them to quarantine workers and close airports.
""If this escalates, it's a big risk,"" said Mr. Midgley.
Some regulators have been concerned for some time about outbreaks at remote sites. The U.S. government discussed mandated shutdowns of oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico this spring but no action was taken.
In Africa, Total shut a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique on the Afungi Peninsula after workers tested positive for the virus in April. Only essential staff remain on site, a spokesman for Total said.
BP PLC said in April that it had delayed its liquefied-natural-gas plans -- including the expansion of its Tangguh project in Indonesia and the startup of its export facility offshore Mauritania and Senegal -- due to Covid-19, as reduced staff numbers on sites slowed progress.
Exxon-owned Imperial Oil Ltd. has been battling an outbreak at its Kearl Lake Canadian oil sands project in northern Alberta. Roughly 100 infections spread out over four Canadian provinces have been linked to the work camp by health authorities.
The virus spread at Kearl Lake despite measures the company has taken since March to limit outbreaks. Imperial has tried to distance workers by cutting the number of passengers on flights to the camp and shuttle buses to leave empty seats between them. The company also cut its staff at the site to 1,500 essential workers, down from roughly 4,000.
An Imperial Oil spokesman said almost all the infected people have recovered, and there are no active cases remaining at Kearl.
Work camp and offshore rig operators can limit viral spread if they are able to test all workers effectively and maintain proper social distancing and sanitation, said Conor Browne, a biosecurity consultant based in Belfast.
But the close working conditions can also cause disease to spread quickly if an infection invades. ""When the infection gets in, you've got a big problem,"" said Mr. Browne.
Norway's largest company, Equinor ASA, has cut personnel offshore to enable social distancing after a staff member working on the Martin Linge oil and gas field in the North Sea was airlifted to land with symptoms and tested positive in March.
For workers on platforms, day-to-day life changed immediately as offshore rotations extended to three weeks instead of two. Communal areas were deemed off-limits.
Workers were creative about how they coped with the change. With gyms closed, exercise bikes were moved onto helipads, which were also turned into a space for running and yoga classes. Fishing became even more popular and Saturday night bingo was transmitted via radio into everyone's cabins.
""A tape measure was probably one of the most important tools we had in the first days,"" said Jez Averty, an Equinor executive.

Norway's largest company, energy giant Equinor ASA—formerly known as Statoil—made efforts in April to keep its expansion of the Snorre project on the Norwegian continental shelf on track. Using the world's largest floating crane to move equipment onto the platform with specialist workers, crews kept their distance by building a tent to temporarily house the crane workers.
Equinor has also cut personnel offshore to enable social distancing after a staff member working on the Martin Linge oil and gas field in the North Sea was airlifted to land with symptoms and tested positive in March. The company decided to reduce the number of people working offshore, cutting offshore Norway personnel to 4,000 from 6,000 within a few days. It hasn't had any other offshore cases in Norway.

Prior to working at Equinor, Bergen-based Mikkelsen spent over 20 years at Norsk Hydro, which in 2007 merged with Equinor (known as Statoil at the time), where he managed petroleum technology for several fields at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and reservoir research teams, both with a special focus on improved oil recovery.Having previously held the post of IPIECA Vice-Chair for the last three years, Mikkelsen takes over the role of Chair from Shell’s Vice-President for Sustainability, Rupert Thomas, who steps down having completed his two two-year terms. Morten appointment was ratified during the association’s recent 2020 annual general meeting.Commenting on his new role, Mikkelsen said: “I feel privileged to have the opportunity to serve as Chair of this outstanding organisation. IPIECA’s work in the areas of environmental and social performance through its 45 years of history has always been important. However, I believe the role of IPIECA has never been more meaningful than now due to the challenges related to climate change and the role of oil and gas in the energy transition and the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.”IPIECA Executive Director Brian Sullivan said: “With decades of experience as a sustainability and oil and gas expert at Equinor, one of the world’s largest energy companies, Morten will provide valuable insights and direction across our climate, environment, social and oil spill workstreams, ensuring that cross cutting sustainability issues are at the core of each one.“I would also like to thank Morten’s predecessor, Shell’s VP for Sustainability Rupert Thomas for his four years of leadership which among other highlights saw us produce low-emissions pathways to support the Paris Agreement and work with the United Nations Develop Programme and the International Finance Corporation to release Mapping the oil and gas industry to the Sustainable Development Goals: An Atlas.”Founded in 1974 at the request of the United Nations Environment Programme, IPIECA is the only global association involving both the upstream and downstream oil and gas industry and remains the sector’s principal channel of communication with the United Nations.

In the
coronavirus pandemic
's financial fallout, Saudi Arabia's $300 billion sovereign-wealth fund has emerged as one of the world's biggest bargain hunters, taking minority stakes worth billions of dollars in American corporations.
The Public Investment Fund in the first quarter bought shares valued at about half a billion dollars each in Facebook Inc., Walt Disney Co., Marriott International Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., according to a U.S. regulatory filing late Friday.
The fund bought financial stocks, investing $522 million in Citigroup Inc. and $488 million in Bank of America Corp., while also spending $714 million on a stake in Boeing Co.
The purchases, reported in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, follow disclosures last month of stakes each valued at nearly $500 million in cruise operator Carnival Corp. and concert promoter Live Nation Entertainment Inc.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's day-to-day ruler, tasked the sovereign-wealth fund in 2015 with diversifying the country's economy away from oil by investing in companies and industries untethered to hydrocarbons.
PIF's recent buying spree highlights a bold strategy of piling into global stocks even as the novel coronavirus and a crash in oil prices mean that Saudi Arabia's financial position is now the most precarious in a decade. The Saudi government last week tripled its value-added tax rate and
cut subsidies to state employees
as it contends with lower oil revenue and an economy weakening under coronavirus lockdown.
While PIF has dipped into stocks in recent years, the fund has focused more on private equity, allocating capital to managers such as SoftBank Group Corp. Its record is mixed. PIF's $45 billion investment in the Vision Fund has suffered losses and its pre-listing investment in Uber Technologies Inc. of $3.5 billion is currently down 40%.
PIF's move into equities is particularly bold as few funds appear to be buying, according to Javier Capapé, director of sovereign wealth research at Spain's IE University. Sovereign-wealth funds used the financial crisis 10 years ago as an opportunity to snap up cheap stakes in many Western companies, but the wider impact of the current crisis means many nations with rainy-day funds aren't out buying, said Mr. Capapé.
""So far only PIF has made these big and bold movements,"" he added.
Many of the stocks that PIF has targeted are trading at historic lows, bruised by the fallout from the coronavirus and rock-bottom oil prices that have battered stocks of energy companies this year.
PIF's recent equity purchases in oil companies also have bucked Prince Mohammed's original mandate for the fund. It set out to invest in nonoil companies that can help establish new industries in technology, tourism and entertainment, or act as a hedge against the decline of oil, the kingdom's biggest asset.
However, The Wall Street Journal last month reported that the fund had
bought undisclosed stakes in a bevy of energy companies
, including Equinor ASA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and Eni SpA.
PIF invested $484 million in Shell, $222 million in Total and previously unreported stakes of $828 million in BP PLC, $481 million in Suncor Energy Inc. and $408 million in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., according to the U.S. filing.
""We actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country's economic growth,"" a PIF spokesperson said.
The Saudi fund invested in oil stocks during a period when Prince Mohammed attempted to assert control over the oil market. Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts in early March, so the prince flooded the market with cheap crude, creating a glut of supply as the pandemic lowered global demand.
The price of Brent, the global benchmark, fell by half to $25 a barrel in the middle of March, driving down share prices of major oil companies. Saudi Arabia subsequently attempted to revive the oil market by
agreeing to production curbs in a deal on April 12
.
According to the U.S. filing, PIF bought shares in oil companies during the first three months of the year, though it isn't clear whether the fund bought those stocks after the market sentiment had weakened. It purchased the stake in Norway's Equinor between March 30 and April 6.
Outside the oil industry, PIF bought stakes in the first three months of the year worth $496 million in Disney, $522 million in Facebook, $491 million in Cisco and $514 million in Marriott, the filing shows.
It also purchased shares valued at roughly $80 million each in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; chip makers Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.; International Business Machines Corp.; drugmaker Pfizer Inc.; Starbucks Corp.; railroad company Union Pacific Corp.; outsourcer Automatic Data Processing Inc.; and Booking Holdings Inc., the parent company of Booking.com.
The Saudi fund's public investments in the first quarter look well timed. It likely made the purchases ahead of the U.S. stock market's March 23 low, caused by growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. U.S. markets have rallied since. Disney and Facebook are up 13% and 26%, respectively, since March's end, and Marriott, which cut tens of thousands of jobs because of the pandemic, is up 6.6%. Facing a prolonged period of tepid global demand from airlines for its planes, Boeing is down 19% since the end of March.
PIF's spending comes months after Saudi Arabia
listed national oil company
Aramco, helping raise nearly $30 billion for the fund to deploy. But the kingdom's finances have deteriorated since then, and the government expects to draw down $32 billion from foreign reserves and borrow billions from capital markets this year. The fund is also facing a lower windfall from the sale of the kingdom's national petrochemical company to Aramco, a
transaction previously valued at $69 billion that the two sides are renegotiating to a lower price
.
On top of the stakes in public companies, PIF is also awaiting regulatory approval for a roughly £300 million ($363 million)
buyout of U.K. Premier League soccer team Newcastle United F.C.

However, The Wall Street Journal last month reported that the fund had
bought undisclosed stakes in a bevy of energy firms
, including Equinor AS, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and Eni SpA.
PIF invested $484 million in Shell, $222 million in Total and previously unreported stakes of $828 million in BP PLC, $481 million in Suncor Energy Inc. and $408 million in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., according to the U.S. filing.
""We actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country's economic growth,"" a PIF spokesperson said.
The Saudi fund invested in oil stocks during a period when Prince Mohammed attempted to assert control over the oil market. Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on production cuts in early March, so the prince flooded the market with cheap crude, creating a glut of supply as the pandemic lowered global demand.
The price of brent, the global benchmark, fell by half to $25 a barrel in the middle of March, driving down share prices of major oil companies. Saudi Arabia subsequently attempted to revive the oil market by agreeing to production curbs in a deal on April 12.
According to the U.S. filing, PIF bought shares in oil firms during the first three months of the year, though it isn't clear whether the fund bought those stocks after the market sentiment had weakened. It purchased the stake in Norway's Equinor between March 30 and April 6.
Outside the oil industry, PIF bought stakes in the first three months of the year worth $496 million in Disney, $522 million in Facebook, $491 million in Cisco and $514 million in Marriott, the filing shows.
It also purchased shares worth roughly $80 million each in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.; chip makers Broadcom Inc. and Qualcomm Inc.; International Business Machines Corp.; drugmaker Pfizer Inc.; Starbucks Corp.; railroad firm Union Pacific Corp.; outsourcer Automatic Data Processing Inc.; and Booking Holdings Inc., the parent company of Booking.com.
The Saudi fund's public investments in the first quarter look well timed. It likely made the purchases ahead of the U.S. stock market's March 23 low, caused by growing concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus. U.S. markets have rallied since. Disney and Facebook are up 13% and 26%, respectively, since March's end, and Marriott, which cut tens of thousands of jobs because of the pandemic, is up 6.6%. Facing a prolonged period of tepid global demand from airlines for its planes, Boeing is down 19% since the end of March.
PIF's spending comes months after Saudi Arabia
listed national oil company
Aramco, helping raise nearly $30 billion for the fund to deploy. But the kingdom's finances have deteriorated since then, and the government expects to draw down $32 billion from foreign reserves and borrow billions from capital markets this year.
On top of the stakes in public companies, PIF also is awaiting regulatory approval for a roughly £300 million ($380 million)
buyout of U.K. Premier League soccer team Newcastle United F.C.

| Jump to first hitCALGARY The world's largest sovereign wealth fund has divested from four Canadian oilsands companies over concerns about carbon emissions, adding to the woes of the already embattled domestic energy sector.
Shares in Suncor Energy Inc., Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Cenovus Energy Inc. all tumbled between 5 per cent and 7 per cent Wednesday after Norges Bank Investment Management, the country's US$1 trillion oil fund, said it would exclude those companies from its portfolio, citing their ""unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions.""
The fund reportedly held stock worth $1.15 billion in the Canadian companies at the end of 2019.
NBIM, which is a unit of the central bank, said it had taken a long time to sell shares of several of the blacklisted companies in a reasonable manner due to the ""market situation, including liquidity in individual shares.""
It always sells its holdings before any exclusions are announced, to avoid excessive market movements.
In addition to those four oilsands companies, the fund also dropped Swissbased Glencore Plc., U.K.-based Anglo American Plc, Germany's RWE AG, South African petrochemicals firm Sasol and Dutch company AGL Energy. Egypt's ElSewedy Electric Co., and Brazilian companies Vale SA and Electrobras were also excluded for causing environmental damage.
However, the Canadian oil industry believes the exclusion did not account for the industry's efforts to reduce emissions in recent years.
""Pulling investments from the oilsands and claiming its for climate change reasons is more about publicity than fact,"" Cenovus president and CEO Alex Pourbaix said in an emailed statement, adding that the company has cut its emissions intensity by 30 per cent in the past 15 years and plans to cut it by another 30 per cent over the next 10 years.
""Our company is committed to finding solutions to the global challenge of climate change while continuing to be a significant contributor to the Canadian economy through taxes, employment and buying goods and services from businesses across this country,"" Pourbaix said.
Oilsands companies have been under unrelenting pressure in recent years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve their environmental performance after a string of European banks such as BNP Paribas, ING and HSBC Plc have also pared back on lending to the industry.
A number of European oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc have reduced their investments in the oilsands to cut their carbon footprint and pivot toward less intensive forms of energy such as natural gas.
Now, the exit from the sector by the world's largest sovereign wealth fund with assets, built up through oil revenues from Norway's offshore oil reserves, further exacerbates that pressure.
Canada's federal government added to the industry's woes Wednesday, noting that fossil fuel companies must be more transparent in their approach.
""We've seen investors around the world looking at the risks associated with climate change as an integral part of investment decisions they make,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Wednesday, adding that many companies in the energy sector understood the investment climate is shifting.
""There is a need for clear leadership and clear targets to reach on fighting climate change to draw on global capital,"" he said.
On Monday, Ottawa rolled out a bridge financing plan for companies with at least $300 million in revenues, which is expected to aid aviation and energy sector.
Companies that ask for the help will also have to show how they are contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions over the coming years, tying the cash to the Liberals'promises on the environment.
That will include oil and gas companies that are also facing a hit from a global drop in oil prices.
Suncor, Canadian and Imperial did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.
NBIM is now the highest profile fund to exit the oilsands after a number of university endowment funds divested over the past few years. Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group joined a long list of European banks to signal they would reduce transactions in the industry on Wednesday.
Shares in all four companies fell sharply Wednesday morning, but analysts say their tumble was roughly on pace with the broader decline in oil and gas stocks.
""They're underperforming the market but they're not underperforming energy,"" Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick said, adding that ""energy is having a really bad day.""
Skolnick said most of the market expected the Norwegian fund to divest from Canadian Natural and Cenovus as it had already signalled it would move away from exploration and production companies in the oilsands, but he said there was a chance that Suncor and Imperial would be spared the exclusion because of their integration with refineries.
Norway's sovereign wealth fund was built up over decades using the proceeds of oil revenues and the country's state-controlled oil producer, Equinor SA, is planning to ramp up its drilling program this year. As a result, the decision is ""poorly informed and highly hypocritical,"" Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage said in an emailed statement Wednesday.
""As Norway, the 15th largest oil producer in the world, is set to drill more oil wells than ever before, one could only imagine Norges Bank's decision to be more focused on commercial competitiveness rather than environmental consideration as the world looks for reliable source of oil to fuel the coming decades,"" Savage said.
The Norwegian government owns 67 per cent of the shares in Equinor, which is also a joint-venture partner with Suncor in drilling projects in the North Sea and offshore Newfoundland and Labrador.
Equinor spokesperson Erik Haaland said in an email there is ""no connection between Norges Bank Investment Management and Equinor"" and the two operate independently.
""The decision does not impact Equinor's relationship with Suncor,"" Haaland said.
Earlier this month, Equinor, suspended its forecast but maintained its long-term forecast for average output growth of 3 per cent per year from 2019-2026.

| Jump to first hitTEESSIDE has missed out on being the location for a multi-million pound operations and maintenance base for the world’s biggest wind farm.
Instead 200 new jobs will be directly created at the Port of Tyne by firms Equinor and SSE Renewables, who are behind the Dogger Farm wind project in the North Sea which will eventually provide five per cent of the UK’s electricity needs.
Teesside Airport could still be used for a proposed heliport to service work on the wind farm, construction of which began in January, however it will not now be the headquarters for the base.
It was hoped manufacturing could have taken place on land now belonging to the South Tees Development Corporation (STDC) near Redcar – formerly used by the SSI steel plant – with work on a potential deal being undertaken by PD Ports with support from the Tees Valley Combined Authority.
Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said he still expected good jobs to flow from the Port of Tyne operation and go to people in Teesside, Hartlepool and Darlington.
There are also expected to be positive supply chain benefits across the North-East.
He added: “We are speaking to four major manufacturers about bringing offshore wind manufacturing to the Tees, and, with Net Zero Teesside, we will become the centre for UK clean growth with the world’s first full-scale carbon capture, utilisation and storage facility, creating 5,500 direct jobs.
“Because we have secured all of the former SSI land, following the deal we did with the Thai banks and winning the compulsory purchase proceedings, we can crack on and take this to a whole new level and attract investment and good quality local jobs.”
However, there was criticism at the outcome from Councillor Carl Quartermain, the leader of the Labour group on Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, who said Tyneside’s gain had been Teesside’s loss.
He said: “It raises questions over investment into the STDC site and why SSE and Equinor chose Tyneside over Teesside.”
Cllr Quartermain said that despite frequent promises of new jobs at the 4,500 acre site, none had yet been delivered.
Commenting on the new planned facility at the Port of Tyne, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said it was “fantastic news for Tyneside and the North-East of England”.
The UK Government has pledged to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 and is relying on major scale renewable energy projects like Dogger Bank to help achieve that aim.
Stephen Bull, senior vice president for Equinor North Sea New Energy Solutions, said: “The North-East has a strong industrial heritage and a supply area that stretches north and south of the River Tyne.
“With a strong low-carbon vision for the future, as well as targets to become net zero in its own operations by 2030, the Port of Tyne is clearly well set up to attract future investments which we hope will complement our activities.
“We are extremely proud that our skilled teams will operate the world’s largest offshore wind farm from here and look forward to becoming part of the community and strengthening our low-carbon commitment to the North East.”
Paul Cooley, SSE Renewables director of capital projects, said: “The announcement cements SSE Renewables’ and Equinor’s commitment to developing long term jobs and economic benefit in the UK and we are very pleased to welcome the Port of Tyne to the project.”
Matt Beeton, chief executive at the Port of Tyne said: “We’re absolutely delighted to have been selected by Equinor and SSE Renewables as the port of choice to house the operations and maintenance base for the largest offshore wind farm in the world.
“This is clearly a very important milestone in attracting such leading names in offshore power generation to the port, but it’s also extremely important for the wider region in terms of local supply chain and employment opportunities.”"

| Jump to first hitThe Norwegian oil and gas firm has shown impressive handling of infectious disease transmission cases and has shared deep company insights in disease management with the industryThe oil and gas industry is extremely wary of infectious disease transmission. The stakes are always high in the industry, which has for decades been managing outbreaks by having in place strong control measures whether onshore or offshore, writes Abdulaziz Khattak for OGN.It was no surprise then that the reaction to the Covid-19 situation was extremely prompt and the industry immediately began organising itself even before a health emergency was declared.All companies in the sector promptly activated crisis management and operators started sharing best practices amongst themselves.The IOGP-IPIECA Health Committee convened over the issue for the first time in January and started sharing experiences throughout the sector. This gave the sector a good start to respond to the crisis.Past events, such as the Ebola outbreak in 2014-15, had taught the sector how a health event if not promptly managed could become a crisis of a much bigger scale. The sector also learned that a key component of business continuity response was collaboration and partnership.      The Martin Linge installation A case study everyone in the industry can learn a lot from is Norwegian oil and gas company Equinor’s response to a Sapovirus outbreak in 2018 on one of its installations.In the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ (SPE) first Live Panel Session on ‘HSE and Covid-19’, Dr Fredrik Jervell, Leading Adviser Medical Services, Equinor, recounted the outbreak and laid out some important principles the company employed to control the situation besides having managed to keep all installations operational. Also cited was a solitary case of Covid-19 offshore.Jervell, who is a specialist in occupational medicine, has been leading the Covid-19 crisis management for Equinor. He is also on the joint health committee for the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP).Equinor has a 40-year experience in health and safety, and managing infectious diseases offshore is nothing new for it.Jervell said Covid-19 was novel, but not unknown to doctors, adding that the principles for its management were the same (as for other infectious diseases). These include:• Prevent the infection from coming offshore.• Contain it when it does.• Safely medevac the afflicted staff.Equinor has developed its own bowtie model, works hard on social distancing, does a lot of testing, and frequently quarantines and sanitises when there is a case.SAPOVIRUS OUTBREAK 2018      Figure 1 ... Equinor's bow tie model The incident happened on one of Equinor’s larger offshore installation during turnaround where 462 people were housed. The index event was a person vomiting in a common toilet on May 12 and then failing to self-quarantine. Four days later, on May 16, 15 people were found vomiting and having diarrhea in the cabins.It was quickly identified as an outbreak and containment measures were introduced. Everything was shut down, the cleaning frequency increased, and testing for the virus was started.Sapovirus is a relative of Norovirus and causes gastroenteritis mainly diarrhea. It’s important to know that the normal test procedure in Norway is only for Norovirus. So the diagnosis in this case was missed.The agent wasn’t identified (as a Sapovirus) until May 20 when there was a new resurgence of the outbreak and up to 17 cases were recorded in a single day.Jervell said that knowledge was very important since isolation for a Sapovirus patients is 48 hours instead of 24 hours as for a Norovirus. Additionally, the incubation and quarantine period for a Sapovirus is longer than Norovirus as well.""That knowledge was used to strengthen the quarantine and containment measures, and we managed to break the outbreak over the following week,"" he added.By June 8, the outbreak was over, and the containment measures were ended.In retrospect, Jervell said the main factor for the outbreak was underreporting of symptoms. ""The incident happened during turnaround when there are many contractors and subcontractors (offshore), who fear losing money if they don’t show up for work. So they simply didn’t report the symptoms and subsequently failed to self-isolate. That consequence of the incident was that it led to a delay of turnaround by three days and which made a considerable impact for Equinor,"" he explained.COVID-19 MANAGEMENT      Distancing is key to disease management at Equinor So far Equinor has reported one positive case (at the time of going to press) after testing 19 suspected cases on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.According to details, the infected Equinor employee on the Martin Linge installation had returned from Austria and travelled offshore on March 4. After developing symptoms, he reported to a medic on March 9. This was followed by his isolation in his cabin, and contact tracing was started. Some 35 close contacts were quarantined, including most of the management team on the installation. At the time, the platform was undergoing construction and the total number of persons on board was 776, including 2 floatels. This posed a big challenge.The individual was tested and his sample flown to an onshore hospital. It took two days to get the result, which was confirmed positive for SARS-CoV2. The patient and one more contact were medevaced onshore.The incident management team has already been mobilised and it was decided to demobilise non-essential staff, which numbered 650, by helicopter. The floatels were returned onshore as well.Further testing of six close contacts with symptoms were done, but all turned out negative.Remobilising of crew was initiated two weeks later after the entire installation was sanitised.Jervell said measures taken during Covid-19 are similar to those taken during the 2018 Sapovirus outbreak (or any infectious disease outbreak for that matter). These include isolation, quarantining close contacts, maintaining safe operations, demobilizing non-essentials, and regaining control to remobilise.An important basic rule is strict observance of distancing. As such gyms and common rooms are closed, meal times are staggered (no buffets served, workers work, eat and straightaway go to cabins, all meetings are by video/distance, and there is regular disinfection (several times a day).Manning is also reduced to operational levels and a lot of non-critical maintenance is delayed. Further precautions include reducing number of passengers per flight to 12 from the usual 18 so as to maintain distancing and reduce possibilities of transmission.People are very well aware that if they show symptoms, they need to self-isolate and call the medic and not show up for work.As per Equinor’s management, a Covid-19 case is put into three categories:• High probability: The case has a contact history and shows typical symptoms. He is isolated and tested, and all close contacts are quarantined.• Medium probability: The case has no contact history and shows less typical symptoms. He is isolated and tested. Close contacts are asked to self-monitor but allowed to work.• Low probability: The case has no contact history and shows atypical symptoms. The case is isolated until well (+1 day). Close contacts are not tested but are traced incase the situation develops.Equinor has also created its own bow tie model. As figure 1 shows, the likelihood-reducing measures are on the left-hand side, consequences-reducing measures on the right, and the index event is in the centre.The likelihood-reducing measures include first involving the local public medical infrastructure to reduce the likelihood or prevalence of the disease in the population; sick leave policy so that sick people don’t show up for work; travel restrictions to reduce likelihood of employees getting infected; employee awareness; and a travel/contact quarantine policy. Access control is the final barrier but it’s hard to screen for infection.The consequence-reducing measures are employed to prevent further cases. Here social distancing and sanitation measures are undertaken; and close contacts are identified and quarantined. To reduce disturbance of operations, employee confidence needs to be increased. People need to be and feel safe so as to focus on their safety critical work rather than the disease.Jervell said these measures are active on all Equinor installations and the results are that they haven’t had large disruptions of operations yet.© Copyright 2019 www.tradearabia.comCopyright 2020 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

Gordon Ballard, head of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, has seen many downturns in his 38-year career. But they were all followed by recoveries. This time, he fears, things may be different.
""In the past, activity decreased then picked up again — each time, we saw it come back,"" he said. ""Now it's not entirely clear if things just come back as normal. Everything has changed.""
The coronavirus pandemic has crunched oil demand so hard that US crude prices fell below zero this week for the first time in history. With the industry in crisis, Mr Ballard sees two immediate challenges: continuing to get workers to offshore sites to keep operations running, and ensuring companies have the financial resilience to survive.
Big Oil already faced an uphill struggle ahead of the crisis. European majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP had promised shareholders they could do it all — become more efficient, produce oil and gas at higher margins, pay down debt and ramp up dividends, all as they transitioned to being cleaner-energy businesses. But a darkening global economic outlook was making their pledges trickier to deliver.
Coronavirus has now forced them to make trade-offs unthinkable just two months ago as they slash capital spending and operational costs, suspend share buyback programmes, delay project approvals, issue debt and secure new credit lines. Most majors have pulled out the stops to preserve their dividends — but Norway's Equinor yesterday became the first to cut its payouts.
The situation is dire. The international oil marker, Brent crude, has plunged nearly 70 per cent since January. Shares in Shell, BP, France's Total, Italy's Eni and ExxonMobil of the US have fallen about 40 per cent, with Chevron down 30 per cent.
The majors have much less room to manoeuvre than during the 2014-16 oil crash. Tom Ellacott of WoodMackenzie sees that crisis as having shrunk a bloated industry, forcing companies to be more efficient. ""They have become a lot leaner, so this time the cost cuts can't go as deep as they did before,"" he said.
The energy consultancy estimates that the biggest US and European companies will burn through $175bn of cash if Brent averages $38 a barrel over the next two years, with the $52bn in costsaving measures announced so far falling short of the $78bn needed to maintain dividends and balance budgets. And with no sign of an end to the slump, asset sales to boost balance sheets will not be easy.
""Not only will buyers and sellers find it difficult to get alignment on price, the circumstances are so extreme that there won't be very many companies confident enough to buy assets right now,"" Mr Ellacott said.
The crash has been so severe that production is likely to fall across the world, particularly as storage tanks fill up. From US shale fields to Canadian oil sands and higher-cost Venezuelan barrels, projects are at risk.
""Companies are in extreme cash-conservation mode given the sheer uncertainty around the recovery. [They] are planning for the worst and stress-testing portfolios,"" said Mr Ellacott. ""The longer you see sustained low prices, the more pressure there is to start shutting in production.""
Unlike previous crashes, companies cannot rely on their refining businesses to offset a drop in exploration and production earnings. Lockdowns and travel bans mean there is limited demand for refined fuels such as petrol and diesel. The global downturn will also hit chemicals businesses, huge oil consumers. The majors will need to buy themselves time. Oil demand has fallen a third compared with pre-crisis levels of 100m barrels a day. Even if consumption recovers, mounting stockpiles will take time to shrink, keeping prices depressed. Companies that sell gas with oil-linked pricing will find little respite. One way to win in these market conditions is through trading divisions.
Yet how the majors cope will vary.
""Some already had stretched balanced sheets heading into this,"" said Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets. ""Downturns always expose weaknesses.""
Shell, BP and Equinor have the highest debt levels. Eni has a bigger exploration and production division as a proportion of its business, so is more tied to the oil price.

Gordon Ballard, head of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, has seen many downturns in his 38-year career. But they were all followed by recoveries. This time, he fears, things may be different.
""In the past, activity decreased then picked up again — each time, we saw it come back,"" he said. ""Now it's not entirely clear if things just come back as normal. Everything has changed.""
The coronavirus pandemic has crunched oil demand so hard that US crude prices fell below zero this week for the first time in history. With the industry in crisis, Mr Ballard sees two immediate challenges: continuing to get workers to offshore sites to keep operations running, and ensuring companies have the financial resilience to survive.
Big Oil already faced an uphill struggle ahead of the crisis. European majors such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP had promised shareholders they could do it all — become more efficient, produce oil and gas at higher margins, pay down debt and ramp up dividends, all as they transitioned to being cleaner-energy businesses. But a darkening global economic outlook was making their pledges trickier to deliver.
Coronavirus has now forced them to make trade-offs unthinkable just two months ago as they slash capital spending and operational costs, suspend share buyback programmes, delay project approvals, issue debt and secure new credit lines. Most majors have pulled out the stops to preserve their dividends — but Norway's Equinor yesterday became the first to cut its payouts.
The situation is dire. The international oil marker, Brent crude, has plunged nearly 70 per cent since January. Shares in Shell, BP, France's Total, Italy's Eni and ExxonMobil of the US have fallen about 40 per cent, with Chevron down 30 per cent.
The majors have much less room to manoeuvre than during the 2014-16 oil crash. Tom Ellacott of WoodMackenzie sees that crisis as having shrunk a bloated industry, forcing companies to be more efficient. ""They have become a lot leaner, so this time the cost cuts can't go as deep as they did before,"" he said.
The energy consultancy estimates that the biggest US and European companies will burn through $175bn of cash if Brent averages $38 a barrel over the next two years, with the $52bn in costsaving measures announced so far falling short of the $78bn needed to maintain dividends and balance budgets. And with no sign of an end to the slump, asset sales to boost balance sheets will not be easy.
""Not only will buyers and sellers find it difficult to get alignment on price, the circumstances are so extreme that there won't be very many companies confident enough to buy assets right now,"" Mr Ellacott said.
The crash has been so severe that production is likely to fall across the world, particularly as storage tanks fill up. From US shale fields to Canadian oil sands and higher-cost Venezuelan barrels, projects are at risk.
""Companies are in extreme cash-conservation mode given the sheer uncertainty around the recovery. [They] are planning for the worst and stress-testing portfolios,"" said Mr Ellacott. ""The longer you see sustained low prices, the more pressure there is to start shutting in production.""
Unlike previous crashes, companies cannot rely on their refining businesses to offset a drop in exploration and production earnings. Lockdowns and travel bans mean there is limited demand for refined fuels such as petrol and diesel. The global downturn will also hit chemicals businesses, huge oil consumers. The majors will need to buy themselves time. Oil demand has fallen a third compared with pre-crisis levels of 100m barrels a day. Even if consumption recovers, mounting stockpiles will take time to shrink, keeping prices depressed. Companies that sell gas with oil-linked pricing will find little respite. One way to win in these market conditions is through trading divisions.
Yet how the majors cope will vary.
""Some already had stretched balanced sheets heading into this,"" said Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets. ""Downturns always expose weaknesses.""
Shell, BP and Equinor have the highest debt levels. Eni has a bigger exploration and production division as a proportion of its business, so is more tied to the oil price. Exxon, meanwhile, has been in focus because of its large spending programme. Chevron has made a big bet on the US shale sector, which is experiencing a brutal downturn.

'Body blow' North Sea operators in cry for help For mature, higher-cost basins such as the UK North Sea, the oil plunge has sent tremors through a local industry that was yet to recover from the last downturn of 2014.
Deirdre Michie, head of OGUK, a trade body for the UK North Sea, described this week's ructions in the oil markets as a ""body blow"" to an industry already ""creaking"" under the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic.
North Sea operators have appealed to the British and Scottish governments for help to ensure the industry's workforce is not obliterated.
The immediate impact of the deep price falls will be on the North Sea's supply chain — drilling companies and services groups including Petrofac have already cut jobs or put staff on the government furlough scheme.
Redundant drilling rigs are stacking up in Scottish ports as oil producers cut spending and planned activities.
Many independents are still nursing heavy debts from the 2014 crash, although analysts say efforts to slash operating costs since the last crisis, decent cash buffers, oil price hedging strategies and capex reductions will give some breathing space in the short term while the industry prays for a rebound in prices.

Remember in math class when you reached imaginary numbers — the square root of negative 1?
That's what one analyst thought of when oil prices went negative on Monday: ""I feel as though I'm living that fear and dread once again. But they're not imaginary, however negative they may be,"" he said.
Why oil prices went negative, in 3 levels of detail
Level 1: The coronavirus pandemic has erased as much as 30% of global oil demand and producers have yet to cut even a fraction of supply.
The world is now awash with oil that nobody wants, causing storage to fill up.People who owned contracts for oil were paying buyers to take their oil, sending the price into negative double-digits on Monday. 
Level 2: Oil plunged into negative double-digits in part because of a market technicality.
Usually, when people refer to the price of oil they're talking about futures contracts — meaning, the price of oil that will be delivered at a later date.The price that went negative Monday was for futures contracts to be delivered in May. Those contracts expired on Tuesday. So on Monday, traders — who are not equipped to take physical deliveries — were rushing to sell them to buyers who have booked storage.But with storage at near full capacity and little demand, few buyers wanted those deliveries. Traders instead had to pay them to take the oil.
Level 3: The oil price that went negative for two days was West Texas intermediate, or WTI.
WTI is the benchmark for US crude oil, making it the most important futures contract to watch in the US. Globally, Brent crude is the benchmark, and while it's fallen by about 70% since the start of the year it's still far from negative. A big difference between the two benchmarks is proximity to markets. WTI oil is delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma — a city that is very much landlocked, unlike Brent. Storage in Cushing is expected to reach capacity by mid-June, according to UBS, and it's not as easy to send the oil elsewhere. That puts more downward pressure on the price. The winners and losers when oil goes negative 
From one perspective, no one wins. When the oil industry tanks, it drags down the rest of the economy. But some parties end up on top.
Winner — Companies who own storage or pipeline assets
Winner — Big oil traders who know how to play super contango
Loser — Many retail investors
Loser — Pretty much all oil and gas companies and the people they employ
Oil companies that operate in the US shale patch need prices close to $40 a barrel to eke a profit. Today's price of WTI is about half of that … so yeah, it's not great.Nearly every major player has announced spending cuts. Many have laid off large swaths of their workforce. And a handful has cut their dividends — the latest, Equinor, was the first oil major to do so.We're tracking those moves for 18 of the top companies here. So then, is it a bad time to start a degree in petroleum engineering? 
I was curious about this — given that petroleum engineering is the highest-paid college major.
On average, PE's earn almost six figures straight out of college (more than I make eight years out of college FWIW).
What professors told us: Basically, now could actually be a good time to get into the field.
""It's probably the best time in the last five years to get into the field,"" one said. ""When it looks the worst, go into PE. When it's at a peak, don't even think about it.""""Jobs are much like the stock market — the ideal is to buy low and sell high,"" another said. You can read all of their advice here. Pro tip: How to invest in oil 
Energy stocks are down. Obviously. And that means they're cheap. So should you buy them?
Idk. But if you want to, Morgan Stanley has some helpful guidance.
These are the bank's top stock picks for oil and gas, along with its reasoning.
No, cheap oil won't derail the transition to clean energy
Goldman Sachs interviewed more than 100 investors since the price of oil started to slip, and that was one of their top questions.
I mean: Look, what's happening in the markets isn't good for clean energy — wind and solar forecasts for the year have already been slashed.
But: Those headwinds aren't specific to clean energy. If anything, renewable energy is more secure.
Plus: The bank shared several signs that the transition will endure.
""The number of climate-related shareholder proposals has almost doubled since 2011 and the percentage of investors voting in favor has tripled over the same period,"" Goldman analysts said.Reserve-based lending for exploration and production companies is down 90% from the peak — and much of that money was redirected towards renewable energy projects.Oil majors like Shell and BP that are pledging to curb emissions will be less likely to accelerate oil field developments, they wrote. 
You can read Goldman's answers to the top 5 investor questions here.
Teaser: Top energy CEOs explain what coronavirus means for their industries 
Over the last two weeks, I've had the pleasure of connecting with top executives in the industry — from BP's Susan Dio to Sunrun's Lynn Jurich.
""Although we certainly did not envision the necessary widespread shelter-in-place orders that we're currently seeing across the country, I believe that Sunrun is a counter-cyclical business,"" Jurich said. ""In the solar industry we've always had to be scrappy — that was one of the main lessons from 2008.""
3 big energy stories we didn't cover
Leading solar company SunPower ""announced a pause on its global manufacturing and work cutbacks for all other employees, while further reducing executive salaries,"" Greentech Media reported. Equinor became the first oil major to cut its dividend — in this case, by two thirds, for the first quarter of 2020. Analysts have long projected that dividends of the world's majors would be at risk after the price of oil collapsed. Global carbon emissions are expected to fall by 5.5% this year, as the pandemic brings transportation and other industries to a halt, Axios reported. But to prevent temperatures from rising by more than 1.5°C over the coming decades — the target of the Paris Agreement — they'd need to fall by much more: about 7.6% annually.
That's it! Have a great weekend.

| Jump to first hitThere’s a certain devil-may-care glamour about going on a shopping spree when you’re already living beyond your means. It’s probably not the best way to convince your creditors to keep putting up the cash, however. Saudi Arabia might want to reflect on that after its recent splurge on oil companies, cruise ships and soccer. In the past month, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund has bought or been linked to plans to buy an 8.2 percent stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp.; about 80 percent of Newcastle United Football Club; and holdings in Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA and Equinor ASA. Alarmingly, the most sensible item on that shopping list may well be the 13th-placed team in the English Premier League. Carnival shares, for instance, are already down by about a third since the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) completed its acquisition of stock in the business last month.VulnerableA country as over-exposed to crude as Saudi Arabia shouldn’t be using its sovereign wealth fund to buy more oil, either. Equinor’s controlling shareholder, the state of Norway, last year instructed its pension fund to sell off investments in upstream oil and gas, so as to “make the government’s wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices”. Saudi Arabia is doing the opposite.Even the PIF’s more prudent attempts to diversify its exposures into businesses distant from oil demand haven’t panned out so well. A pre-listing investment of $3.5 billion in Uber Technologies Inc. is worth less than $2bn now. Its 38 percent stake in South Korea’s Posco Engineering & Construction Co. has lost more than two-thirds of its value since it was bought in 2015. And the kingdom managed to sell out of Tesla Inc. before its extraordinary rally at the start of the year.Incontinent spendingAs rich heirs have known since time immemorial, a string of failed business ventures doesn’t need to cramp your style as long as that endowment cash keeps flowing — but the problem for Saudi Arabia is that, as we’ve argued, those days are fast running out.As recently as 2014, years of outsize profits on crude had left the government sitting on net assets equivalent to 47 percent of gross domestic product. Since then, lower prices and incontinent spending have eroded Saudi Arabia’s nest egg with astonishing speed.Net debt will hit 19 percent of GDP this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, before rising to 27 percent next year, while coronavirus and oil-fight measures could push gross borrowing to 50 percent by 2022. That’s still modest by rich-country standards, but none is as leveraged as Saudi Arabia is to the price of a single commodity.Barring extraordinary cuts to its budget or a 2008-style oil price spike, the kingdom is likely to remain a net debtor for the foreseeable future. Dollar pegLenders already appear to be taking notice. Thanks to the general virus-inspired market panic and the specific effects of the current oil-price war, five-year credit default swaps insuring against non-payment of Saudi Arabia’s debt are currently running at about 179 basis points. That puts the country in the company of India, Indonesia, and Russia in terms of perceived credit risks, and far worse than the likes of Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Iceland.Its sovereign bonds still have a weighted average coupon of 3.43 percent and maturity in the latter half of 2030, so for the moment things seem comfortable enough. But lower-for-longer oil prices could cause that outlook to unwind remarkably quickly, especially if the kingdom’s fast-shrinking foreign reserves start putting pressure on the riyal’s dollar peg.Despite the PIF’s shopping spree, there are signs that Riyadh is aware of how constrained its circumstances are starting to become. Last week's announcement of a ceasefire in the bloody five-year war in Yemen is welcome for humanitarian reasons — but it’s also necessary on a more pragmatic level. Saudi Arabia’s military spending is the third-biggest globally after the US and China, and amounts to an extraordinary 8.8 percent of GDP — the highest share of any for which the World Bank has recent data.Splashy overseas acquisitionsThe ceasefire is being attributed to the impact of Covid-19, but it’s hard not to notice that military spending this year will fall to its lowest level in a decade. When the finances get tight, you just don’t have the money to spend on a quagmire that you once did.That willingness to make cuts is welcome — but once you add the amounts dedicated to domestic security, some 28 percent of Saudi Arabia’s budget is still going on such expenditures. It’s not surprising that a government lacking popular legitimacy in the middle of a strife-torn region should be spending a lot of money on self-preservation. Still, a country where 40 percent of the 33 million-strong population is under 25 might want to invest more on health, education and other longer-term goals.It’s probably that 1 trillion riyal ($271bn) government budget, rather than splashy overseas acquisitions, where the biggest savings need to be made right now. The message is the same, though: Riyadh needs to start cutting its coat according to its cloth, and fast.© 2020 ITP DIGITAL Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info)."

Saudi Arabia bought about $1 billion worth of shares in four European oil producers in recent weeks, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.
The world's largest oil exporter capitalized on the coronavirus-fueled market meltdown and the crash in oil prices to build stakes in Royal Dutch Shell, Equinor, Total, and Eni, The Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Saudi's $300 billion Public Investment Fund made the purchases, somewhat undermining its objective to diversify the kingdom's economy away from oil.
Its managers may be eager to tap into foreign income streams at bargain prices, especially as lower oil revenues and stimulus plans are set to widen the national budget deficit this year. The fund recently took an 8.2% stake in Carnival after coronavirus sunk the cruise giant's stock.
The novel coronavirus pandemic has disrupted global trade, forced factories to cut back or close, and led to widespread lockdowns intended to slow its spread, slashing demand for fuel. Saudi and Russia are also locked in an oil-price war after failing to agree on output cuts, meaning there's a supply glut.
Shares in Anglo-Dutch behemoth Shell, Norwegian oil giant Equinor, French producer Total, and Italian rival Eni have all slumped more than 30% since January. Equinor's stock was flat in early trading on Thursday, while the other three climbed about 1%.
Shell, Equinor, and Eni declined to comment to The Journal. Meanwhile, the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Total didn't respond to a request for a comment from the newspaper.

Saudi Arabia's sovereign-wealth fund has amassed stakes worth roughly $1 billion in four major European oil companies, according to people familiar with the matter, buying assets it perceives as undervalued in a market depressed by the pandemic and low oil prices.
The stakes in Equinor ASA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and Eni SpA were all bought by the Public Investment Fund on the open market in recent weeks, said the people, who added that the fund may continue to make stock purchases. ""The PIF is getting active again in the market . . I would not be surprised if we see similar deals again,"" said a Saudi official.
The investments mark a significant tactical shift for the roughly $300 billion Public Investment Fund, tasked by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with diversifying the country's economy away from oil.
The purchases also come at a precarious financial moment. Saudi Arabia's budget deficit is expected to widen this year as oil revenue falls and the kingdom increases spending to fund a stimulus package to combat economic damage caused by a countrywide coronavirus lockdown.
PIF bought a stake worth around $200 million in majority-state-owned Norwegian oil giant Equinor in the days around a sharp rally in oil prices last week. A Saudi-based nominee account with JPMorgan Chase & Co. accrued around 14.5 million shares -- or 0.43% of the total shares -- between March 30 and April 6, according to data from Oslo Market Solutions. The move made that account Equinor's 12th largest shareholder.
It couldn't be determined what size stakes PIF had bought in Royal Dutch Shell, Total and Eni, but people familiar with the investments said the combined stakes were worth about $1 billion. Representatives from Equinor, Royal Dutch Shell, Eni and J.P. Morgan declined to comment while the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Total didn't respond to a request for comment.
The purchases came during a tumultuous few weeks in the oil markets. Petroleum prices have fallen nearly 30% since early March, when Saudi Arabia mounted a price war with Russia, but staged rallies last week. Shell, Total and Eni have respectively shed 35%, 31% and 33% of their value in 2020, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, is down 52%.

He’s also a close adviser to the crown prince, who sets the kingdom’s oil production policy and influences prices globally.Equinor shares slumped just over 30 percent this year before rising 18 percent last week, amid a broad recovery for European energy majors, giving the company a current market value of about $44bn.The company has said it will cut capital expenditure by about 20 percent compared to earlier plans, in line with moves by rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. to counter a downturn in prices.© 2020 ITP DIGITAL Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

The purchases came during a tumultuous few weeks in the oil markets. Petroleum prices have fallen nearly 30% since early March, when Saudi Arabia mounted a price war with Russia, but staged historic rallies last week.
U.S. crude oil notched its largest-ever daily percentage gain last Thursday after President Trump and the Saudi regime expressed optimism about the possibility of a deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil-exporting nations to address a global oil glut.
The Saudi sovereign-wealth fund is controlled by Prince Mohammed and run by Yasir al-Rumayyan—who is also chairman of majority-state-owned Saudi Aramco. On Monday the fund disclosed an
8.2% stake in Carnival Corp.
, the world's largest cruise operator, whose shares have dropped more than 75% this year.
That investment came after high-profile deals in recent years, including a $3.5 billion stake in Uber Technologies Inc. and a $45 billion commitment to SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund.
Stocks in the travel and energy sectors have been among those hammered by government-imposed lockdowns and travel bans motivated by the coronavirus pandemic. Equinor shares pared some of their heavy losses so far this year last week, but remain down 23% for 2020. Shares closed 0.3% lower at 135.80 Norwegian kroner Wednesday.
Shell, Total and Eni have respectively shed 35%, 31% and 33% of their value in 2020, while Brent crude, the global benchmark, is down 52%.
OPEC and other oil-producing countries including Russia are due to convene a teleconference Thursday, before the Group of 20 nations host an energy ministers meeting Friday to debate the conclusions of the OPEC+ meeting.

The biggest oil companies have raised debt worth more than $32bn in recent weeks to build up war chests to manage the financial fallout of the coronavirus outbreak while preserving shareholder payouts.
Companies that have tapped the bond market since mid-March include ExxonMobil of the US, Royal Dutch Shell, the UK's BP, Norway's Equinor and France's Total, raising debt in euros and dollars. Oil and gas companies are pulling on every financial lever possible before having to cut their dividends. They are curbing capital spending by billions of dollars, suspending share buyback programmes, reducing costs and delaying the approval of projects.
Global oil demand has collapsed amid widespread lockdowns and travel bans. The drop in consumption has coincided with a Saudi Arabia-led price war that could see millions of barrels a day extra unleashed on to the oil market. The drop in Brent crude — the international oil benchmark fell last week to the lowest level since 2002 — has caused turmoil for energy companies whose share prices have also taken a hit.
Brendon Moran, a senior energy banker at Société Générale, said: ""The playbook is the same as previous crises: those that can get out into the bond market are doing it. It secures liquidity but it also demonstrates that they have access to funding."" Shell this week raised €3bn and $3.75bn, while BP tapped the market for €3.25bn and $3.25bn. Total and Equinor raised debt of €3bn and $5bn respectively. This followed a move by Exxon to raise $8.5bn a few weeks ago.
For some groups, such as Shell and BP, the bond issuance comes on top of securing multibillion-dollar credit facilities. While some smaller and independent companies have already cut their dividend as they come under financial pressure, major energy groups are treating this as a last resort. Many are aware that the payouts are one of the few reasons some investors hold the shares, as pressure builds on investors to move away from carbon-intensive industries.
Before the coronavirus outbreak, energy groups were already facing challenges. They had promised to keep shareholder distributions intact despite the macroeconomic uncertainty, maintain revenues from fossil fuel businesses and invest in lower carbon energy. Analysts have said that while existing payouts from energy majors were generally safe for now, the return of scrip dividends could happen, referring to the option for investors to receive additional shares instead of cash payments.

The U.S. quietly unsealed criminal cases against two former officials at Venezuela's state oil monopoly this month as part of what American officials say is a new round of charges and sanctions against a Maduro government they accuse of systemic corruption, narcotrafficking and stealing billions of dollars in state funds.
Prosecutors have also charged a businessman associated with the subsidiary of the company, Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PdVSA), for which the officials worked.
Some of the actions have been delayed in part by the coronavirus pandemic. But senior U.S. officials say they are part of a Trump administration effort to double down on its pressure campaign against President Nicolas Maduro's government after failing to deliver on its primary goal of ousting the regime.
Federal prosecutors in Miami, New York and Washington, D.C., are targeting what they allege is vast corruption in the country's beleaguered petroleum sector and currency markets, state-aided narcotrafficking, and money-laundering through Venezuela's military-run emergency food program.
They have charged dozens of defendants -- many of whom have pleaded guilty in U.S. courts -- and are continuing to probe alleged bribery and money laundering involving joint ventures with PdVSA, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.
On Friday, Miami prosecutors charged Leonardo Santilli, a Venezuelan citizen who controlled several companies working for the joint ventures, with money laundering in Miami and related offenses.
Mr. Santilli's companies allegedly received nearly $150 million from the PdVSA subsidiaries between 2014-2017, according to court documents. More than $100 million of that was allegedly transferred to accounts, trusts and shell companies controlled by him and other Venezuelan individuals, prosecutors allege.
Mr. Santilli allegedly used millions of the funds to bribe senior officials in the Venezuelan military and government on behalf of the joint ventures, according to the court documents, which also allege that employees at Mr. Santilli's companies tracked the payments in a spreadsheet, callingthe transactions ""comisiones,"" or commissions.
Mr. Santilli couldn't be reached to comment. Venezuelan officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
This month, federal judges in Miami also unsealed charges against two state-oil company executives at one the of subsidiaries Mr. Santilli allegedly received money from, Lennys Rangel and Edoardo Orsoni. Both worked at Petrocedeno, a joint venture between PdVSA and French oil giant Total SA and Norway's Equinor ASA. Representatives for Equinor and Total didn't respond to requests for comment.
An attorney for Ms. Rangel didn't respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Mr. Orsoni declined to comment.

""Chevron and our affiliates abide by a code of business ethics under which we comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and we expect our business partners to conduct business in compliance with these requirements as well,"" a Chevron spokesman said.
On Friday, Miami prosecutors charged Leonardo Santilli, a Venezuelan citizen who controlled several companies working for the joint ventures, with money laundering in Miami and related offenses.
Mr. Santilli's companies allegedly received nearly $150 million from the PdVSA subsidiaries between 2014-2017, according to court documents. More than $100 million of that was allegedly transferred to accounts, trusts and shell companies controlled by him and other Venezuelan individuals, prosecutors allege.
Mr. Santilli allegedly used millions of the funds to bribe senior officials in the Venezuelan military and government on behalf of the joint ventures, according to the court documents, which also allege that employees at Mr. Santilli's companies tracked the payments in a spreadsheet, calling the transactions ""comisiones,"" or commissions.
Mr. Santilli couldn't be reached for comment. Venezuelan officials didn't respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month, federal judges in Miami also unsealed charges against two state-oil company executives at one the subsidiaries Mr. Santilli allegedly received money from, Lennys Rangel and Edoardo Orsoni. Both worked at Petrocedeno, a joint venture between PdVSA and French oil giant Total SA and Norway's Equinor ASA. Representatives for Equinor and Total didn't respond to requests for comment.
Prosecutors alleged Ms. Rangel, the venture's former procurement officer, and Mr. Orsoni, former general counsel of both Petrocedeno and parent PdVSA, conspired to launder millions in bribe payments through the U.S., including by purchasing Miami condos. The bribes were allegedly paid to Ms. Rangel, Mr. Orsoni and other PdVSA executives to obtain lucrative contracts from Petrocedeno.
Both were charged in criminal informations, a method that often indicates a defendant is cooperating. The pair voluntarily turned themselves in and they were released on bail.
An attorney for Ms. Rangel didn't respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Mr. Orsoni declined to comment.
Collectively, the U.S. actions are meant, in part, to publicly shame the Maduro government as a strategy to undermine its political support, help empower the U.S.-backed opposition movement by recovering billions in stolen state assets, and disrupt the revenue that keeps the regime afloat and its allies financed, U.S. officials say.
Some former PdVSA executives estimate the governments of Mr. Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, pilfered hundreds of billions of dollars through the state oil monopoly over the last two decades by allegedly exaggerating production figures, inflating contract invoicing and using hand-selected contracting firms that bribed officials, U.S. prosecutors and current and former Venezuelan officials say.
""Maduro has turned the country into the biggest money laundering operation in the Western Hemisphere,"" said Carlos Paparoni, who heads the opposition movement's anti-money-laundering unit, in an interview.
U.S. officials were planning to announce new charges as soon as last week, but efforts to contain the coronavirus have disrupted the federal court system, according to people familiar with the matter. Officials were also concerned the announcement might be overshadowed by virus-related news, blunting efforts to ""name and shame"" Venezuelan officials.
The U.S. says virtually every major Venezuelan state institution has been used as a vehicle for laundering money stolen from the state, drug trafficking and other illicit operations. Those activities are so deeply rooted throughout the government, the U.S. says, that it has made Venezuela a major national security threat, including by aiding U.S. adversaries such as Iran, Hezbollah and Russia.
""Our sanctions are going to continue to ramp up,"" said David Peyman, head of the State Department's Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions division at a security seminar this month. Mr. Peyman said the U.S. is eyeing those who are helping the government in Caracas from outside Venezuela.
In another pending case, U.S. officials plan to allege Venezuela officials and their business associates planned to use oil contracting firms to embezzle $4.5 billion laundered mainly through accounts opened in Switzerland, Swiss court records show.
Investigators have also focused on Alejandro Betancourt, according to people familiar with the matter, a wealthy Venezuelan who hired President Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani and others to convince the Justice Department last year not to charge him. Mr. Giuliani couldn't be reached for comment. An attorney for Mr. Betancourt, Jon Sale, said: ""Mr. Betancourt is a legitimate businessman who has not violated any laws of the United States or elsewhere.""
In other cases, U.S. officials say prosecutors and law-enforcement agents are expanding a dragnet targeting the individuals and officials who allegedly used the country's emergency food program to divert hundreds of millions of dollars into overseas accounts even as poverty and mortality rates soared. CLAP, as the program is called, is the main food source for an estimated 15% of Venezuelans, but a critical supplement for a far larger percentage of the population.
The U.S. last year took coordinated action against the alleged CLAP scheme when it indicted Colombian businessman Alex Saab, who is being investigated separately for laundering money for Latin American drug cartels, according to U.S. and Latin American officials. The families of Mr. Saab and a close associate were central in running the CLAP money-laundering operations, according to foreign intelligence provided to the U.S. and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
An attorney for Mr. Saab didn't respond to requests for comment, though the businessman previously has rejected the corruption allegations as false.

2378183219,"Mar 18, 2020","Oil, Mining Companies Voice Opposition to Proposed Disclosure Rule; Some multinationals have joined anti-corruption advocates to call for regulatory alignment with regimes in Europe and Canada regarding disclosure of payments to foreign governments",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/oil-mining-companies-voice-opposition-proposed/docview/2378183219/se-2?accountid=7064,EQNR,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

A proposed rule mandating the disclosure of payments made by oil, gas and mining companies to foreign governments has become the target of anti-corruption advocates and even some businesses who say it fails to align with international standards.
The updated rule, proposed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December,
seeks to ease
the compliance burden the disclosure obligations placed on the extractive industry, according to the agency.
But some companies, in written comments to the SEC, have said the proposal will do the opposite.
The multinational companies, including the U.K.'s BP PLC, France's Total SA, Norway's state-controlled Equinor ASA and Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto PLC, have said they support disclosing payments on a contract-by-contract basis, as currently required in Canada and Europe, instead of aggregating them on a national level, as proposed by the SEC.
The deadline to submit public comments on the proposal was Monday. The SEC said it would not make a final decision on the proposal before April 24 to allow for additional comments due to disruptions posed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The proposed rule is the third attempt by the SEC to implement a controversial section of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring extractive-industry companies to disclose the payments they make to foreign governments. A first version of the rule was adopted by the SEC in 2012.
Other countries, including Canada, Norway and members of the European Union, have used the Dodd-Frank provision as a model for legislation mandating similar disclosures by extractive industry companies in their own countries.
After its adoption by the SEC in 2012, the rule became the object of lobbying campaigns and a legal challenge by the American Petroleum Institute. In 2013, a federal court in Washington, D.C.,
vacated
the SEC's rule, saying the agency went too far in interpreting the scope of the Dodd-Frank provision.
A second version of the rule
was rescinded
shortly after Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate in 2017. Republican lawmakers continued to cite the potential costs of complying with the rule, and argued that it could make companies less competitive—despite the disclosure obligations that had been enacted in Europe and Canada.
The proposed revisions have led to a divergence between the SEC's rule and the reporting requirements adopted abroad. That discrepancy could place additional burdens on companies that have to comply with multiple disclosure regimes, according to organizations that submitted comments to the SEC.
""While the proposed rules are based on an approach similar to the one taken by the EU, the currently proposed rules would nonetheless create substantial differences between the two regimes,"" Gine Wang-Reese, vice president of political and public affairs at Equinor, wrote to the SEC. ""[W]e question the need for such a two-tiered test and its additional compliance burden.""
Complying with the EU's contract-level requirement hasn't been too burdensome, according to Total. The chief executive of the company's Washington, D.C.-based lobbying arm, Francois Badoual, wrote to the SEC that the company's internal cost of reporting was about $200,000 per year. That cost covers about one month of work by employees at the central finance level and one to two days of data-verification work in each subsidiary.
Directors at anti-graft group Transparency International said in a letter that the proposed rule could spur other countries to eliminate their transparency laws. Similar groups also criticized the payment thresholds requiring disclosure, saying many important projects would fall through the cracks. The groups also objected to exemptions for smaller and emerging growth companies, and for situations in which a foreign law or a pre-existing contract prohibits disclosure.
Smaller companies are often more likely to pay governments large up-front bonuses to gain access to resources, the Carter Center, an organization founded by former President Jimmy Carter, said in a letter addressed to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton.

| Jump to first hitBy Prime Minister Erna Solberg (Oslo, 10 March 2020)Prime Minister Erna Solberg's speech at the opening of the Norwegian Offshore Energy Week.Ladies and gentlemen,Industry leaders and friends,It is a great pleasure for me to open the Norwegian Offshore Energy Week.Norway has the experience, expertise and business infrastructure to meet the challenges facing the energy industry.I hope that this event will provide an opportunity to consider possible ways of dealing with new challenges in markets throughout the world.We meet at a particular time, with the coronavirus influencing daily life, financial markets and supply chains in Norway and all over the world.We must all do our part to contain and limit the effects, but also stand ready to tackle the short and medium term consequences.The Government is monitoring the situation closely and engage where we can and should as the situation develops.Let us still use this event to focus on the long term perspectives for offshore energy.We know that the world's growing population will need more food, medicines, renewable energy, and minerals.If managed wisely, the oceans are key to meeting many of these needs.Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty and have attained a decent standard of living in recent decades.Affordable and clean energy is crucial for sustainable global development.However, far too many people throughout the world still do not have access to electricity.More energy is needed so that they can achieve a decent standard of living.There are, however, problems involved in ensuring energy for all.60 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are from energy use, and the level of emissions has never been higher.What we need, then, is both more energy and lower emissions.Changing the complicated global energy system is going to be incredibly difficult - but it is possible.Norway can be part of the solution.Our offshore energy sector is willing and able to play a role in the transition ahead.We have 50 years of experience in developing our petroleum resources offshore.During those 50 years, a vast, globally competitive supplier industry has developed in Norway that provides sophisticated technology and solutions.We believe this industry will continue to provide innovative solutions for our offshore industry, as well as in new markets and segments outside the petroleum industry.In fact, many of these companies have already begun to do so.Wind has powered ships at sea for centuries.Now modern technology is providing new opportunities for wind-based energy.For coastal states and island nations, the prospect of generating renewable energy from windmills offshore is attractive.Offshore wind can help secure some of the clean renewable energy we are going to need in the years ahead.The challenges to offshore wind solutions vary according to location.Bottom-fixed wind farms are already operating at scale off the coast of the UK.However, establishing them has required subsidies other countries may not be able to afford.In other places, water depths prohibit using bottom-fixed turbines.Turbines on giant floating installations may then be a feasible option. However, the costs are still too high for floating solutions to be competitive in any market.These are examples of some of the obstacles that I am sure you will be discussing over the next few days.I encourage you to tackle these challenges head-on. Because we know the world is going to need much more renewable energy in the future - and you can be part of the solution.Norway is well-placed to do its part.In 2019, the share of renewables in our total energy consumption was an impressive 72 per cent.This is mostly due to more than a hundred years of hydroelectric development, but hydropower has been supplemented recently by onshore wind.In Norway, we believe there will be greater reliance on electricity in the future - particularly when it comes to transport systems.My Government has promoted this transition by granting tax exemptions on electric vehicles and supporting the maritime industry in adopting electric vessels, while making sure that there are still plentiful supplies of renewable energy.I hope that Norway can lead the way in terms of electric mobility.I am often asked about the role oil and gas can play in an electric future.My answer is that even if we meet the targets set by the Paris Agreement, there is still going to be a significant demand for oil and gas - even though our drive for electrification will further lower the demand for fossil fuels.There will still be a need for petroleum, but at much lower levels than today. This view is supported by both the IPCC and the International Energy Agency.Many of our biggest oil fields are now in a mature phase, and resources are being depleted faster than we are able to find new ones.In a low-carbon future, I believe that lower emissions from the production of oil and gas will be important.I am encouraged by the ambitious targets set by the Norwegian oil and gas industry to cut emissions from production, and their aim to reach near-zero emissions by 2050.We know that our policies are producing good results.The carbon footprint of Norwegian production per barrel is about half the global average.Electrification also plays a key role in the strategy to cut emissions on the Norwegian continental shelf.Offshore wind can be an important source of renewable energy for the platforms and subsea installations in the North Sea.Testing out larger-scale floating wind installations, as Equinor's Hywind project is doing in the Tampen area, is an important first step.I am pleased that government funding through Enova is helping to make this project possible.The Hywind Tampen project is proving something important:It shows that we can use the expertise and technology of the oil and gas industry to develop new solutions for the future.These results and these new ambitions are the result of much hard work, technological development, bold leadership and large investments.We will need more of all these things in the time ahead.According to a report on offshore wind from the International Energy Agency, offshore wind could be a thousand billion dollar industry by 2040.Offshore wind is already Norway's largest renewable export industry - and it has the potential to become a new industrial success story.The Dogger Bank project, which provides electricity to 4.5 million households in the UK, is a good example.Equinor, one of the developers, and suppliers such as Aibel and Offshore Heavy Transport, have all won contracts in this project, in the face of tough competition.In September last year, I invited executives from industry, research institutions and key organisations to a roundtable discussion of offshore wind in Bergen.The discussion focused on industrial development, and highlighted Norwegian expertise as well as global market opportunities.In the autumn, the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy conducted a public consultation on the proposal to open two areas for offshore wind development.Among the roughly 300 respondents, many were concerned about the impact of offshore wind production on birdlife and fisheries.Others called for increased state funding in order to stimulate developments in offshore wind technology.Offshore wind development in Norway will not be without its challenges.On the one hand, there is no doubt that we have the competence and industrial expertise to be leaders.On the other hand, we have a substantial surplus of clean renewable energy already.High investment costs are certainly a barrier to offshore wind development.The difference in cost between onshore and offshore wind power is still considerable.Costs need to come down for offshore wind to be competitive, particularly in the Norwegian market. However, the pace of technology development may surprise us. As we have seen in solar and onshore wind, there has been a sharp decline in costs over the last few years.My Government is keen to see this industry develop and thrive as we seek to meet an increasing global demand for cost-effective and forward-looking solutions.From carbon capture and storage to offshore wind, the potential for future development in Norwegian waters is vast.We would never have been in this position without the knowledge and experience we have gained on the Norwegian continental shelf.Our history of activity on the shelf - and in the laboratories and workshops onshore - is also a history of cleaner and more efficient production.We recently marked the start of production from the Johan Sverdrup field.Thanks to renewable power from the mainland, the amount of CO2 emitted is only 700 grams per barrel.Which is particularly impressive when we know that the world average is 18 kilos.I would like to highlight some of the key Government policies supporting offshore energy.Firstly, we are committed to maintaining a stable and predictable framework for the petroleum industry.Secondly, we will continue to support research and development in order to increase productivity and recovery rates, and to reduce costs and emissions.The Norwegian Government has increased overall R&D spending for several years, and research in offshore wind alone has been allocated more than 500 million kroner over the past 10 years.Last month, our Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Tina Bru, received a report from Rystad Energy on the effectiveness of government-supported petroleum research programmes.The report concluded that these research programmes have led to increased value creation, cost reductions, new jobs - and innovative technologies to reduce the environmental and climate impact of these industries.Thirdly, we want to strengthen the international competitiveness of our energy industries.Institutions such as Innovation Norway, Export Credit Norway and the Norwegian Export Credit Guarantee Agency promote exports and global investments in energy, ranging from oil and gas to renewables.Norwegian Energy Partners, our hosts for this event, share the aim of strengthening the position and competitiveness of the energy industry internationally.They have brought us together to discuss future challenges and opportunities.NORWEP is our most important tool for bringing innovative and climate-friendly energy solutions developed in Norway to a growing global market.Today, more than two-thirds of Norway's export revenues come from ocean-based activities - fisheries, aquaculture, shipping and energy production.With our legacy, experience and forward-looking approach, offshore energy is at the heart of Norwegian industry and future value creation. I wish you a prospective and productive offshore energy week in Oslo.Thank you.Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitGreen groups and some politicians stepped up calls for oil drilling to be banned in the Great Australian Bight after Norway's Equinor abandoned its controversial and high-cost exploration venture far off the South Australian coast. The decision was seized on as a victory by environmental activists who opposed the drilling for years on safety and environmental reasons.
Equinor's manager in Australia, Jone Stangeland, said the group had decided that the project's potential was ""not commercially competitive"" compared with other opportunities.
Federal Resources Minister Keith Pitt said the decision was ""disappointing"" but noted Equinor wasn't pulling out of Australia altogether.
""Equinor has made it clear this was a commercial decision and the company will continue to be part of the Australian oil and gas industry,"" he said.
Tom Koutsantonis, state Labor's spokesman on energy who was state treasurer when BP dumped its Bight drilling plans in 2016, said the drilling approval process should have looked at whether there was a ""social licence"" for drilling before it was approved.
The chief executive of the South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy, Rebecca Knol, said the move was a ""lost economic opportunity for South Australia"". She was also critical of environmentalists and green groups for exaggerating the risks.
Equinor secured environmental approval to drill the Stromlo-1 well in December, triggering outrage from green groups and some traditional owners worried about the risks to water, tourism and other sectors in the event of an oil leak. Two earlier applications had been blocked as the regulator sought more information on how the risks would be handled.
Equinor's former partner in the drilling venture, BP, already walked away from the plan in 2016, while Chevron dropped permits in the region in 2017. Local junior explorer Karoon Gas has also quit licences in the Bight.
Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick said the fight must now turn to ensuring no other company stepped in to take Equinor's place and called for national heritage listing for the Bight.
The Australia Institute, the Wilderness Society and Greenpeace also called for a ban on drilling in the Bight.

Major oil companies are working hard to articulate a vision for their future, but the energy sector's poor performance shows that many investors aren't buying it.
Companies including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Total SA have launched plans to turn themselves into lower-carbon businesses.
But with low oil prices pressuring the industry's economics and many investors saying it is too early to know whether the intended transformations will generate significant returns, there is growing skepticism on Wall Street over the sector's future.
""Just saying that you're going to start a transition doesn't mean you're going to be successful at it,"" said Fabiana Fedeli, global head of fundamental equities at Netherlands-based Robeco Institutional Asset Management BV.
Major oil companies have limited room to maneuver after last year's lower oil and gas prices hit earnings -- and there is no relief in sight with oil prices down 16% since the start of the year after the coronavirus curbed demand. Energy companies are also under pressure from an expectation that U.S. shale's ability to quickly adjust supply will cap prices over the longer term.
The uncertainty has made investors skeptical about whether companies can boost profits and transform through new investments while paying out hefty dividends.
Energy has been the worst-performing sector of the S&P 500 for the past decade. ""Valuations are telling us that investors are losing confidence in the oil and gas sector,"" said Nick Stansbury, head of commodity research at asset manager Legal & General Investment Management.
In December, the initial public offering of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, mostly attracted domestic and regional investors. Many institutional investors outside the country passed on the world's largest listing, finding it too expensive, people involved in the IPO said.
In another blow to the sector, some investors say some companies' transformation plans don't go far enough. On Shell's latest earnings call last month, Chief Executive Ben Van Beurden made almost as many references to the energy transition and the company's small low-carbon businesses as he did to oil and gas.
But Sarasin & Partners LLP, a U.K. asset manager, sold around 20% of its stake in Shell last summer, expressing displeasure with the company's plan to increase fossil-fuel output over the next decade in an open letter to Shell's chairman.
""We were extremely disappointed that, despite your public commitment to act on climate change, [Shell] aims to deliver rising fossil fuel production to at least 2030. We do not view this as aligned with the Paris agreement,"" the letter said.
The company has invested $2.3 billion in what is known as new energies, including wind and solar power, since 2016. Over the same period, it spent about $35 billion on its traditional business of exploring for, and producing, oil and gas.
Shell's share price has fallen about 24% in the past year.
Another sign that oil stocks are falling out of favor: The dividend yields of companies including Shell, BP, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Norway's Equinor ASA have been rising. The higher yields are partly the result of falling stock prices. Some companies, including BP and Equinor, have raised their dividends in recent weeks.
While shareholders benefit from high dividends, the companies' ability to maintain or raise dividends is at risk if oil and gas prices remain low and keep earnings under pressure.
Exxon has increased its dividend annually for the past 37 years. Shell hasn't cut its dividend since World War II.
""Lowering the dividend is not a good lever to pull if you want to be a world-class investment case so [we're] not going to do that,"" said Shell's Mr. Van Beurden.
Last year, the weighting of oil-and-gas companies in factor-based indexes -- which enable investors to add exposure to particular attributes of a stock, such as growth and value -- fell in every category, including yield, value and profitability, according to data from global index provider FTSE Russell.
Shrinking company valuations also meant the proportion of energy stocks in the S&P 500 fell to 4% in January, its lowest in at least three decades.
A study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that investors view undeveloped crude reserves as a reason to discount a company because of the risk that climate policies will curb future oil demand and leave some resources permanently underground and worthless.
""I definitely think there will be some resources left in the ground from a carbon-footprint perspective,"" Eldar Saetre, CEO of Equinor, said recently.

WDuring his tenure, Dudley managed to plot a course between 2010's Deepwater Horizon disaster and the middecade collapse of the oil market, while maintaining BP's position as the third-biggest dividend payer on the FTSE 100.
These challenges, however, pale in comparison with those faced by his successor Bernard Looney, who will this afternoon lay out his vision for the future of the oil giant.
First among these is the question of how BP will respond to ever-growing pressure regarding BP's role in the transition to a green economy.
Looney is widely expected to announce plans to clean up the firm's emissions, but the real proof of the company's ambitions will be in the way the firm decides to use the proceeds from its $15bn (£11.6bn) disposal programme, which is central to reducing the firm's $45bn debt pile.
According to Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, Looney has two options.
First, he could follow the example of fellow oil major Shell, and commit everything to oil and gas production in an attempt to wring every drop from an industry that many believe is in terminal decline.
Alternatively, he could put everything into BP's less profitable renewables assets, which would win the firm plenty of admirers but present a challenge to cash flow.
""There's no easy answer"", says Hyett, but growing investor pressure will have Looney nervous about the potential backlash to his decision.
Mark van Baal leads Follow This, an investor group dedicated to making oil majors commit to aligning with the Paris accords. Last week Norwegian state giant Equinor said it would take responsibility for its ""scope three"" emissions —those produced by consumers using its products — as well as halve the carbon intensity of its emissions by 2050 after pressure from the group.
Van Baal is confident that Looney will make a similar pledge, but vows to ""maintain the pressure"" on the company, which in 2018 spent $500m on renewables projects, just three per cent of its total capital expenditure.
""Firms such as Equinor and Shell have vowed to halve their footprint by 2050, but it's not enough. While these companies continue to expand, it's just a smokescreen"", he says.
Others are more direct. A source in the oil and gas industry said that carbon intensity targets such as that announced by Equinor are little more than ""window dressing"".
As if this wasn't enough, Looney must also contend with an oil market as depressed as it has been since 2015, with growing supply surplus weighing on prices, which fell $7 per barrel year on year to $64 per barrel in 2019, knocking BP's profit 20 per cent.
As he bowed out, Dudley said that he was confident that BP would successfully navigate the rapidly changing energy landscape. He may yet be right, but it's clear that for now there are some rough waters ahead."

Norwegian oil and gas group Equinor has pledged to halve the carbon intensity of the energy it produces by 2050, the latest push to cut emissions in a sector under increasing pressure to take action on climate change.
The target, which includes emissions from both production and customer consumption, will be achieved by becoming a ""major"" player in offshore wind and by restricting oil production to the least carbon intensive fields.
The company said it aimed to reduce emissions released during production to net zero by 2030, through better operational efficiency, converting natural gas to hydrogen with carbon capture, or carbon offset mechanisms such as planting trees.
""Today we are setting new short, mid and long-term ambitions to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and to shape our portfolio in line with the Paris Agreement,"" said chief executive Eldar Saetre.
The move by the state-backed oil company illustrates Norway's difficult path in attempting to become one of Europe's greenest nations while still relying on the oil and gas that transformed it into a wealthy country. ""Equinor was built on the Norwegian continental shelf. This is our heritage and also a very important part of our future,"" Mr Saetre said before presenting the goal.
Energy companies have come under fire from activists and investors for not taking responsibility for their role in enabling climate change.
Even as the majors take initial steps to account for their emissions, they face criticism for focusing on carbon intensity rather than absolute levels of emissions, which allows continued growth of their fossil fuel businesses.
Rivals' pledges have varied in their ambition. Royal Dutch Shell wants to reduce carbon intensity by 2-3 per cent by 2021, while France's Total aims to cut it by 15 per cent by 2030.
Equinor plans to increase its renewable energy capacity to 4-6 gigawatts by 2026, 10 times its current level, and 12-16GW by 2035.

| Jump to first hitNORWAY's Equinor unveiled a raft of climate commitments yesterday after beating analyst expectations. in the final quarter.
Profit before tax at the stateowned firm fell to $3.5bn (£2.7bn), down from $4.4bn for the same period last year, but ahead of forecasts of $3.3bn.
The firm's suite of new measures to tackle its fossil fuel footprint includes a commitment to reduce carbon intensity from all emissions connected to the company by 50 per cent by 2050.
This means that by that date each unit of energy produced will, on average, have less than half of the emissions compared to today.
The ambition even includes scope three emissions, those created by customers in Equinor's value chain. According to the company, these account for 85 per cent of all emissions.
The move is a considerable volteface for chief executive Eldar Saetre, who last year said ""scope three is not my responsibility"".
The firm also said that by 2030 all of its operations around the world would be carbon neutral.
Equinor, which used to be called Statoil, will also grow its renewable capacity to four to six gigawatts by 2026, roughly 10 times what it is today, with aims to expand to 12 to 16 gigawatts by 2035.
Saetre said: ""We will continue addressing our own emissions in line with the emitter pays [rule]. We can and will do much more."""

| Jump to first hitDAVOS, SWITZERLAND The bosses of some of the world's biggest oil companies discussed adopting much more ambitious carbon targets at a closed-door meeting in Davos, a sign of how much pressure they're under from activists and investors to address climate change.
The meeting, part of a World Economic Forum dominated by climate issues, included a debate on widening the industry's target to include reductions in emissions from the fuels they sell, not just the greenhouse gases produced by their own operations, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The talks between the chief executives of companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Chevron Corp., Total SA, Saudi Aramco, Equinor ASA and BP Plc showed general agreement on the need to move toward this broader definition, known as Scope 3, the people said, asking not to be named because the session was closed to the press. The executives didn't take any final decisions.
Shell and Aramco declined to comment. Media representatives for Chevron, Total and BP weren't immediately able to respond to requests for comment. Equinor confirmed its CEO Eldar Saetre attended the meeting.
Targeting Scope 3 emissions would be a big shift for an industry that produces the bulk of the world's planet-warming emissions, once that could eventually require them to sell far less oil and gas. The simple fact that the industry's top executives were considering it underscored how climate concerns suddenly came into focus in Davos this year.
For the first time, environmental risks occupied the WEF's top five longterm concerns. Business leaders from BlackRock Inc.
CEO Larry Fink to Allianz SE boss Oliver Baete used their platform at the event to focus on sustainable investment. The two highest-profile attendees at the forum - President Donald Trump and climate activist Greta Thunberg - made headlines as they staked out opposing positions on the issue.
The oil and gas executives debated a document produced by the WEF on ""neutralizing emissions at the pump,"" a reference to the gasoline and diesel sold to customers. There's an urgent need to shift the industry's target from production to emissions from end users, said one person.
Several companies have already set targets for Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, which come directly from pumping and refining hydrocarbons. Yet these account for less than 10 per cent of total emissions from the life cycle of oil and gas. Some of their pledges have also focused on curbing emissions intensity - the amount of carbon dioxide released per unit of energy - which wouldn't necessarily lead to a reduction in the volume of greenhouse gases produced if a company's output is growing.
Among major energy groups, only Shell, Total and Madrid-based Repsol SA have publicly announced that they are either targeting or monitoring Scope 3 emissions.
The Spanish company made the boldest move, promising net-zero emissions in 2050 by diverting investment into wind and solar power. Shell has taken more modest steps, pledging to offset the greenhouse gases produced by fuel sold to drivers on their loyalty-card programs in the U.K. and Netherlands.
Eni SpA Chairman Emma Marcegaglia said in a Bloomberg TV interview that the company is committed to becoming carbon neutral on a Scope 1 and 2 basis by 2030. The Italian oil and gas giant is in discussions about Scope 3 emissions, but needs more guidance from the government on how to do so, she said.
Other companies, notably U.S. majors Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron have so far resisted specific pledges to cut total emissions, with the latter focusing instead on the carbon intensity of the energy it produces. BP CEO Bob Dudley, who retires later this year, has agreed aims for Scope 1 and 2 gases but in the past opposed a Scope 3 target.
""We need to reduce our carbon intensity, everyone in the industry agrees on that,"" Dudley said in an interview in Davos. However, he cautioned that shareholders and companies were using multiple definitions of Scope 3 emissions. ""We need to get a common definition"" so the industry ""can work together in a powerful way.""

| Jump to first hitDoing nothing on carbon emissions and focusing only on near-term returns is ""not an option"" for oil and gas producers, the head of the International Energy Agency has declared, because the industry's social licence and long-term profitability are at stake.
IEA chief Faith Birol urged oil and gas producers to spell out how they will tap their engineering capabilities and financial resources to accelerate the world's transition to clean energy.
That means not just reducing direct emissions from oil and gas extraction but stepping up investments in renewables, storage, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and advanced biofuels.
""The scale of the climate challenge requires a broad coalition encompassing governments, investors, companies and everyone else who is genuinely committed to reducing emissions,"" Dr Birol said. ""That effort requires the oil and gas industry to be firmly and fully on board.""
The stark advice from the Paris-based IEA came as it emerged that controversial drilling plans by Norway's oil company Equinor in the Great Australian Bight off South Australia face a legal challenge in the Federal Court.
The Wilderness Society's SA arm has kicked off a court process arguing that the environmental approval granted last month by the national offshore petroleum industry regulator (NOPSEMA) for the deepwater well was legally faulty because it relied on Equinor's ""substandard"" consultation process.
""It is patently clear that Equinor has refused to undertake best practice consultation, and it is our view that it didn't even meet the basic regulatory requirements,"" said Wilderness Society SA director Peter Owen. ""Our view is that NOPSEMA made an important legal error in accepting Equinor's substandard consultation.""
Equinor said it wasn't appropriate to comment on a legal matter before the courts. The company, formerly Statoil, has continued to invest in oil and gas exploration alongside voicing support for the Paris climate targets. Earlier this month, it committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions from its operated fields in Norway by 40 per cent by 2030 - involving a NOK50 billion ($8.1 billion) investment - and to near zero by 2050.
Dr Birol said cutting greenhouse gas emissions released when oil and gas is extracted from the earth - something that accounts for about 15 per cent of energy-related emissions - was an immediate task of all in the industry.
""A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily,"" he said.
But he pointed to ample other opportunities to lower the emissions intensity of petroleum production by eliminating routine flaring and integrating renewable energy and low-carbon electricity into new projects.
In a report presented to the Davos conference on Tuesday, the IEA found that average investment by oil and gas companies in non-core areas reaches just 1 per cent of total capital spending, with most going on solar PV and wind.
""Overall, there are few signs of the large-scale change in capital allocation needed to put the world on a more sustainable path,"" the IEA said, while noting that investment in new oil and gas projects was still needed even in a rapid transition to clean energy.
Responding to the findings, Santos chief executive Kevin Gallagher said the oil and gas producer had been investing ""quite heavily"" in the past few years in the solar-powered electrification of production equipment in the Cooper Basin and Queensland to both reduce emissions and free up gas for sale, and in waste recovery projects.
But he said the most significant potential lay in carbon sequestration in the basin, which Santos calculates could store 20 million tonnes a year of carbon for 50 years. That's about 1 per cent of the 2 billion tonnes a year of carbon capture and storage the IEA estimates the world will need by 2040 even to meet a two-degree warming limit, he said.
Mr Gallagher reiterated a call for CCS to be eligible to generate carbon credits as a way of making it viable.
""Australia has a position to really punch above its weight here with the depleted reservoirs and fields across the country,"" he said. ""What we have found is that both sides of politics understand the value of CCS, and what we need now is that to translate into the methodologies of the regulations or legislation that allows it to qualify for credits.""

The budget proposal for 2020 includes continuation of the work with a full scale CO2 capture, transport and storage project, funds for operation of the Technology Centre at Mongstad (TCM) and for the research program Climit.- CO2 capture and storage will be one of several necessary tools to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement. The government will continue to develop technology for CO2 capture, transport and storage and we have spent large funds on the development and planning of full scale projects. We propose to continue this effort in 2020, says Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Kjell-Børge Freiberg.The effort to develop a full scale project for capture and storage of CO2 will continue. The government proposes to allocate 215 million NOK to the industry actor's work with the project in 2020. This will facilitate the continuation of the project maturation.The Government will consider realisation of the project once the front end engineering and design studies and the external quality assurance process has been completed. When assessing an investment decision, the government will evaluate the results from the front end engineering and design studies, the potential for benefit realization and the economic leeway.The case will be presented to the Parliament. The government has stated that an investment decision can be made in 2020/2021. Both the government and the industry emphasize the importance of spending sufficient time planning the project. Sufficient planning is also advised by the external quality assurance.- The Government has an ambition is to realise a cost effective solution for CCS in Norway, provided this results in technology development internationally. The proposed state budget facilitates the necessary progress towards an investment decisions, says minister Freiberg.The state will decide whether to continue the operation of TCM when a new participation agreement draft is available. The state wish for increased participation and financial support from the industry. There are ongoing negotiations between Gassnova and the industrial owners of TCM to land a new agreement for continued operation of TCM after the current participation agreement will expire in August 2020.The government will continue to support research, development and demonstration of CCS technology through the CLIMIT program and the research centre for CCS at SINTEF in Trondheim.Background:While treating the RNB 2018 the parliament decided to give its consent to the government's recommendation on continuing the planning of the full scale project until an investment decision in 2020/2021. The capture projects are taking place at Norcem and Fortum Oslo Varme (FOV), and Equinor cooperates with Shell and Total on the project for the transport and storage solution.The estimated capital cost for full scale CCS facilities and operational costs for five years is 11,2 billon NOK (Norcem) and 11,8 billion NOK (FOV).The broad international set of actors involved in the Norwegian CCS project provide a good basis for international technology development and knowledge dissemination. The actors include Finnish Fortum, German Heidelberg, French Total and British/Dutch Shell, along with large Norwegian actors with international presence, like Equinor and Aker Solutions.The current development schedule for the full scale project indicates an investment decision in 2020 aligned with the state budget for 2021. That is a very tight schedule. According to the external quality assessment a project schedule aiming for an investment decision in 2020 seems to be thoroughly planned, however there is significant schedule risk. Nevertheless, the external quality assessor is of the opinion that the plan is executable and points out that it is an advantage that all actors are aware of the risk and that risk-reducing measures are being implemented. The government is therefore still aiming for an investment decision in 2020/2021.Source: Government of Norway"

Equinor has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions from Norwegian oil and gas fields by 40 per cent in the next decade.
The oil and gas major said it would cut its emissions from production in Norway by 70 per cent by 2040 and to near zero by 2050, equivalent to about 13m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
But the Norwegian state-controlled group set no target for reducing emissions from the use or burning of its oil and gas, which in 2018 amounted to the equivalent of 314m tonnes of CO2, leading to complaints of ""greenwashing"".
""We know we will need oil and gas for some time, but less so than we produce today ... it's a question of which oil and gas. It's about increasing competitiveness,"" said Eldar Saetre, chief executive. The targets were disclosed a day before Equinor opens the biggest new oilfield in the North Sea in decades. The Johan Sverdrup field will be unveiled by Erna Solberg, prime minister, in a sign of its importance to Norway, which could earn about $100bn in tax revenues from it over the next five decades. Emissions from the field's production are about 700g of CO2 per barrel compared with a global average of 18kg, said Equinor. It will use power from the mainland, in Norway's case mostly hydroelectric, rather than from gasfired turbines on the platform.
Mr Saetre said that by using mostly electrification and investing NKr50bn ($6bn) over the next decade, Equinor could cut about 5m tonnes from its production emissions. The investments would be profitable, he said, reducing carbon taxes and offsets it had to buy.
Equinor and Oslo argue that only the lowest-emitting producers should continue as demand for oil falls.

Equinor has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions from Norwegian oil and gas fields by 40 per cent in the next decade.
The oil and gas major said it would cut its emissions from production in Norway by 70 per cent by 2040 and to near zero by 2050, equivalent to about 13m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.
But the Norwegian state-controlled group set no target for reducing emissions from the use or burning of its oil and gas, which in 2018 amounted to the equivalent of 314m tonnes of CO2, leading to complaints of ""greenwashing"".
""We know we will need oil and gas for some time, but less so than we produce today ... it's a question of which oil and gas. It's about increasing competitiveness,"" said Eldar Saetre, chief executive. The targets were disclosed a day before Equinor opens the biggest new oilfield in the North Sea in decades. The Johan Sverdrup field will be unveiled by Erna Solberg, prime minister, in a sign of its importance to Norway, which could earn about $100bn in tax revenues from it over the next five decades. Emissions from the field's production are about 700g of CO2 per barrel compared with a global average of 18kg, said Equinor. It will use power from the mainland, in Norway's case mostly hydroelectric, rather than from gasfired turbines on the platform.
Mr Saetre said that by using mostly electrification and investing NKr50bn ($6bn) over the next decade, Equinor could cut about 5m tonnes from its production emissions. The investments would be profitable, he said, reducing carbon taxes and offsets it had to buy.
Equinor and Oslo argue that only the lowest-emitting producers should continue as demand for oil falls. Equinor predicts that Norway's oil and gas production will be less than half its current levels by 2050. ""I would prefer Johan Sverdrup oil and gas rather than from other fields,"" said Mr Saetre.

| Jump to first hitNORWAY's state-owned oil company Equinor has announced plans to slash fossil fuel emissions by 40 per cent by 2030, with aims to get close to net zero by 2050.
To achieve its 2030 target the firm will have to make annual cuts of more than 5m tonnes of emissions, roughly 10 per cent of the country's total.
In order to do so, Equinor plans to invest around $5.7bn (£4.3bn), which will be used to replace gas turbines with renewable energy and major installations, including offshore wind turbines and hydroelectric power.
Eldar Saetre, Equinor's chief executive, said: ""Equinor supports the Paris agreement and a net zero target for society... We are now launching an unprecedented set of ambitions for forceful industrial action and substantial absolute emission reductions in Norway, aiming towards net zero in 2050.""
Norway is heavily dependent on oil and gas, which account for roughly half of its export revenue. It has used the proceeds from these sales to build the world's largest sovereign wealth fund."

Norway's state-backed energy group Equinor plans to take a stake in the Bill Gates-backed start-up Kobold Metals, in an effort to gain expertise in using artificial intelligence and machine learning to hunt for oil and gas.
Equinor will invest tens of millions of dollars in the San Francisco-based company and have a stake just below 10 per cent, according to people familiar with the deal.
Founded in 2018, Kobold aims to create a ""Google Maps"" of the Earth's crust. It is backed by the Silicon Valley venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz and Mr Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund.
Kobold is focused on finding new deposits of cobalt, a metal used in electric car batteries.
It collects and analyses multiple streams of data — from old drilling results to satellite imagery — to better understand where new deposits might be found.
Equinor is not interested in cobalt but in the use of AI and machine learning on large data sets, which may be helpful for finding new sources of oil and gas.
""Data science and analytics applied to big subsurface data will be increasingly important for low carbon and low cost oil and gas discoveries,"" Lisa Rebora, senior vice-president of exploration at Equinor, said. ""Partnerships with companies like Kobold Metals will provide us with valuable insights and application of new techniques to the overall exploration process.""
Equinor, previously known as Statoil, has one of the largest exploration budgets in the industry. The Norwegian government has pushed for more oil and gas exploration, and issued a record number of licences last year.
Connie Chan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, said large resource companies could struggle to hire top computer science talent.
""The brightest minds right now in computer science are not working to solve the world's most pressing problems,"" she said. ""What I think is Kobold's huge advantage is talent management: brilliant computer scientists who don't have a chemistry or geology background.""
Kobold's database is analysed by algorithms that determine geological patterns that indicate a potential deposit of cobalt, which occurs naturally alongside nickel and copper, said Kurt House, the company's chief executive.
The technology also helps predict the type of data that needs to be collected in order to find a new deposit, he said.
At present, more than 60 per cent of cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, much of it by hand, and often by children and young men.
Little historical exploration has been conducted for cobalt because of the small size of the market. That is likely to change with the rise of electric cars, which could create a shortage of cobalt by the end of the decade, Mr House said.'Data science and analytics applied to big subsurface data will be increasingly important'

In the middle of the North Sea, four metal platforms perched on yellow supports and weighing 100,000 tonnes sit above more than $100bn of black gold.
The Johan Sverdrup field, located in Norwegian waters not far from the border with the UK, does not officially open until next week, but has already polarised opinion. For proponents, it marks nothing less than the revival of Norway's oil industry; for critics, it is an environmental tragedy that shows just how hard climate change will be to stop.
""Johan Sverdrup very much represents the future of Norwegian oil,"" said an enthused Arne Sigve Nylund, head of development and production in Norway for Equinor, the state-controlled oil major that is the field operator.
Situated in one of the first licences handed out on the Norwegian continental shelf more than half a century ago, Johan Sverdrup holds about 2.7bn barrels of oil and, only a few weeks after its unofficial start-up, is already the largest producing field in western Europe.
But perhaps its biggest selling point for both Equinor and the Norwegian government is that it is powered by electricity from shore, rather than the usual gas turbines, making it a flagship for their argument that if the world still needs oil for decades, it would be best to have it from sources that have the lowest carbon emissions.
""It's an incredibly important project for Norway. We are, on average, best at getting oil out with the lowest emissions,"" said Kjell-Borge Freiberg, Norway's oil minister. He added that carbon dioxide emissions per barrel from Johan Sverdrup were just 700g versus a global average of 18kg.
As one of the largest finds anywhere in recent years, the fortunes of the Johan Sverdrup field are being closely watched by other oil groups. But there are still big questions about western Europe's biggest oil industry, not least due to environmental pressure.
""Johan Sverdrup is a field that should never have been planned or opened. It is yet another field that prolongs the problem,"" said Silje Lundberg, head of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature.
Could Johan Sverdrup be the last big North Sea oilfield to be developed? Few expected such a discovery in 2010 when Lundin Petroleum, the Swedish independent oil group, struck oil in the North Sea. But it soon became apparent it was a giant field, one that promises to earn about NKr900bn ($102bn) for the Norwegian state over its 50-year lifetime.
In a sign of its importance to Norway — where oil production has fallen since the turn of the century — the official opening on January 7 will be attended by both the king and prime minister.
The field will produce about 450,000 barrels per day of oil from next summer and at its peak, after a second phase of development, should reach 660,000. The project has a break-even cost of under $20 per barrel after a mini-crisis in the oil industry in 2015 allowed Equinor to push through big cost reductions.
Opinion is split on the likelihood of further big finds in the North Sea, given just how much exploration has been done in both Norway and the UK over the last five decades.
Rune Nedregaard, head of the Johan Sverdrup project and an Equinor executive, said: ""To be sure, we are talking about smaller and smaller finds. If you had asked me prior to finding Johan Sverdrup, I would have said there was no chance [of a big discovery].""
Mr Nylund is more reserved, saying merely ""we must be humble and hope"". He argued that such fields would be part of the energy future even as the world moves towards more renewable power.
""We have fields here that will produce for at least 50 years into the future. When you look into the energy forecasts, there will still be a need for oil in 2050. We have a part to play, to be part of the solution with low-carbon oil production,"" he added.
Norway's government is going full steam ahead, even as oil production figures are close to three-decade lows (much of the country's recent production has been gas). It handed out a record number of exploration licences earlier this year and has hopes not just in the North Sea but also inside the Arctic Circle with the Barents Sea. More than half of Norway's oil reserves remain in the ground, according to the country's petroleum directorate. ""If we explore, we will find,"" said Mr Freiberg.
Jamie Thompson, a research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, argued that Norway had returned to levels of exploration seen before the 2015 downturn, bucking the global trend. Thanks to generous tax rebates for exploration and an increasing number of Norway-focused companies such as Equinor, Lundin and Aker BP, he refused to call it the last big discovery.
""If Norwegian companies continue to explore and take risks, there's nothing to say they can't find more. To write off Norway in that regard would be to write off Sverdrup itself,"" he said. He pointed to the Glengorm discovery on the UK side of the North Sea earlier this year — the largest find there for a decade, albeit with one-tenth of the reserves of Johan Sverdrup.
The big unknown is how efforts to limit global warming under the Paris agreement to 1.5-2 degrees will affect both the supply and demand for oil.
Equinor remains optimistic that its oil and gas will be competitive for decades to come, and is also ploughing money into offshore wind.
But Ms Lundberg, who claims electrifying Johan Sverdrup is mere ""greenwashing"" as most of the emissions come when the oil is burnt not produced, argued that oil must be left in the ground to reach the Paris targets.
Mr Nylund, overlooking the grey waters of the North Sea in the fading December daylight, unsurprisingly does not agree but is also not as gung-ho as oil executives once were in an industry where projects such as Johan Sverdrup are meant to last half a century or more.
""We don't think it's a good idea to close down production of hydrocarbons prematurely. We still have a part to play. But it's pretty hard to predict 30 years into the future.""'It's an incredibly important project for Norway' Kjell-Borge Freiberg, oil minister

Norway's government is going full steam ahead, even as oil production figures are close to three-decade lows (much of the country's recent production has been gas). It handed out a record number of exploration licences earlier this year and has hopes not just in the North Sea but also inside the Arctic Circle with the Barents Sea. More than half of Norway's oil reserves remain in the ground, according to the country's petroleum directorate. ""If we explore, we will find,"" said Mr Freiberg.
Jamie Thompson, a research analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, argued that Norway had returned to levels of exploration seen before the 2015 downturn, bucking the global trend. Thanks to generous tax rebates for exploration and an increasing number of Norway-focused companies such as Equinor, Lundin and Aker BP, he refused to call it the last big discovery.
""If Norwegian companies continue to explore and take risks, there's nothing to say they can't find more. To write off Norway in that regard would be to write off Sverdrup itself,"" he said. He pointed to the Glengorm discovery on the UK side of the North Sea earlier this year — the largest find there for a decade, albeit with one-tenth of the reserves of Johan Sverdrup.
The big unknown is how efforts to limit global warming under the Paris agreement to 1.5-2 degrees will affect both the supply and demand for oil. Equinor remains optimistic that its oil and gas will be competitive for decades to come, and is also ploughing money into offshore wind.
But Ms Lundberg, who claims electrifying Johan Sverdrup is mere ""greenwashing"" as most of the emissions come when the oil is burnt not produced, argued that oil must be left in the ground to reach the Paris targets.

In the middle of the North Sea, four metal platforms perched on yellow supports and weighing 100,000 tonnes sit above more than $100bn of black gold.
The Johan Sverdrup field, located in Norwegian waters not far from the border with the UK, does not officially open until next week, but has already polarised opinion. For proponents, it marks nothing less than the revival of Norway's oil industry; for critics, it is an environmental tragedy that shows just how hard climate change will be to stop.
""Johan Sverdrup very much represents the future of Norwegian oil,"" said an enthused Arne Sigve Nylund, head of development and production in Norway for Equinor, the state-controlled oil major that is the field operator.
Situated in one of the first licences handed out on the Norwegian continental shelf more than half a century ago, Johan Sverdrup holds about 2.7bn barrels of oil and, only a few weeks after its unofficial start-up, is already the largest producing field in western Europe.
But perhaps its biggest selling point for both Equinor and the Norwegian government is that it is powered by electricity from shore, rather than the usual gas turbines, making it a flagship for their argument that if the world still needs oil for decades, it would be best to have it from sources that have the lowest carbon emissions.
""It's an incredibly important project for Norway. We are, on average, best at getting oil out with the lowest emissions,"" said Kjell-Borge Freiberg, Norway's oil minister. He added that carbon dioxide emissions per barrel from Johan Sverdrup were just 700g versus a global average of 18kg.
As one of the largest finds anywhere in recent years, the fortunes of the Johan Sverdrup field are being closely watched by other oil groups. But there are still big questions about western Europe's biggest oil industry, not least due to environmental pressure.
""Johan Sverdrup is a field that should never have been planned or opened. It is yet another field that prolongs the problem,"" said Silje Lundberg, head of the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature.
Could Johan Sverdrup be the last big North Sea oilfield to be developed? Few expected such a discovery in 2010 when Lundin Petroleum, the Swedish independent oil group, struck oil in the North Sea. But it soon became apparent it was a giant field, one that promises to earn about NKr900bn ($102bn) for the Norwegian state over its 50-year lifetime.
In a sign of its importance to Norway — where oil production has fallen since the turn of the century — the official opening on January 7 will be attended by both the king and prime minister.
The field will produce about 450,000 barrels per day of oil from next summer and at its peak, after a second phase of development, should reach 660,000. The project has a break-even cost of under $20 per barrel after a mini-crisis in the oil industry in 2015 allowed Equinor to push through big cost reductions.
Opinion is split on the likelihood of further big finds in the North Sea, given just how much exploration has been done in both Norway and the UK over the last five decades.
Rune Nedregaard, head of the Johan Sverdrup project and an Equinor executive, said: ""To be sure, we are talking about smaller and smaller finds. If you had asked me prior to finding Johan Sverdrup, I would have said there was no chance [of a big discovery].""
Mr Nylund is more reserved, saying merely ""we must be humble and hope"". He argued that such fields would be part of the energy future even as the world moves towards more renewable power.

| Jump to first hitThe giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield is coming to the rescue of Norway's oil industry - again.
The improbable mega-project in the North Sea, years after the oil province's heyday, already provided a lifeline to engineers and platform builders starved for work during a historic slump in the crude market. That was evident during a recent visit to the project as some of the more than 500 workers on the facility zip by on the scooters used to cut travel time between the four connected platforms.
Now that it's started producing, Equinor ASA's flagship project is showing what it can do. The field is redressing production figures for the Nordic country and the state-controlled company in a year that's been worse than expected, and will help them both increase output in the years ahead. It also temporarily masks the decline of older fields and a dwindling pipeline of Norwegian projects.
Sverdrup's earlier-than-expected start in October broke a long trend of underperformance for Norway's overall oil production. Output lagged forecasts in 28-straight months through September, even after the industry regulator slashed its 2019 prognosis to a 31-year low.
While the field is unlikely to compensate fully for unplanned outages earlier this year, it ramped up output quicker than planned to as much as 350,000 barrels a day recently, Arne Sigve Nylund, Equinor's executive vice-president for development and production in Norway said on Tuesday. Loading programs suggest production will be close to 400,000 barrels by January, not far from its firstphase maximum rate of 440,000 barrels a day expected by the summer.
""The project is running well,"" Nylund said aboard the massive facility on a windy day in the North Sea. The screen-filled control room is connected by fibre optics to subsea sensors almost two kilometres below and workers carry digital tablets to access the data they need from anywhere on the 700-metre-long installation.
Sverdrup has allowed Equinor to maintain a target for stable production in 2019 despite a three-per-cent drop in the first nine months of the year, driven mostly by its Norwegian fields. It's also given a huge boost to smaller owners Lundin Petroleum AB and Aker BP ASA.
In the coming years, Sverdrup will drive output growth both for Equinor and Norway as a whole. National oil and gas production is expected to reach a peak in 2023, near the 2004 record, and Sverdrup will account for a third of Norway's crude output at that time.
The dismal performance of Norway's oil production before Sverdrup has mainly been due to unplanned outages, which have compounded significant planned maintenance programs. The biggest impact came from Equinor's Snorre field, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. One of the platforms on the field was shut from early March to the middle of August after a riser broke off and fell to the sea.
That and other outages have raised concerns that too much maintenance was delayed during the crisis years from 2015 to 2017, when a collapse in oil prices led to huge efficiency gains but also pushed operators to keep installations running to maintain cash flow. Equinor's Nylund rejected the notion that unplanned events in 2019 were due to a lack of maintenance. The Snorre incident was due to corrosion caused by a design fault that the company had actually monitored, he said.
Yet oil companies slashed the number of man-hours related to operations and maintenance on production facilities by 30 per cent in 2015 and then a further 12 per cent by 2017, according to figures from the Petroleum Safety Authority. The level in 2018 was close to 2015, and it's an open question in the industry whether that is sustainable, said analyst Simon Sjothun of Rystad Energy AS. ""The jury is still out,"" he said.
While a PSA spokesman said there's no general concern about a maintenance backlog, some equity analysts have raised the issue of performance from Equinor's more mature fields. ""We still see weaker performance from legacy fields,"" DNB ASA's Jon Masdal said in a note on Nov. 22.
The issue will become even more dire after Sverdrup's production has peaked. Equinor has pledged to drill as many as 3,000 wells in the next two decades, but it has few big projects lined up after 2022, and certainly none the size of Sverdrup.

| Jump to first hitChevron and BP pledged to invest a total of $116.5 million in oil and gas exploration over the next three years to preserve their reputation and remain in good standing with the government after abandoning drilling commitments in the Great Australian Bight.
The news, announced by federal Resources Minister Matthew Canavan, came as Norway's Equinor, BP's former partner in the Bight drilling, controversially secured environmental approval from the national offshore oil and gas regulator for its Stromlo-1 exploration well there.
BP and Chevron walked away from their drilling programs in the Bight, a remote offshore area that could hold significant undiscovered oil resources, in 2016 and 2017, respectively.
Then South Australian treasurer Tom Koutsantonis said at the time that BP had done ""tremendous damage"" to its international reputation by pulling out. But the UK firm declared it was determined to remain in good standing with governments, which it could do by carrying out exploration in other areas instead.
Under the deal announced by Senator Canavan and South Australian Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellekaan on Thursday, almost $60 million of the total to be invested by the two energy majors will be in South Australia.
Mr van Holst Pellekaan said that was ""excellent news"" for the resources sector. ""This investment will help tap the immense promise of South Australia's resources sector, driving job creation, investment and royalties,"" he said.
""Australia's offshore oil and gas policy ensures that companies who commit to a program of exploration deliver on their investment commitments.""
BP agreed to invest $40.6 million by October 2022, while Chevron will invest $75.9 million by September 2022.
Chevron wouldn't say where it plans to explore, noting only its commitment ""to working closely with key stakeholders on partnerships that deliver long-term benefits and continue to contribute to Australia's economic future"".
Meanwhile, the storm of protest from environmental groups that met the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority's acceptance of Equinor's environment plan for its well spread on Thursday into the political arena.
The approval comes with strict conditions.
Centre Alliance's federal member for Mayo, Rebekha Sharkie, claimed that most South Australians would be disappointed by the decision, pointing to the opposition to the drilling in the bulk of the 30,000 submissions made to NOPSEMA during the regulatory approvals process.
Ms Sharkie said the risks of any spill were too high, particularly given the depth of drilling and the remoteness of the location.
Equinor still needs to secure approvals for its well operations plan and a safety case for the drilling rig before it can proceed with any work.
Centre Alliance environmental spokesman Senator Rex Patrick said the need for further approvals still left scope ""to ensure the voices of Australians opposed to this project are heard and acted upon"".
The well is due to be drilled by April 2021 at a cost around $100 million.

| Jump to first hitA 12-YEAR-OLD with a passion for medicine has been to London to pitch his idea for a drone carrying vital equipment as a way of getting help to patients more quickly.
Morgan McNally, whose love of TV programmes like 24 Hours in A&E has inspired him to want to become a paramedic or doctor, came up with the idea for a competition aimed at getting young people to think of things that could make the world a better place.
* Students have a go at operating, as seen on Dragon's Den
The 12-year-old, who is from Sherburn Village, near Durham, was one of 10 finalists, shortlisted from almost 3,000 entrants across the country.
The Belmont Community School pupil went to London on Saturday to pitch his idea for an adapted drone, which could be used to carry vital medical equipment like defibrillators or medicines to get to patients more quickly in congested areas.
He said: “I love watching TV shows in the control room and you can see how the ambulance service can struggle with response times.
“That’s how I came up with the idea for a drone which could carry a defibrillator and medical supplies to get first aid to people across a busy city like London.
“It’s not that hard to make so I think it could be doable.”
Morgan goes to his school’s Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) club and found out about the competition through his teacher.
After reaching the final, he went to the Science Museum in London to pitch his idea to judges of the Young Imagineers competition, organised by energy company Equinor.
Vicki McNally, his mum, who went with him, said: “It was just amazing. The whole experience of going down was brilliant and they made us feel really welcome.
“We're so proud of him. He really believes in his idea and he is really passionate about becoming a paramedic or being in the industry when he's older. He loves finding out about medicine and medical equipment.""
Sophie Banham, who is a wind farmer developer at Equinor and was one of the judges, said: “Young Imagineers is all about celebrating the UK’s most creative young minds in STEM and what we saw on the day from all of our 10 finalists, blew all the judges away.
The winning idea was for a micro robotic ""spider"" which would be programmed to surgically repair and cure parts of the brain to prevent brain damage after trauma."

| Jump to first hitNewfoundland and Labrador is expecting a wave of oil and gas exploration in the province's offshore waters over the next few years. The deepwater hunt will involve oil and gas companies spending up to $4 billion to identify the province's next major oil project.
""There's an unprecedented level of interest for offshore East Coast Canada,"" said Jim Keating, executive vice-president of offshore development at Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, which holds minority equity stakes in three of the province's offshore oil projects, and is responsible for driving further investments in the sector.
""From 2014 to present, we've amassed over $4 billion worth of offshore work commitments, which is about 60 per cent of the total ever in offshore Newfoundland and Labrador in its history. And that goes back to the mid-'80s,"" Keating added, in an interview. ""That's pretty significant.""
Keating says the exploration interest is, in part, due to new geoscience work and changes to how bidding rounds are conducted. ""That has really made it a must-be place for some of the world's best explorers,"" he said.
The province has four producing oil projects: Hebron, Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose. Exxon Mobil Corp., Husky Energy Inc., and Suncor Inc. are the primary operators on those projects, with Chevron Corp. and Equinor ASA (formerly Statoil ASA) also involved.
Husky's approved West White Rose project is now under construction and expected to produce first oil by 2022. That would mark the province's fifth producing project. A sixth production site could materialize if Equinor develops its Bay du Nord project in the Flemish Pass area, roughly 500 kilometres east of St. John's.
The province's four existing offshore projects have produced 19.9 billion barrels of oil since production started at Hibernia in 1997. Current production at the four projects averaged 257,000 barrels per day this year, down from 2007's peak monthly production of 426,680 barrels per day.
The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers forecasts Atlantic Canada's production, led by Newfoundland, to peak at about 354,000 bpd by 2026, before falling to 185,000 bpd by 2030.
Keating predicts the potential Bay du Nord project - and perhaps even just-increased production at Hebron - to push production to new peaks. ""So our peak day is yet to come even with the projects that we know about, let alone the ones that we have yet to discover,"" he said.
""It's not inconceivable to me that with modern technology and modern capabilities, that there are not another four projects out there just waiting to be discovered. In actual fact, I think it's almost a geologic certainty that there's going to be other major projects discovered. I guess the question is when and where.""
New entrants - including China's CNOOC (formerly Nexen), BP PLC, HP Group Ltd. out of Australia, and Houston-based Navitas Petroleum - have joined the five existing oil and gas players in holding exploration licences, according to Nalcor.
The areas under, or slated for, exploration are all further offshore than the province's active projects, meaning drilling will take place in much deeper water.
Exxon is currently drilling in the Flemish Pass, the first exploration associated with the new licensing setup. The other eight licence-holders are expected to start their new hunts as early as next year, as well as through 2021 and 2022, notes Paul Barnes of CAPP, which counts as members all the companies involved with production and exploration in Newfoundland and Labrador.
The companies involved in exploration have proposed 10 drilling projects over the next two to four years, with upward of 100 wells.
""That's a fair amount of exploration activity and the reason we're really excited is that there's hope there will be some more discoveries,"" Barnes said in an interview. ""Because beyond what's really discovered to date, there is no next large discovery that will go into production.""
Globally, offshore oil production accounts for 27 million barrels per day and is expected to peak by around 2020, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., an investment research firm.
""The non OPEC pre-FID (final investment decision) pipeline is dominated by Brazil, Guyana, and Mexico ... there is an incredibly long tail of small projects which means lots of project FIDs competing for uncertain demand,"" wrote Bob Brackett, an analyst at Bernstein, in a note to clients.
Future growth of the relatively more expensive offshore developments depends on whether U.S. shale resources slow down and whether the oilsands can see continued growth.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC's decision in October to pull out of expensive offshore projects in Kazakhstan's part of the Caspian Sea underscores the economic uncertainty of underwater reserves around the world, and casts doubt over major oil companies'appetite for offshore projects at a time when oil prices are expected to remain subdued for the foreseeable future.
But Barnes disputed the suggestion that the current round of exploration represents the province's last opportunity to benefit financially from its oil holdings. ""I don't really get a sense of that. I think most people in our industry - and government as well - still view this as a long-term endeavour.""
Also clouding the industry's rosy outlook are concerns from the province's fishing industry, and the threat of more oil spills off the province, where four spills have occurred since 2018, including 250,000 litres released at Husky Energy's White Rose field in November 2018. The largest spill in the province's history led to the shutdown of the SeaRose floating production storage offloading vessel.
Nalcor says independent research assessments have identified potential for 52.2 billion barrels of oil and 199 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, all within areas that make up just nine per cent of the province's offshore area, which totals 1.8 million square kilometres.
""That's what's giving them (the oil and gas companies) the ability to seek the level of commitment funding that today amounts to $4 billion,"" Keating said. ""So it's a pretty good story. And it's a story where every year a new chapter is written.""
The industry's obvious optimism appears justified but the potential payoff is far off, says Patrick Brannon, the director of major projects at the Atlantic Provinces Economic Council, a Halifax-based think tank.
""The industry has gone through a bit of a downturn over the last few years but things are starting to stabilize,"" he said in an interview.
""There's definitely cause for some optimism over the next few years but exploration certainly takes a while to turn into something significant in terms of production or new developments,"" he added. ""Those timelines are quite long.""
Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore contrasts with Nova Scotia's, where natural gas production ended in 2018. ""At this point things are moving in the right direction for Newfoundland and Labrador's offshore,"" Brannon concluded.
Challenges remain, however, including the industry's hunt into deeper water, further offshore. The first big test in that deep water could arrive if Equinor decides to proceed, with partner Husky, in developing the Bay du Nord project. Discovered in 2013, the project's 300 million barrels of recoverable oil are located in water 1,200 metres deep, nearly 500 kms offshore. (The four existing projects are all roughly 350 kms offshore, in depths of roughly 100 metres).
""This is not what you call a walk in the park,"" Unni Fjaer, a vice-president at Equinor Canada, said in an interview. ""We definitely need to do more work on the project to be more definitive on (our) answer.""
The industry is eagerly hunting for more oil (and, potentially, natural gas) but that pursuit is shadowed by climate change and the fact that while filling part of global demand for oil, new production will contribute to further warming.
The industry's response is that global oil demand will continue to rise in the coming decades, particularly in China and India, so it's best if that appetite is satisfied, in part, by oil from Canada's East Coast, where environmental and safety regulations are stronger than in other areas of the world.
According to Keating, the goal is to make Newfoundland and Labrador's product the ""oil of choice"", which will make it more valuable.
""I think it's incumbent on us, as long as there's a hydrocarbon window open, that we drive this, drive this economy,"" he said. ""As long as the world needs hydrocarbons, Newfoundland and Labrador should continue to be a place where we look for those barrels.""

| Jump to first hitBy Minister of Petroleum and Energy Kjell-Børge FreibergMinister of Petroleum and Energy Kjell-Børge Freiberg held this speech at Equinor's Aumtun Conference 2019 at the Norwegian Theatre in Oslo.Checked against delivery.Ladies and gentlemen,Dear friends!I wish you a warm welcome to this conference, to discuss our future challenges - and opportunities - in the energy sector.A special welcome to Dr. Fatih Birol of the International Energy Agency, who will present the latest World Energy Outlook.Let me focus on some key points from a Norwegian perspective.To sum up the Energy Outlook as short as possible: ""More energy, lower emissions"".The world faces several huge challenges, as addressed in the UN sustainable development goals.A growing world population, the need for increased standards of living, economic growth, cleaner air, energy for all, and not least, climate action.The challenges are closely connected. They are global, demand global solutions, and must be worked out at the same time.Economic growth and increased standard of living require energy.The global energy system is huge and complex, and is growing every year.The use of energy is today three times higher than in 1965. Increased use of energy has provided better living standards for several hundred million people.Therefore, energy is, and will be, key to deliver on the sustainability goals.At the same time, global emissions from energy use have never been higher than in 2018.How does we square this circle?There is no quick fix.Climate actions must be global. The total efforts under the Paris Agreement is the sum of all parts delivered.Every country must take actions to address these issues.Norway is doing its part:First, by being active on all relevant international arenas where climate solutions are discussed.By working hard to support an international climate regime, including the Paris Agreement.By co-operating with the most ambitious countries in the world, the EU member states.A key element of our climate policies is that our industry, including the oil companies, is part of the EU emission trading system. Through the system, they will reduce emissions by 43 percentfrom 2005 to 2030.Second, Norway also delivers at home. We have an ambitious climate policy, in all sectors of society. The oil and gas sector, has had tax on its CO2-emissions for almost 30 years.We will also continue to develop Norway as a renewable nation.With a carbon free power system, we are in a unique position, compared with most other countries.I am pleased to see the increase on wind and solar power globally. However, it accounts for only four percent today.They cannot replace oil and gas in the near future as oil and gas cover more than 50 percent of the world's energy use.The International Energy Agency reminds us that the world will need oil and gas for a long time ahead.Also within the sustainable development scenario where the sustainability goals are met - demand will be high. To keep up with the demand for oil and gas, new and large investments to produce these resources will be necessary for the years to come, also in Norway.This is an important argument for our oil and gas policyAnd let me tell you right away:what we do has a purposeit is part of the solution,and an answer to the challenges we are facing. One example is the Aasta Hansteen platform in the Norwegian Sea.Not only is the field providing activity and employment in my part of the country.It is also the first gas field north of the Arctic Circle delivering gas in pipelines directly to Europe.In terms of volume the gas from Aasta Hansteen could heat one of four households in the UK- or one of four cups of tea.At the same time, it contributes to lower emissions.It helps reduce the use of coal, and supports intermittent renewables like wind and solar.This summer Britain had its first coal free week since 1882. Made possible by the combination of renewable energy, and Norwegian gas.Our gas is a key to the transition to a low emission society, not only in the UK, but also in other countries in Europe.In the long run, gas can be decarbonized and reformed into hydrogen, with the CO2 captured and stored.This photo is another illustration of our policy: the first oil sample from the Johan Sverdrup field. A truly happy day!Sverdrup illustrates many aspects of our industry:The field will produce for at least fifty years, meaning that we will have a petroleum industry for decades.An industry that will continue to create jobs, welfare and contribute to our pension fund, which recently passed...10 000 billion kroner!But Sverdrup is also about low carbon production.With renewable power from land, the CO2 emissions from Sverdrup is only 700 grams per barrel produced. The world average is 18 kilos!Finally, let me share an example from when I visited Marine Aluminium outside Haugesund.They are specialized in the production of bridges and helipads for the petroleum sector. Now, they also deliver solutions for the ocean wind industry.This shows us that we:have a supply industry, which adapts.are now building a bridge between petroleum and renewables.and, that technology developed in the oil and gas segment is used also in new areas. Looking ahead, where is this industry going?If you want to shape the future, you first need to understand the past.This year we are celebrating the discovery of Ekofisk - fifty years since the birth of Norway as a petroleum nation.Many pioneers deserve credit for this adventure.Such as the people working in the industry.And those representing technology, research and development, leading to innovations such as subsea technology or new ways of drilling.Innovations that have made the activity on our continental shelf faster, cheaper and cleaner.And the industry itself, companies like Equinor, deserves credit.Today, an international energy brand, heavily involved in tomorrow's energy solutions.And not least, visionary politicians. Like former Prime Minister Trygve Bratteli. At Ekofisk in 1971, he said the famous words: ""This could be a turning point in Norwegian economic history"".One of the biggest understatements in Norwegian history.Looking ahead, we still need:Visionary politicians,The fantastic innovations from the industry, research and technology,And a skilled workforce. I strongly believe we are part of the solution and the answer.That we represent best practice.That is why I am surprised when some say we should set an end date to our production of oil and gas.I disagree.Reducing Norwegian production will likely have no impact on the global emissions.It will put tens of thousands of highly profitable jobs - and our welfare - at risk.And it will weaken a knowledge base fundamental for developing our society towards a low carbon future.Such as Carbon Capture and Storage or CCS. A necessary technology to reach our climate goals.Such as hydrogen as a low carbon solution.Or using offshore technology for ocean windOr using aquaculture to provide food for a global population.Or extracting minerals from the seabed for energy storage, batteries, smart phones and electrical cars. The list is long.And it convinces me, and hopefully you, that there is no contradiction between being ambitious on climate and having a long-term perspective on our petroleum activity.We will build on our proud and profitable petroleum industry to continue and develop our high standards, and to provide the foundations for a sustainable future.Again, more energy, lower emissions.Thank you, so much, for your attention!Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitNorwegian oil company Equinor has failed to satisfy the regulator that it can prevent and manage an oil spill, protect marine life and adequately consult if it is allowed to conduct deep-sea drilling in the Great Australian Bight.
It's the second time Australia's offshore oil and environmental safety watchdog has asked Equinor to modify and resubmit its plan, as it seeks approval to explore the seas off the South Australian coast.
The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority said it had given Equinor 21 days from last Friday to respond to a request to modify and resubmit its environment plan.
The regulator has sought more information about Equinor's plans to consult widely in the community, manage oil-well pressure, prevent an oil spill, contain an oil spill or protect marine life under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.
""The opportunity to modify and resubmit does not represent a refusal or rejection of the environment plan,"" the authority said in a statement posted on its website yesterday.
Critics of the project want Equinor banned from drilling in the Bight because they fear oil spills in the extremely rough waters could threaten fishing areas and pristine coastlines thousands of kilometres away on Australia's east and west coasts.
Greenpeace campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said the regulator's decision was a ""comprehensive knock-back"". ""They already had provided a plan, which NOPSEMA rejected because there were too many gaps. They tried to fill those gaps this time around but they clearly haven't,"" he said.
Mr Pelle said the company was unable to meet the regulator's demands for one simple reason: ""It's not possible to drill safely in the Bight.""
The company plans to start drilling exploration wells in late 2020, approximately 400 km south-west of Ceduna and 476 km west of Port Lincoln in 2240-metre deep waters.
""The petroleum activity will occur any time between October and May during the three years validity period from 2020 to 2022. No drilling will take place between June to September inclusive,"" it said.
A report by the Australia Institute has found that through its sovereign wealth fund's two-thirds ownership of Equinor, the Norwegian government stands to make $8.1 billion from oil and gas exploration in the Bight.
The think-tank calculates that Norway stands to gain $400 million more from drilling in the Great Australian Bight than the South Australian and federal governments combined.
Equinor had not responded to requests for comment by deadline.

| Jump to first hitThe Norwegian State's net cash flow from the petroleum industry in 2020 is estimated to about NOK 245 billion.The fields on the Norwegian continental shelf cover around two per cent of the world's oil demand and three per cent of the world's consumption of gas. The activity on the shelf today is high, which is necessary to maintain value creation, government revenues and employment over time.New fields are expected to start in the next few years. The Sverdrup and Castberg fields in particular will contribute to an increase in total production, as the new fields more than compensate for natural decline in production in existing fields. In 2023, total production from the Norwegian continental shelf is expected to hit the record high levels from 2004.- The petroleum sector is Norway's biggest industry and the most important contributor to the financing of the welfare state. For the foreseeable future it will remain our largest industry in terms of revenue, value creation, investment and the number of jobs. This is due to a policy that stimulates new fields to bbe discovered, and resources that can replace existing, depleting fields, says Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Mr. Kjell-Børge Freiberg.The state's net cash flow from the petroleum activities is estimated in the national budget at NOK 238 billion in 2019 and NOK 245 billion in 2020. The revenues include taxes, revenues from the state's direct financial commitment (SDFI) and dividends from Equinor. In 2020, the estimated net cash flow from the shelf will increase the transfer to the oil fund equivalent to NOK 185,000 for a family of four.This figure includes direct and indirect taxes, revenues from the State's Direct Financial Interest (SDFI) and dividends from Equinor.The opportunities on the Norwegian continental shelf are still great. Of the total recoverable resources of 15.6 billion standard cubic meters of oil equivalent, only 47 percent were sold and delivered at the end of 2018.- The activity level on the Norwegian continental shelf in terms of exploration, development and operation is at a high level. We expect it to remain so over the coming years. This is a high-tech industry. The fact that the oil companies continue to invest in exploration and further extraction of petroleum has positive learning and productivity effects, not only between supplier companies within the industry, but also between companies in the petroleum industry and other parts of the economy. It contributes to a broader, more robust and knowledgeable business structure, says Freiberg.Investments on the Norwegian continental shelf are expected to be around NOK 173 billion in 2020. The total investment base constitutes just under one fifth of the total real investment in Norway. In the following years, a slight decline in investment is expected. From a historical perspective, they are still expected to remain at a high level. Today, there are 85 fields in production, and significant investments are made in existing fields so that the recovery rate increases and the service life is extended. In the longer term, the level of activity depends on continuously making new discoveries.Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitEUROPEAN gas producers are well placed to withstand the downturn in prices for at least a year, according to a new report from S&P Global Ratings.
The analysis comes as a welcome boost to the industry, which saw prices fall to their lowest in a decade in early September. However, S&P warned that if the downturn continued for longer than expected, companies would have to adjust their strategies in order to preserve their resilience.
The combination of an unexpectedly mild winter in 2018 and oversupply caused by the commissioning of substantial new natural gas capacity has kept prices low since early 2019.
S&P examined supermajors Shell, BP and Total, as well as companies such as Equinor, and Gazprom.
A number of factors are responsible for gas companies' resilience to low prices, including diversification, lower competitive costs, and meaningful headroom in their financials.
According to the report, Gazprom and Equinor are the companies most vulnerable to a continued downturn in prices over the next year."

| Jump to first hitEQUINOR, the Norwegian oil company, yesterday reiterated flat forecasts for 2019 production despite a significant decline in the volume of natural gas sold to Europe.
Commenting on the third-quarter update, chief executive Eldar Saetre said: ""We maintain strong cost and capital discipline, but our results are affected by lower commodity prices in the quarter.""
The decline was offset by confirmation from the company that its Johan Sverdrup oil field, the third largest resource in the North Sea, was on track to meet phase one targets of 440,000 barrels by summer 2020.
Despite operations only starting this month, daily production at the field has already risen above 200,000 barrels. By the end of November, it is expected to reach 300,000.
Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, analyst at Sparebank 1 Markets, said that the news implied two to four per cent earnings per share potential on 2019-2020 estimates. Shares yesterday closed up slightly at 0.45 per cent.
Total oil and gas production at Equinor in the third quarter was 1.9m barrels of oil per day, eight per cent below the same period in 2018. Gas production off Norway alone fell by 17 per cent, while average European gas prices were down 26 per cent.
Equinor also made impairment charges of $2.8bn (£2.2bn), with $2.2bn related to its onshore shale oil and gas assets in North America on ""more cautious price assumptions"".
Clean-up and repair costs from September's Hurricane Dorian, which damaged Equinor's Bahamas oil terminal, totalled $537m.
The company said it had managed to recover about a third of 119,000 oil barrels spilled when the hurricane ripped the roofs of a number of the terminal's oil tanks."

Climate change means that oil producers such as Norway face a serious dilemma. An offshore field, one of the largest found anywhere, has this past weekend begun production.
Sweden's Lundin Petroleum, the Johan Sverdrup oilfield's discoverer, and operator Equinor of Norway, have tried to show how black crude can be the new green. That is no easy task.
The field's success has long been coming. Until the beginning of this millennium the Norwegian continental shelf was run by a few big oil groups, including then state-run Statoil. Its privatisation (which rebranded it Equinor) plus tax incentives for exploration encouraged more drilling.
Lundin hit pay dirt on Johan Sverdrup in 2010. With Equinor as the operator, plus partners Aker BP and Total of France, this oilfield will eventually produce 660,000 barrels daily. This is almost a third of Norway's output, and the largest oilfield in the entire North Sea.
Reconciling that carbon gush with Norway's green credentials is tricky. By mostly powering offshore platforms with onshore hydropower from the Norwegian grid, the field's owners claim CO2 emissions of 0.67kg per barrel of oil. Compare that with a global average of 18kg per barrel. There is no escaping the fact that the crude itself generates about 24 times that, but it is a decent start.
Green concerns have yet to weigh on Lundin shares. Johan Sverdrup accounts for three-quarters of its worth. The driller's share price return has more than doubled over five years. Equinor and indeed the MSCI World Energy index have been less fortunate, falling in value — in dollar terms. In 2020 its return on its capital employed will hit 50 per cent, says Berenberg.
Saudi Aramco touts these sort of numbers ahead of its IPO, but with little hope of expanding its output.
A promise of high production growth has boosted Lundin's market value, not some green revolution in lifting this crude."

UK regulators have issued a warning to Norwegian energy giant Equinor over adverts on the London Underground that implied gas is a ""low-carbon energy"" source, in the first such assessment by the advertising watchdog.
The UK Advertising Standards Authority, ASA, told the Norwegian statebacked energy major not to use the adverts again after a complaint was submitted about a poster spotted in Westminster Tube station.
In an email seen by the FT to Murray Worthy, who lodged the complaint, the watchdog said Equinor had agreed not to use the ad again and to make changes if it runs a similar campaign The ASA told Mr Worthy, who is senior campaigner at the NGO Global Witness: ""They [Equinor] said that their intention was only to refer to wind power as low carbon but acknowledged that the ad might not have been interpreted in that way.""
The poster, with the Equinor logo at the top, claimed in large print against a backdrop of a coastline and blue sky: ""We're the low carbon energy just over the horizon."" In smaller print below, it said: ""Equinor is Britain's biggest supplier of imported gas — and a key provider of UK wind power too."" The regulator said it would not release details on the case until Wednesday.
The resolution delivers a blow to fossil fuel companies' attempts to portray gas to politicians and the public as environmentally friendly and part of the solution to climate change.
Mr Worthy pointed to evidence from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, saying that gas has the third-highest carbon dioxide emissions intensity of commercial technologies.
""There is no gas that can be considered 'low carbon' in the same way that wind energy can be considered 'low carbon',"" he said. ""These companies need to stop trying to mislead politicians.""
Carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas are about 40 per cent lower than coal and about 20 per cent lower than oil, according to the International Energy Agency, but it releases about 40 times more CO2 than wind power.
However, some experts argue that the comparison with renewables is unfair since gas is needed as a ""bridge fuel"" in the transition to cleaner energy.
Equinor supplies a fifth of Britain's gas from fields in the North Sea, operating three wind farms off the UK and is developing carbon capture and storage technology.

| Jump to first hitMajor oil companies have approved US$50 billion of projects since last year that will not be economically viable if governments implement the Paris Agreement on climate change, think-tank Carbon Tracker said in a report published on Friday.
The analysis found that investment plans by Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Exxon-Mobil among other companies will not be compatible with the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
""Every oil major is betting heavily against a 1.5-degree Celsius world and investing in projects that are contrary to the Paris goals,"" said report co-author Andrew Grant, a former natural resources analyst at Barclays.
Big oil and gas companies have welcomed the UNbacked Paris Agreement, in which governments agreed to curb greenhouse gas emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.
Scientists view 1.5 degrees Celsius as a tipping point where climate impacts such as sea-level rise, natural disasters, forced migration, failed harvests and deadly heatwaves will rapidly start to intensify if it is breached.
Carbon Tracker's analysis, co-authored by Mike Coffin, a former geologist at BP, found that 18 newly approved oil and gas projects worth US$50 billion could be left ""deep out of the money"" in a lower carbon world.
The projects include Shell's US$13 billion liquefied natural gas (LNG) Canada LNG project, a US$4.3 billion oilfield expansion project in Azerbaijan owned by BP, Exxon, Chevron and Equinor, and a US$1.3 billion deepwater project in Angola operated by BP, Exxon, Chevron, Total and Equinor.
The report also concluded that oil and gas companies risk ""wasting"" US$2.2 trillion by 2030 on new projects if governments apply stricter curbs on greenhouse gas emissions.
Previous reports on the implications of climate change for oil and gas companies by Carbon Tracker and other researchers have contributed to a wave of investor pressure on majors to show that their investments are aligned with the Paris goals.
While some companies including Shell, BP, Total and Equinor have increased spending on renewable energy and introduced carbon reduction targets, the sector says it needs to continue investing in new projects to meet future demand for oil and gas as Asian economies expand.
Shell said in a statement that it has set out an ""ambition"" to halve net carbon emissions by 2050 ""in step with society as it moves towards meeting the aims of Paris.""
""As the energy system evolves, so is our business, to provide the mix of products that our customers need,"" Shell said.
BP said its strategy to produce low cost and low carbon oil and gas was in line with the International Energy Agency (IEA)forecasts and the Paris agreement.
""All of this is aimed at evolving BP from an oil and gas focused company to a much broader energy company so that we are best equipped to help the world get to net zero while meeting rising energy demand,"" the company said in a statement.
Exxon, Chevron, Equinor and Total did not reply to requests for comment.
Nevertheless, the latest Carbon Tracker report said the big oil and gas companies spent at least 30 per cent of their investment last year on projects that are inconsistent with the path to limit global warming to even 1.6 degrees Celsius.
""These projects represent an imminent challenge for investors and companies looking to align with climate goals,"" the report warned.
Carbon Tracker's calculations were based on three scenarios produced by the Paris-based IEA models of oil and gas supply under different warming pathways.
With fossil fuel supply on course to outstrip demand if the world is to limit warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report assumed that the projects with the lowest production costs would be the most competitive.
""Demand for oil can be satisfied with projects that break even at below US$40 per barrel and pursuing higher-cost projects risks creating stranded assets that will never deliver adequate returns,"" the report said.
Benchmark crude futures were trading at around US$62 per barrel on Thursday.

| Jump to first hitNORWEGIAN state oil giant Equinor yesterday launched a $5bn (£4bn) share buyback as it also promised to bring a massive new oil field online earlier than expected.
The firm said that it would immediately start repurchasing $1.5bn in shares, and will complete that first tranche before the end of February.
Shares bounced on the news, closing the day up 9.15 per cent to €16.70.
""We have over the last years built a strong financial position with solid credit ratings and a net debt ratio around 20 per cent,"" said chief executive Eldar Saetre.
The company's main shareholder, Norway, will keep its 67 per cent stake undiluted.
Meanwhile, Equinor said it would start pulling oil from the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea in October, a month ahead of what it had expected.
In a note, UBS analysts said the progress on the field and the buyback ""signals positive progress from the board"". ""We believe sector shares are cheap,"" they said, pointing to the fact that the company's shares have fallen 21 per cent so far this year when measured in US dollars.
The field, which was the biggest discovery in the North Sea for three decades, will produce cheap energy for the company.
It comes as other firms, especially US majors, scale back from the dwindling basin.
Yesterday, Reuters revealed that US giant Exxon Mobil has agreed to sell all its assets in Norway for $4bn. Exxon did not confirm the reports.
The news would mark the end of Exxon's business in the country after more than a century there.
It comes after the firm in June said it was looking to sell the portfolio, including stakes in several fields run by Equinor and Shell.
Exxon-owned parts of the 20 fields produced around 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017.
Sources told Reuters that the company has held talks with Equinor and a handful of other potential buyers. The sources did not reveal which of the potential bidders has won the race for the fields.
Exxon is reportedly also looking to sell its British North Sea stakes."

The cash return had the potential to reduce its share count by nearly 9 per cent by the end of 2022.
Equinor also brought forward the first oil from its Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea by a month to October.
""Equinor shares have closely tracked European gas prices lower in recent months and we think investors need to be confident in a temporary inflection before jumping back in,"" said RBC. ""The start-up of Johan Sverdrup due later this year could provide a much-needed catalyst.""

| Jump to first hitEnova has decided to grant Equinor, along with its partners, NOK 2.3 billion in a funding commitment for what could turn out to be the world's largest floating offshore wind park.The development of floating offshore wind is an important milestone for Norway, and for the world. This is an industry where Norwegian business and industrial companies along with expertise and technology communities have an opportunity to be at the international forefront. That can contribute to more profitable jobs, new industry and increased value creation all across the country, says Prime Minister Erna Solberg. Floating offshore wind could become an enormous energy resource if we succeed in reducing costs, which would help floating wind become competitive with other energy sources in a long-term perspective. The state's decision to support Hywind Tampen through Enova represents a contribution toward demonstrating a technology that can cut greenhouse gas emissions, and has a potential for global proliferation. This pledge of support is the largest ever granted from Enova.If we can curb the costs associated with floating offshore wind, the technology could be applied in many countries, thus reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. The state is an important advocate when the business community develops new climate technology. That is why the government has substantially increased budget appropriations to Enova since 2013. That has given them the financial muscle to support projects of this scope, says Minister of Climate and Environment Ola Elvestuen.The floating offshore wind park that Equinor and the other licensees on the Gullfaks and Snorre fields want to establish will consist of a total of 11 floating wind turbines, of 8 MW each. The turbines will produce 384 GWh of renewable power annually, which will replace one-third of the current power requirement on these platforms. The project will thus also contribute to reducing CO2 emissions by approx. 200,000 tonnes every year the platforms are in operation. Nevertheless, the emission cuts are not the primary reason for Enova's support for this project.For us, this funding is about bringing floating offshore wind one step closer to commercialisation, and all the positive ripple effects this could have both for the global climate challenge and Norwegian business and industry, for a very long time to come. This is precisely the type of initiative Enova must support to fulfil our role as a driving force in this transition, says Enova's CEO, Nils Kristian Nakstad.Floating offshore wind has an advantage over bottom-fixed solutions as the technology can be used in deeper waters. Nevertheless, the world has just one floating offshore wind farm, namely Hywind Scotland, developed and operated by Equinor. This wind farm consists of five wind turbines of 6 MW each. While bottom-fixed offshore wind has experienced rapid development and is in the process of becoming competitive, more progress is needed before floating offshore wind is profitable.While Enova has now given a funding commitment of NOK 2 329 800 000 for the project, there are still some hurdles to pass before the project is realised. Equinor and its partners must make a final investment decision, and EFTA's supervisory body ESA must approve the grant. A change in the power supply on Snorre and Gullfaks requires an investment decision by the licensees, and that the authorities then also approve an amended Plan for Development and Operation (PDO) pursuant to the (Norwegian) Petroleum Act. Part of this process will involve an assessment of considerations relating to the natural environment and aquaculture, including impact on fishery activities. If all goes according to plan, the wind farm will commence operation during the course of 2022.Source: Government of Norway"

| Jump to first hitWith its lively waterfront, tree-lined canal, and redbrick buildings topped by steep gunmetal-grey roofs, Aarhus looks like just another coastal city in Northern Europe. But get closer, and what comes into focus is a place central to the continent's remarkable shift to renewable energy. Down by the docks, at a facility nestled among huge oil tanks that reek of the past, the world's biggest wind-turbine maker tests parts for these gargantuan machines of the future. Meanwhile, in offices all across Denmark's second-largest city, fast-growing cadres of energy traders are making big bucks from the volatility that wind and solar power generate.
This didn't happen by accident.
What would ultimately become Vestas Wind Systems A/S started as a blacksmith shop in 1898 on the western edge of Jutland, a windswept peninsula sandwiched between the North Sea and southern Sweden. Until the 1970s the company's products ranged from milk coolers to steel window frames. As Denmark, a net energy importer, was stung by that decade's oil crises, Vestas turned its hand to alternative energy. Early turbine prototypes - including one that looked like a giant egg whisk - were developed in secret. After several decades building up its wind-turbine business, the company moved its headquarters to Aarhus, Jutland's biggest city.
Today wind regularly meets more than half of Denmark's demand for power.
As the country's reliance on wind has grown, Aarhus and surrounding towns have become a renewable energy melting pot - of manufacturers and suppliers, traders and analysts, specialist lawyers and academics. China's largest maker of wind turbines, Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., has a research office here. In 2016 energy and environmental companies accounted for the port city's second-biggest export industry (after food), according to the latest available data from the municipality. ""Renewable energy plays a huge role in the city,"" says Mayor Jacob Bundsgaard. ""It's not just Vestas.""
Traders sometimes liken Aarhus to the Swiss commodities hubs in Geneva or Zug. Judging from the low turnover rates at local trading firms, the city (population 345,000) offers enough to keep people from shoving off to Copenhagen or London or beyond. Besides the buzz of the work, the attractions range from the cosmopolitan ambience provided by Aarhus University to four restaurants with Michelin stars. ""Aarhus more than lives up to big brother Copenhagen's reputation as a foodie destination,"" says Soren Jessen, a Danish former banker who owns restaurants in London.
Bundsgaard, 43, has been mayor since 2011. Most mornings, typifying the municipality's mission to become carbon neutral by 2030, he cycles to work at city hall. Aarhus, where CO2 emissions have been cut in half over the past decade, has built a 110-kilometre electric tram network and will introduce electric buses this year. Wastewater treatment plants are ordinarily very energy-intensive; Aarhus's produces 40 per cent more power than it consumes.
Perhaps the most striking monument to Aarhus's place in the world of renewable energy is a biomass plant that opened in 2017. Atop a hill at Lisbjerg, on the edge of the city, three enormous 45-metre-high glass boxes soar above a landscape of farms and woodland. More than 60 trucks a day deliver agricultural straw to the plant when it's running at full capacity. Next door, in another box, there's an older waste facility. Here, 150 trucks a day dump rubbish that's incinerated at 1,000C (1,832F). Both plants produce electricity and pump hot water into the Aarhus district's heating system. ""We're almost free from coal now,"" Bundsgaard says.
To get onto one of the trading floors at Danske Commodities A/S, you take a glass walkway across a shallow pool of water whose murmuring lends an air of tranquillity to the space. For the traders, it can be a place of respite: The markets they cover are anything but calm.
While many assets may move a percentage point or two at most during a daily session, intraday electricity contracts can jump or slump at many times that rate. All it takes is a sudden drop in wind or a few unexpected hours of sunshine. This volatility has spurred the development of a niche industry here. DC is the biggest of the 10 or so companies in Aarhus that specialize in Europe's power and natural gas markets, which together were worth 1.65 trillion euro (US$1.85 trillion) last year, according to Prospex Research Ltd.
A gas trader named Henrik Lind founded DC in 2004. He'd spotted an opportunity to profit from price differentials across geographical markets and began to move power between Denmark and Germany. The company, whose profit rose 28 per cent to 72 million euro in 2018, has about 300 employees and operates in about 40 markets. Equinor ASA, a Norwegian oil major, bought out Lind, who owned a majority of DC, and other shareholders for 400 million euro in a deal that was completed in February. Lind is staying on as board member.
Bolstered by US$100 million in capital from Equinor in the second quarter of this year, DC is expanding, looking to buy more capacity on international power cables and more gas storage capacity on the continent. Pursuing an expansion strategy it calls Level Up (after the computer-gaming term), it will start trading in the U.S. power market this year following its foray into Australia last year.
Helle Ostergaard Kristiansen, DC's chief executive officer since April, says the expansion won't stifle the startup ethos instilled by Lind. ""It is part of our DNA, that entrepreneurial culture that we want to maintain,"" says Ostergaard Kristiansen, who began working at DC in 2010.
That spirit is exemplified by Cagdas Ozan Ates, a Turk who acquired a master's degree in finance and international business at Aarhus University. He joined Lind at DC as one of its first employees when it was little more than a small office with a handful of computers and stayed for more than a decade in various senior roles.
Last year, Ates was appointed CEO at MFT Energy A/S.
In a departure from DC, which had been built around a strong majority owner, MFT's plan is to set up partnerships that will give traders a larger share of profits.
Lind ""always asked, 'What else can we do tomorrow, what can we do better?'says Ates. ""We learned a lot from him. And we took it with us.""
As more countries turn to wind and solar to replace polluting fuels, markets have become more turbulent and rich in opportunities for trading companies. In Germany, the largest European electricity market, consumers have spent many billions of euros to help finance ""climate chancellor"" Angela Merkel's green economy agenda, her double-edged strategy to phase out both coal and nuclear energy. Trading in contracts for power delivered the same day in Germany last year surged 13 per cent to a record high on Epex Spot SE, the main exchange for such markets.
As more companies pile into the intraday power market, margins on trades are decreasing and more and more deals are automated. While individual trading companies don't disclose the ratio of machine-to human-led transactions, 37 per cent of the German intraday market was automated last year, according to Epex. Automation is constantly taking the speed of transactions to new levels. DC has set up a server in Frankfurt that will cut execution time to 6 milliseconds from 24 milliseconds.
Jesper Johanson is taking no chances. He runs another Aarhus-based trader, In-Commodities A/S. Since he co-founded the company in 2017, it's grown to almost 40 employees. To feed the next growth phase, Johanson says he's hiring developers as well as traders. ""We are just as much an IT company as we are a commodity trader,"" he says.
Vast swaths of flat farmland dominate the west coast of Jutland. About the only thing that breaks up the landscape is the dispersed forest of turbines that convert wind from the gusty North Sea into electricity.
One of them, a Vestas V112 model, towers almost 100 metres above a farm that grows everything from carrots, cabbage, and potatoes to parsley and dill. The spread's proud owner also happens to be Vestas's chief technology officer, Anders Vedel, 62.
Vedel's interest in wind was first roused when he was a young child sailing the waters north of Copenhagen.
This melded fortuitously with an attraction to tech: Also as a youngster, he built his own solar-heated water system. Even so, he remained a full-time farmer until he was in his early 30s, when he set out to receive a mechanical engineering degree.
When he got his start at Vestas in Lem, Jutland, in 1995, the biggest blades the company made were 19 metres long; today they stretch to 73 metres, or a bit longer than the wingspan of a Boeing 747. Over that time, the power capacity of the turbines has increased more than tenfold.
In the early days, the cost of producing power with wind was much higher than anybody would willingly pay. So a company like Vestas, with a tiny customer base at the time, was at the mercy of government subsidies, tax breaks, and tariff exemptions in the countries where it did business.
Last year wind supplied 5 per cent of the world's total power output. As the industry has matured in recent years, nations have been able to scale back their support and switch to auctions, forcing both utilities and suppliers such as Vestas to narrow their profit margins.
Today onshore wind in Europe is competitive with conventional power sources, or nearly so. In Spain, wind technology's so-called levelized cost of energy (the unit cost of electrical energy over the lifetime of a generating asset) dropped 41 per cent from 2016 through the first half of this year, according to BloombergNEF, Bloomberg LP's primary research service on energy transition.
Markets and the turbine industry are becoming increasingly linked. Vedel says his turbine is regularly switched off when wind speeds exceed about 9 metres per second because of plunging prices. And who's switching it off? The folks over at DC.
""It's good that we drive down the cost of energy, and we'll still focus on that,"" Vedel says. The challenge is this: If energy costs fall too quickly, turbine manufacturers won't be able to get a sufficiently large return on their own investments. At that point, Vedel says, ""the industry starts to have a problem.""
So far, Vestas hasn't reached that stage, according to Jacob Pedersen, head of equity research at Sydbank A/S, based in Aabenraa, Denmark, who's tracked the company for almost two decades. ""The sharp drop in prices has hit the competitors harder,"" he says. ""Vestas still has the best profitability in the industry.""
To stay ahead, Pedersen says, Vestas needs to keep doing what it's doing well and also to innovate. A team of more than 70 people in Aarhus has been tasked with thinking beyond wind to help the company become a global leader in sustainable energy - including connecting wind, solar, and storage batteries. Wind will always be at the centre of what the company does. Bo Svoldgaard may be Vestas's head of innovation and concepts, but even he says wind is ""our heart and soul.""
It's clear where Vedel's heart is. ""From my living room and kitchen, I can see 22 turbines,"" he says. ""I wanted to tear down another building on the farm because some of them I can't see very well. But my wife said, 'Stop!'""

Royal Dutch Shell PLC's profit plunged in the second quarter, with
lower oil and gas prices
and weaker refining margins outweighing a rise in production.
The Anglo-Dutch oil giant's results came in well below expectations and marked a poor quarter for energy majors, suggesting that their efforts to rejig and diversify their portfolios haven't fully cushioned them from swings in oil and gas prices and refining margins.
Brent crude—the global benchmark—traded around 7% lower in the second quarter compared with the previous year and European and Asian gas prices were down sharply.
Across the industry, there was also a slowdown in demand for chemicals, Shell said.
France's Total SA and Norway's Equinor ASA both reported profit declines last week and missed analysts' expectations. However, BP PLC beat expectations, reporting quarterly profits that were flat compared with the comparable period a year earlier.
Many energy companies slashed their portfolios in the wake of the oil price collapse in 2014, with a focus on keeping only the most profitable assets and cost-cutting where possible. Shell completed a $30 billion divestment program last year and plans to sell another $10 billion worth of assets by the end of 2020.
At its management day in June, the company said it intended to sell or close nine of its 19 refineries by 2025.
""We think we'll end up with something like 10 [remaining refineries] and these will be really the top-notch refineries that have longevity and resilience through the cycle,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Thursday.
U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are set to report their results Friday.
Exxon Mobil warned earlier in July that weaker natural gas prices and margins from its chemicals business could weigh on its second-quarter profit.
Shell reported a lower plant utilization in chemicals and a loss in refining in its quarterly results.
""This is always a much bigger issue for Exxon and Shell [than their peers],"" Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein said, referring to weaker margins in refining and chemicals.
Shell said its quarterly profit on a current cost-of-supplies basis—a number similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $3.03 billion, down from $5.23 billion a year earlier. Adjusted results missed the company-provided analyst consensus by almost a third.
Its shares closed 6.5% lower on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Shell's chemical plants operated at 85% availability for the quarter, down from 93% a year earlier, due to strike action in the Netherlands and maintenance.
Its rising output, bolstered by fields in North America, wasn't enough to offset lower commodity prices. Shell's production rose 4% to 3.58 million barrels a day compared with a year earlier. Its output is also expected to rise in the third quarter as production ramps up from some fields and liquefied natural gas projects.
Total and BP also posted solid production increases. After the 2014 oil price collapse lead to dramatic cuts to investment plans, companies are back
investing in new production
, albeit sometimes in the form of acquisitions rather than developing their own exploration finds.
Total is on track to raise production by 9% this year, helped by its acquisition of Maersk Oil's assets which closed a year ago, alongside projects starting up, including in Angola and the North Sea.
""In Shell's case for instance we do have the startup of several major projects that are contributing to production growth,"" said Jefferies equity analyst Jason Gammel, adding that some of these, including the Appomattox project in the Gulf of Mexico, were sanctioned before the 2014 downturn.
Shell's cash flow from operations rose to $11.03 billion from $9.5 billion in the prior-year period.
It has pivoted toward gas production since its 2015 deal to buy BG Group PLC, known for its global liquefied natural gas business.
After the acquisition, Shell committed to a $25 billion share buyback program, which it launched last year. The company said it would buy back $2.75 billion of shares in the next tranche, in line with the first quarter of 2019.
The company maintained its quarterly dividend at 47 cents a share.

A pasta factory in rural south-west Italy is not the obvious location for an energy project that could show how to cut emissions from Europe's vast industrial sector.
But the Orogiallo factory, in Contursi Terme in the province of Salerno, made a small slice of history this year when it cooked its pasta using a blend of hydrogen and natural gas that had been injected into the Italian gas transmission grid.
Hydrogen has been touted by scientists and companies as a potential ""clean"" replacement for fossil fuels such as natural gas as it does not produce carbon dioxide when burnt. Businesses and governments are this year renewing efforts to investigate whether hydrogen could help decarbonise key sectors of the global economy, from industry and power, to shipping and transport.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency has described 2019 as a year of ""unprecedented momentum"" for hydrogen, with 50 policies or targets introduced globally to support its development.
Stephan Herbst, technical general manager for hydrogen at Toyota Motor Europe, said: ""The game-changer is the Paris agreement. There is now a consensus that we need to decarbonise transport and other sectors and we need all energy sources.""
In the case of the Contursi Terme project in April, although the proportion of hydrogen used was just 5 per cent, the month-long pilot by Italian utility Snam was the first of its kind in Europe testing how safely and reliably it could be injected into national gas infrastructure, an area that is tightly regulated.
Snam, and other gas infrastructure owners in Europe, intend to raise the percentage of clean hydrogen used in future projects in the hope it may one day replace natural gas and secure the future of their assets.
The Snam project is just one example of hydrogen projects planned across the world by big companies including Norwegian oil major Equinor, Swedish power company Vattenfall, Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, National Grid of the UK, and Toyota.
For energy groups, hydrogen, which can be produced from fossil fuels, could offer a way of securing a function for their natural gas reserves in an environment where more governments are adopting policies to end their contribution to global warming.
Transport companies view it as a possible solution for industries such as shipping or freight or as an alternative to electric vehicles.
But hydrogen has enjoyed several waves of popularity before, for instance in the 1970s, 1990s and early 2000s, and has so far failed to take off in the way envisaged by companies such as General Motors, which first produced a hydrogen-powered vehicle in 1966.
The number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, such as the Toyota Mirai, in circulation last year was just 11,200, according to the IEA, which is small compared with other low-emissions cars such as battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
Previous waves of enthusiasm for hydrogen failed as they were largely based on its use as a cleaner fuel for passenger cars at a time when oil prices were low, damping appetite among consumers and companies to invest in hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.
Hydrogen, whose clean credentials depend on how it is produced, still polarises opinion, with critics questioning costs and safety. But companies behind hydrogen schemes are hopeful that this time will be different. Planned schemes include powering ferries on hydrogen, using it as a replacement for natural gas in domestic boilers, and as a way of storing excess electricity produced by renewables such as wind and solar on particularly sunny and windy days.
In Eemshaven, on the northern tip of the Netherlands, Swedish energy company Vattenfall is exploring whether part of a gas-fired power plant can be successfully converted to run on hydrogen by 2025.
The immediate effect will be to reduce the emissions from that plant. But the wider purpose is to explore whether excess renewable electricity could be used to produce clean hydrogen via electrolysis — a process that also uses water — before being stored. It could then be used to generate electricity during winter or when wind or solar farms are not producing.
""With increasing amounts of renewables in the electricity system, there will be increasing demand for flexible [electricity generation] capacity and seasonal storage,"" said Jeffrey Haspels, the project manager for the scheme at Vattenfall.
However, the project, which also involves Norwegian oil company Equinor, Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems and the Dutch energy network company Gasunie, highlights some of the challenges of using hydrogen, in particular costs.
Mr Haspels estimates the cost at ""€1bn plus"" across the value chain, referring to the separate stages of producing the hydrogen, storage and transportation and conversion of the plant. A final investment decision, to be made in 2022, will be dependent on subsidies from the Dutch government.
For this trial, the hydrogen will be produced from natural gas as ""the situation of having sufficient renewables in the system is not there at the moment in the Netherlands"", said Mr Haspels, although it is envisaged future projects would use electrolysis.
Hydrogen is already widely produced from fossil fuels, about 70m tonnes a year, to make fertilisers or for use in oil refining, but this process is heavily polluting. It is responsible for CO2 emissions of about 830m tonnes a year, equivalent to the carbon emissions of the UK and Indonesia combined, according to the IEA.
To make that hydrogen ""clean"", the emissions have to be captured, re-used in processes such as fizzy drink manufacturing or stored in depleted oil and gasfields offshore.
Many experts believe this will still be the most cost-efficient way of producing low-emissions hydrogen at an industrial scale, although carbon capture usage and storage technology has its own cost challenges.
""One has to recognise that all this [fresh] momentum and all the talk about hydrogen doesn't mean the challenges are all of a sudden non-existent,"" says Timur Guel, head of energy technology policy at the IEA.
Companies admit early projects will require government funding but dramatic falls in costs of other green technologies such as solar and wind provides optimism the same could happen with hydrogen.
Hydrogen projects may also start to look competitive as costs for emitting CO2 rise, in countries that have carbon taxes or emissions schemes, says Emmanouil Kakaras, vice-president and head of research and development at Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems Europe.
""We have to benchmark these [hydrogen] technologies with what we call CO2 avoidance costs,"" he said.
In a world where more countries follow the likes of France, Norway, Sweden and the UK in adopting net zero emissions targets, more alternatives to fossil fuels will simply have to be pursued, says Stephen Bull, senior vicepresident of wind and low-carbon development at Equinor.
""This is beyond business as usual. The decarbonisation strategy we have for [the] electricity market has been relatively successful, but it's nowhere near going to get us to a zero-carbon world. This is where we do think hydrogen has a strong role to play.""'We need to decarbonise transport and other sectors and we need all energy sources'

A pasta factory in rural south-west Italy is not the obvious location for an energy project that could show how to cut emissions from Europe's vast industrial sector.
But the Orogiallo factory, in Contursi Terme in the province of Salerno, made a small slice of history this year when it cooked its pasta using a blend of hydrogen and natural gas that had been injected into the Italian gas transmission grid.
Hydrogen has been touted by scientists and companies as a potential ""clean"" replacement for fossil fuels such as natural gas as it does not produce carbon dioxide when burnt. Businesses and governments are this year renewing efforts to investigate whether hydrogen could help decarbonise key sectors of the global economy, from industry and power, to shipping and transport.
The Paris-based International Energy Agency has described 2019 as a year of ""unprecedented momentum"" for hydrogen, with 50 policies or targets introduced globally to support its development.
Stephan Herbst, technical general manager for hydrogen at Toyota Motor Europe, said: ""The game-changer is the Paris agreement. There is now a consensus that we need to decarbonise transport and other sectors and we need all energy sources.""
In the case of the Contursi Terme project in April, although the proportion of hydrogen used was just 5 per cent, the month-long pilot by Italian utility Snam was the first of its kind in Europe testing how safely and reliably it could be injected into national gas infrastructure, an area that is tightly regulated.
Snam, and other gas infrastructure owners in Europe, intend to raise the percentage of clean hydrogen used in future projects in the hope it may one day replace natural gas and secure the future of their assets.
The Snam project is just one example of hydrogen projects planned across the world by big companies including Norwegian oil major Equinor, Swedish power company Vattenfall, Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems, National Grid of the UK, and Toyota.
For energy groups, hydrogen, which can be produced from fossil fuels, could offer a way of securing a function for their natural gas reserves in an environment where more governments are adopting policies to end their contribution to global warming.
Transport companies view it as a possible solution for industries such as shipping or freight or as an alternative to electric vehicles.
But hydrogen has enjoyed several waves of popularity before, for instance in the 1970s, 1990s and early 2000s, and has so far failed to take off in the way envisaged by companies such as General Motors, which first produced a hydrogen-powered vehicle in 1966.
The number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, such as the Toyota Mirai, in circulation last year was just 11,200, according to the IEA, which is small compared with other low-emissions cars such as battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
Previous waves of enthusiasm for hydrogen failed as they were largely based on its use as a cleaner fuel for passenger cars at a time when oil prices were low, damping appetite among consumers and companies to invest in hydrogen fuelling infrastructure.
Hydrogen, whose clean credentials depend on how it is produced, still polarises opinion, with critics questioning costs and safety. But companies behind hydrogen schemes are hopeful that this time will be different. Planned schemes include powering ferries on hydrogen, using it as a replacement for natural gas in domestic boilers, and as a way of storing excess electricity produced by renewables such as wind and solar on particularly sunny and windy days.

| Jump to first hitSupporters of two offshore wind projects in development off Long Island say they will spark a wave of investment to make the Empire State a leader in renewable energy development.The projects Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced July 18 are slated for completion within five years, when they will provide 1,700 megawatts of electricity. The governor also signed the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act that same day, calling for a nation-leading 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind generation by 2035. ""The environment and climate change are the most critically important policy priorities we face,"" Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a statement. “But cries for a new green movement are hollow political rhetoric if not combined with aggressive goals and a realistic plan on how to achieve them.” The wind projects are designed to be an integral part of New York State’s plan to have 70% of its electricity derived from renewable sources by 2030 under the climate act that Cuomo signed. The bill also requires 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040 and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85% overall by 2050.Cuomo awarded contracts for the two wind farms to Norway-based Equinor and Bay State Wind LLC, which is a joint venture of Denmark’s Orsted A/S and Massachusetts-based Eversource Energy. The two projects, which would power one million homes, are projected to generate 1,600 jobs and a combined economy activity of $3.2 billion statewide, Cuomo said at the July 18 signing where he was joined by former Vice President Al Gore. Resilience financing expert Alan Rubin, a partner with Blank Rome LLP, said that bonds will likely play a big role in funding much of the two wind projects. The bonds would need to be approved by public referendum, which Rubin said would likely face little trouble if the proposed borrowing is reasonable because many people across New York are grappling with extreme weather and energy challenges. “Climate is a major factor and everyone experiences it directly,” said Rubin of why a ballot measure for a renewable energy project would likely receive strong support. “People are experiencing the issue and they are looking for a solution.” Rubin said it will be vital for the state and federal government to fund large portions of the projects and provide incentives to get the private sector involved in order to keep borrowing costs in line. He noted that higher costs that will face ratepayers as the state gears up for wind and other alternative energies will also create obstacles toward a smooth execution of Cuomo’s goal. “It will have to be done incrementally,” Rubin said. “It can’t be cost prohibitive in the beginning.” Another wind project located near Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, has encountered rough waters amid battles over permits and financing. Vineyard Wind, a joint venture of Avangrid Inc. and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners K/S, was seeking debt financing for an estimated $2.15 billion phase of the project earlier this year. The 800-megawatt initiative is in the midst of a comprehensive public and regulatory review process involving more than 25 federal, state and local regulatory government bodies. “There are a lot of complexities with offshore wind,” said Robert Bryce, an energy specialist at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research. “It’s not going to be easy and it’s not going to be cheap.” The planned 816-megawatt Empire Wind project by Equinor would supply renewable power from just east of the Rockaways in New York City and about 20 miles south of Long Island. Cuomo said the project should bring “significant and long-term” economic benefits utilizing South Brooklyn as its operations and maintenance base. Construction is anticipated to begin in 2022 with the project slated to commercial operation in December 2024.The 880-megawatt Sunrise Wind project by Bay State Wind is supported by Con Edison Transmission and the New York Power Authority, who will support development of the project's transmission facilities. Cuomo said Orsted and Eversource are planning to co-locate a North American operations headquarters in Port Jefferson, Long Island, that will be capable of supporting Sunrise Wind and other affiliated U.S. projects. Construction on Sunrise Wind, 30 miles east of Montauk Point, Long Island, adjacent to Eversource and Orsted’s South Fork Wind Farm and Revolution Wind projects, is scheduled to commence in 2022 with an estimated completion date of May 2024.Bryce said 1,700 megawatts from the two wind projects won’t even be enough to replace capacity that will be lost from Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear facility in Westchester County scheduled to close in 2021. Bryce noted that while costs for offshore wind have dropped, it remains the most expensive renewable energy source and expected opposition from commercial fishermen will only add to the implementation challenges. “Anytime you do anything in salt water it gets expensive very quick,” said Bryce, who was fellow at the Institute for Energy Research prior to joining the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. “It is a heavy lift.” Anthony Figliola, vice president of Empire Government Strategies, said the Long Island wind turbines build on the state’s recent momentum with making major infrastructure investments such as redeveloping New York City’s two airports and connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Manhattan’s Grand Central Terminal. He said the state’s aggressive investments in wind energy have the potential to create an industry cluster of wind power producers and suppliers that would generate new permanent jobs to stimulate the local economy.“New York is positioning itself as the leader of wind power in the U.S.,” said Figliola, who runs his Uniondale, N.Y.-based government relations consulting practice with former New York State Assemblyman Jerry Kremer. “This investment is just one in a long line of major capital investments the state has undertook as part of its own Marshall Plan to rebuild our aging infrastructure while putting people to work.”"

Pirelli gained on an upgrade to ""overweight"" from JPMorgan Cazenove.
The tyremaker's move upmarket should help protect it from a sector suffering from low volumes, high inventories and pricing pressure, JPMorgan said. With high-value tyres expected to provide two-thirds of Pirelli's sales this year, the company had the potential to generate best-in-class profit margins, it added.
Swedish explorer Lundin Petroleum gained after agreeing an asset swap with Equinor.
Lundin said it would buy back a 16 per cent equity stake in itself from Equinor for $1.56bn, an 8 per cent discount to Friday's closing price, while selling its Norwegian peer a 2.6 per cent stake in the Equinor-operated Johan Sverdrup oilfield for $962m.
Aker BP followed Lundin higher as the asset swap revived speculation about a possible merger between the North Sea explorers.

Eldar Saetre, chief executive of Norwegian energy group Equinor, says he is preparing for a time when oil and gas companies face tougher penalties for hydrocarbon extraction.
The irony of Mr Saetre's strategy will not be lost on many: his state-controlled company, until last year known as Statoil, has been a key driving force behind the creation of Norway's $1.1tn oil fund, ranked as the world's largest sovereign wealth fund.
Even as the world's reliance on fossil fuels persists, he says, capital allocation by investors, policy and public sentiment will all shift in favour of cleaner fuels.
So how does a traditional energy major prepare for a move towards a lowcarbon future and what impact will this have on its asset portfolio? ""You will see regulation, more of it, costs attached to emissions, and that will be on top of other operating costs and development costs,"" Mr Saetre tells the Financial Times.
He says there is an ""enormous"" difference between the most and least carbon-intensive resources. ""That distinction is going to be more and more important.""
With the growing threat of carbon taxes and pricing on production as well as consumption, and heightening environmental campaigning against oil and gas companies, the hunt is on for individual producers to deliver ""cleaner"" barrels.
Equinor, like a growing number of its peers, is trying to avoid the most carbon-intensive reservoirs, which emit huge volumes of carbon dioxide and other destructive pollutants when extracted and processed. Dirtier projects such as Canadian tar sands developments have fallen out of favour in recent years, not only because some oil and gas companies have committed themselves to pursue ""cleaner barrels"" but because this extraction was often the most expensive.
Lucky for Equinor, oilfields in Norway are some of the lowest carbon intensity in the world. Extraction is powered in part by hydropower and emissions have been regulated on the continental shelf for over a decade.
""If you're trying to sanction new projects and you want to know if these projects are going to be economic in the future, then this metric is important to understand,"" says Amy Bowe at Wood Mackenzie, the energy consultancy.
Anywhere between 15 and 40 per cent of the total greenhouse gases generated by petrol, diesel and other transport fuels are generated before they even emerge from the refinery following extraction and transportation, according to industry studies. By this ""wells to wheels"" measure of the carbon intensity of production, Venezuela and Canada are among the countries delivering oil with a particularly high carbon footprint. This is because their reserves are based on heavy oils including tar sands and are particularly energy-absorbing to extract.
Research conducted by Stanford University published last year showed that nearly 9,000 oilfields in 90 countries — accounting for 98 per cent of the crude oil and condensate produced in 2015 — created greenhouse gases equivalent to 1.7 gigatons of carbon dioxide. But the carbon intensity of oil production per barrel or equivalent varied widely by source: accounting for the energy used to extract heavier, more viscous oils, and the associated and unwanted gas that is released and often flared — or burnt.
Understanding the future impact of carbon pricing and taxes is becoming a growing part of mainstream conversation in the energy industry when assessing the viability of future projects and the value of assets. Ms Bowe says understanding the full extent of ""how the carbon cost is imposed"" is vital.
Meanwhile, analysis of the carbon intensity of particular oil and gasfields is becoming more important to energy majors as they come under pressure from campaigners and some shareholders to disclose emissions rates of current and future planned projects.
Saudi Arabia, the world's leading oil exporter, has made a virtue of the fact that it flares little gas and has easy access to prolific resources of oil with low water content, which means less energy goes into treating and separating this oil. The kingdom in recent months has escalated a campaign to make this known.
But producers who demonstrate an intent to impose best practice and concentrate on the least polluting energy projects still cannot satisfy many campaigners who insist they must take responsibility for all greenhouse gases, including those released by the burning of their fuels by consumers. These socalled ""scope three"" emissions by end consumers, BP and Equinor argue, are ones they have no control over.
Other companies such as Shell and France's Total have acknowledged they must be held accountable in some way for these emissions too. ""The emissions released from our own production are very small. Without addressing 'scope three', there is no point [in setting emissions targets at all],"" says a top executive at one European oil major.The carbon intensity of oil production per barrel or equivalent varies widely by source

This transaction gives us the opportunity to capitalize on this value creation, and at the same time increase our direct ownership in the Johan Sverdrup field,” said Eldar Sætre, president and CEO of Equinor.Under the terms of the agreements, Equinor will divest around 54.5 million shares in Lundin at a price of SEK266.4 ($28.22) per share, an Equinor statement said.Total consideration for the divestment of shares in Lundin amounts to around $1.56 billion. Equinor will acquire a 2.6 per cent direct ownership share in the Equinor operated Johan Sverdrup field for a cash consideration of $910 million.Through this transaction, Equinor is realizing significant value creation from its investments in Lundin Petroleum. Equinor announced its investments in Lundin in 2016 at an average weighted cost price of SEK 121 per share, adjusted for the divestment of International Petroleum Corporation. Equinor has more than doubled the value of its invested capital, including its remaining shareholding in Lundin Petroleum.“Johan Sverdrup is truly a world class field. We are on track to start production in November this year, and an increased direct ownership share gives us the opportunity to create even more value for our shareholders,” said Sætre.Following completion of the transactions, Equinor will have a 42.6 per cent ownership share in the Johan Sverdrup field and own a 4.9 per cent shareholding in Lundin Petroleum.The agreement includes a contingent payment of up to $52 million payable to Lundin in 2025 if Johan Sverdrup proves to be at the upper end or above the indicated resource range of 2.2 – 3.2 billion boe. In agreement with Lundin, the transaction is being executed through a total return swap agreement, where the Lundin shares will be acquired by Sparebank1 Markets and subsequently redeemed.The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including customary government approval and approval in Lundin Petroleum AB’s Extraordinary General Meeting set for July 31.

Norway's decision to force its sovereign wealth fund to sell out of some oil producers is ""crazy"" and singles out his company, says the chief executive of Lundin Petroleum, one of Europe's largest independent producers.
Alex Schneiter said that almost no other oil company operating in Norway would be affected by the ban as they are either Norwegian-based — meaning the $1tn national oil fund is not allowed to own them — or an oil major, groups which are unaffected by the measure.
Swedish-listed and Swiss-based Lundin has been the most successful exploration company in Norway in recent times, being responsible for half of the country's discoveries — including the Johan Sverdrup field, with up to 3bn barrels of oil.
""You have this crazy situation where one company has done so much for Norway and through this regulation we are to be sold. It's such a minus. It upset me,"" Mr Schneiter told the Financial Times.
The ban was passed by Norway's parliament this month, and affects only oil groups classified as exploration and production companies. It therefore excludes all majors such as BP and ExxonMobil, which have other activities. Experts on the Norwegian oil fund have criticised the government for what they see as a politically motivated decision, designed to placate an environmentally friendly group in the fourparty governing coalition.
Mr Schneiter argued that to follow Norway's logic the fund needed to reduce its exposure to oil across the board. ""Either do it for everyone, or you don't do it at all,"" he said.
He also said that sovereign wealth funds born out of the petroleum sector — Norway's is funded entirely from its oil and gas revenues — should not sell out of it.
Norway's finance ministry said the country derived most of its oil and gas revenues from exploration and production activities. ""This measure is about diversification. Hence, it is more accurate to sell companies which mainly explore and produce oil and gas, rather than selling a broadly diversified energy sector,"" it said.
The oil fund is Lundin's seventh-largest shareholder with a 1.2 per cent stake. Its second-largest shareholder is Equinor, the Norwegian state-controlled oil group that has a stake of 20.1 per cent.
Lundin is heavily exposed to Norway, where it has nearly all of its production, and Mr Schneiter was at pains to point out that the company's experience of the country ""is positive in general"".
He brushed aside worries about Norway's politicians moving against oil companies after its biggest party, the opposition Labour party, voted to bar the industry from the picturesque Lofoten islands, regarded by some as its next big potential petroleum region.
Instead, Lundin is focusing further to the north, in the Arctic region of the Barents Sea, where it has made some small discoveries but has also drilled several dry wells.
Mr Schneiter insisted that his company ""still believed in the Barents"" despite a number of high-profile blanks from Equinor and others. But he added that Lundin would have to consider pulling out if it failed to find anything in the next three years.
""I would be disappointed if in the next two to three years we don't prove you wrong ... It's a huge area but we don't really understand how the Barents work. We haven't unlocked the geology yet,"" he said.
Lundin is positioning itself as one of the producers with the lowest carbon emissions as investors put pressure on companies to disclose their impact on the climate. He said Lundin had emissions of less than 1kg of carbon dioxide per barrel produced, against an average for Norway of about 10kg and for the world of 20kg.
""We are at a crossroads where some businesses become doomed. We have always been conscious that the world is changing. In this transition, the oil companies have a certain role to play, provided you are prepared to make some investments,"" he said.
He rejected suggestions that Lundin is trying to get around the Norwegian ban by moving into renewables. But he said that over time the company could diversify. ""I wouldn't be surprised if one day Lundin Petroleum is called Lundin Energy. We could explore other areas,"" he said.
Mr Schneiter is facing a war crimes investigation in Sweden over allegations that Lundin Petroleum's role in oil exploration in Sudan sparked an uprising that caused thousands of deaths. The chief executive, who was head of exploration for Lundin at the time, was warned last year, together with Ian Lundin, the company's chairman, that they were likely to be charged with aggravated crimes against human rights. Both men strenuously deny any such claims.
""Whatever happens, I know we will prevail. The impact is to two individuals, not the company. But I wish for nobody to go through this,"" he said, adding that Lundin's role in Sudan was a ""force for good"".

Norway's decision to force its sovereign wealth fund to sell out of some oil producers is ""crazy"" and singles out his company, says the chief executive of Lundin Petroleum, one of Europe's largest independent producers.
Alex Schneiter said that almost no other oil company operating in Norway would be affected by the ban as they are either Norwegian-based — meaning the $1tn national oil fund is not allowed to own them — or an oil major, groups which are unaffected by the measure.
Swedish-listed and Swiss-based Lundin has been the most successful exploration company in Norway in recent times, being responsible for half of the country's discoveries — including the Johan Sverdrup field, with up to 3bn barrels of oil.
""You have this crazy situation where one company has done so much for Norway and through this regulation we are to be sold. It's such a minus. It upset me,"" Mr Schneiter told the Financial Times.
The ban was passed by Norway's parliament this month, and affects only oil groups classified as exploration and production companies. It therefore excludes all majors such as BP and ExxonMobil, which have other activities. Experts on the Norwegian oil fund have criticised the government for what they see as a politically motivated decision, designed to placate an environmentally friendly group in the fourparty governing coalition.
Mr Schneiter argued that to follow Norway's logic the fund needed to reduce its exposure to oil across the board. ""Either do it for everyone, or you don't do it at all,"" he said.
He also said that sovereign wealth funds born out of the petroleum sector — Norway's is funded entirely from its oil and gas revenues — should not sell out of it.
Norway's finance ministry said the country derived most of its oil and gas revenues from exploration and production activities. ""This measure is about diversification. Hence, it is more accurate to sell companies which mainly explore and produce oil and gas, rather than selling a broadly diversified energy sector,"" it said.
The oil fund is Lundin's seventh-largest shareholder with a 1.2 per cent stake. Its second-largest shareholder is Equinor, the Norwegian state-controlled oil group that has a stake of 20.1 per cent.
Lundin is heavily exposed to Norway, where it has nearly all of its production, and Mr Schneiter was at pains to point out that the company's experience of the country ""is positive in general"".
He brushed aside worries about Norway's politicians moving against oil companies after its biggest party, the opposition Labour party, voted to bar the industry from the picturesque Lofoten islands, regarded by some as its next big potential petroleum region.
Instead, Lundin is focusing further to the north, in the Arctic region of the Barents Sea, where it has made some small discoveries but has also drilled several dry wells.
Mr Schneiter insisted that his company ""still believed in the Barents"" despite a number of high-profile blanks from Equinor and others. But he added that Lundin would have to consider pulling out if it failed to find anything in the next three years.
""I would be disappointed if in the next two to three years we don't prove you wrong ... It's a huge area but we don't really understand how the Barents work. We haven't unlocked the geology yet,"" he said.
Lundin is positioning itself as one of the producers with the lowest carbon emissions as investors put pressure on companies to disclose their impact on the climate. He said Lundin had emissions of less than 1kg of carbon dioxide per barrel produced, against an average for Norway of about 10kg and for the world of 20kg.
""We are at a crossroads where some businesses become doomed. We have always been conscious that the world is changing. In this transition, the oil companies have a certain role to play, provided you are prepared to make some investments,"" he said.
He rejected suggestions that Lundin is trying to get around the Norwegian ban by moving into renewables. But he said that over time the company could diversify. ""I wouldn't be surprised if one day Lundin Petroleum is called Lundin Energy. We could explore other areas,"" he said.
Mr Schneiter is facing a war crimes investigation in Sweden over allegations that Lundin Petroleum's role in oil exploration in Sudan sparked an uprising that caused thousands of deaths. The chief executive, who was head of exploration for Lundin at the time, was warned last year, together with Ian Lundin, the company's chairman, that they were likely to be charged with aggravated crimes against human rights. Both men strenuously deny any such claims.
""Whatever happens, I know we will prevail. The impact is to two individuals, not the company. But I wish for nobody to go through this,"" he said, adding that Lundin's role in Sudan was a ""force for good"".

 State Secretary Rikard Gaarder Knutsen held this speech at an industry seminar by Northern Lights-partnarane, Equinor, Shell & Total, Fortum og HeidelbergCement in Düsseldorf, Germany on June 12th 2019.
 Ladies and Gentlemen. It is truly nice to be invited to speak here in Düsseldorf - in the industrial heartland of Germany and Europe and on such an important topic for Europe and the World. I look forward to interesting presentations and discussions.
 The entire world faces a tremendous task:
 We have to build a sustainable future. We have to find solutions to combat climate change. We need to provide more food, more jobs and more energy. This will require action from all of us. And we owe it to future generations. Environmental issues and getting a job is something especially young people are more and more concerned about. The big question is - how to solve these challenges at the same time?
 One of the pieces in this puzzle will have to be CCS, in particular in the industry sector and to contribute to negative emissions, so-called BECCSIn IPCC's special report on the impacts of global warming of 1,5 degree Celcius, CCS is identified as necessary in the majority of the scenarios if we are to reach the targets in the Paris Agreement. CCS is also one of seven necessary building blocks in the European Commision's proposal for a long-term strategy for Europe.
 CCS is also an enabler of hydrogen in a low-emission society. Several countries, including Japan and the UK, have high ambitions for using hydrogen in the transition to a low-emission society. Hydrogen also works well with intermittent renewables because of its ability for energy storage. The more hydrogen available, the more renewable energy from wind and solar can be added to the grid.
 From a Norwegian perspective CCS is one of five prioritized areas of climate efforts. We have an ambition to realise a cost effective solution for full scale CCS in Norway, provided this will result in technology development internationally.
 The Norwegian government is fully committed to realising a full-scale demonstration project that makes a crucial difference to maturing CCS into commercial use. BUT that commitment is contingent on a conviction that the Norwegian project will work as a catalyst for other European projects and international technology development.
 We see a growing recognition for the necessity of accelerating clean energy transition and increased climate action as well as an emerging momentum for technologies that can bring Europe to climate neutrality. The EU commissioner on energy and climate, Mr. Arias Cañete, and the Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy, Mr. Freiberg, has invited to a High Level Conference on CCS in Oslo on September 5th this year. This will be a good opportunity for European Ministers, leaders from key European companies and other key stakeholders to discuss these topics.
 We are looking at capturing CO2 from industrial sources. The project is now in the last planning phase before investment decision with two capture projects;
 Norcem, a subsidiary of HeidelbergCement, will capture CO2from their cement production. Fortum Oslo Varme will capture CO2 from their Waste to Energy facility in Oslo. I believe you will get more details on the projects from Heidelberg and Fortum later today. From the industrial sources the CO2 will be transported by ship to a CO2-hub on the west coast of Norway. A partnership consisting of Equinor, Shell and Total are conducting this part of the project. The CO2 will then be sent through a pipeline to a safe CO2 storage site located underground on the Norwegian Continental shelf. Our latest cost estimates indicate an investment cost for capture, transport and storage to approximately 1-1.3 billion Euros.
 Why do we think it makes sense to do this in Norway?
 We have 50 years of experience from oil & gas development on the Norwegian Shelf where we have vast storage capacity which makes it possible to store CO2, also from European countries.
 We have more than 20 years of experience from CO2 storage at an offshore gas field called Sleipner and 10 years from CO2storage at a gas field called Snøhvit. It is safe to store CO2 and we have regulations that ensure this safety also in the future.
 We have developed a research community with global reach centered around the CO2 Technology Centre at Mongstad where technology companies can test their technologies at an industrial pilot scale.
 The objectives of the Norwegian government for storage and transport of CO2 on the Norwegian Continental Shelf is to contribute to sustainable energy and industrial production by accommodating the exploitation of sub-seabed reservoirs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf for environmentally safe CO2-storage.
 The Norwegian full scale project is a true European project - strengthened by a great blend of European companies: Equinor, Shell, Total, Fortum and Heidelberg, and they are supported by European construction and engineering contractors.
 This project is unique because it commercially de-links capture and storage. The storage facilities will have more capacity than what is needed for capture projects in Norway. The additional capacity is an important foundation for faster proliferation of CCS in Europe - and the level of utilisation of this capacity is the key indicator of the project's success.
 We want the full-scale project to be an enabler for capturing CO2from industries that are difficult to decarbonise without CCS.It might also contribute to negative emissions by capturing CO2 that is already in the natural carbon cycle. Some important European industries have limited or no alternatives to CCS if they are to become decarbonised - for instance, cement, steel and chemicals. CCS will contribute to preserving European jobs and industries in a low-emission society.
 To realize the full potential of the CCS project, there are also some regulatory issues that we have to solve. I am confident that we will find solutions to make this happen.
 Per Sandberg, representing the Northern Lights CO2-transport and storage-project will talk more about what is needed to store your CO2 on the Norwegian Continental Shelf later today.
 There is a great push from the Norwegian government and the involved companies, Norcem, Fortum, Equinor, Total, Shell, but we need to see a lot more pull:
 From industries that need to implement CCS in a low-emission society From European countries, that need CCS if they are to meet the Paris commitments The project is not straightforward, there are many issues that need to be resolved prior to a final investment decision, which we aim for in 2020. We will only make the investment if we believe that this will be the first of many, rather than the last of a few, CCS projects. I'm glad for this opportunity to present the project and to discuss what is needed for CCS to happen. The project is not run by the government. It's a commercial project - developed by commercial companies. However, there is a need for some support to get the ball rolling. Earlier this year we agreed that the state will sponsor 75 per cent of the well cost (up to 35 million Euros) to explore a storage location in the North Sea. For the government it is important that the total costs are manageable, but it is also important that the industry picks up a large share of the costs and risks.
 The Norwegian State is entering into a phase with tighter budgets and we will need to make priorities. We now have little more than a year left until the final investment decision. I urge you to spend that year on making this investment proposal irresistible - commitments from European industry, the EU and member states are vital for the Norwegian government's decision. I appreciate the companies' hard work to develop activity - and I am truly looking forward to learn more about how this looks from a European perspective at today's seminar.

| Jump to first hitClimate Action 100+ is a coalition of investors led by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and sustainability nonprofits. Together, the group has more than $33 trillion in assets under management.CA100+ is pushing the corporations that are the largest greenhouse-gas emitters to agree to plans that will lower these emissions, and to be transparent throughout.Since launching at the end of 2017, it has had success with energy giants Shell, BP, Glencore, and Equinor, and shipping-industry leader Maersk.This article is part of our ongoing series on Better Capitalism.
At its annual general meeting in May, 99% of BP's shareholders passed a resolution requiring the oil and gas giant to be transparent about how it's lowering carbon emissions each year. The request came from Climate Action 100+, a group of 338 institutional investors with more than $30 trillion in assets under management.
Investors are pushing the world's largest fossil fuel companies, as well as the world's other largest greenhouse-gas emitters, to change their policies and become more transparent, with an urgency and momentum that hasn't before existed at this scale.
""Investors are an important part of this discussion,"" Ceres CEO Mindy Lubber told Business Insider. Ceres is a sustainability nonprofit that helped develop CA100+, and Lubber sits on its board. ""They're not the only part, but they're owners of the company; they're not campaigners. They don't want to see the company die — they own the company. They want to see them make smart changes.""
The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) is the United States' largest pension fund, with around $360 billion in AUM, and its long been involved in shareholder activism. After the Paris Agreement was drafted in 2015 and signed in 2016 — committing signatory nations to keeping climate change from reaching 2ºC above pre-industrial levels — CalPERS worked with researchers to identify the world's 100 corporations contributing the most to climate change. California controller Betty Yee and Lubber connected with leaders of three other investor groups to create a global coalition that would compel these companies to gradually transform their businesses before it became too late.
The CA100 launched at the end of 2017, and the ""+"" was added when they targeted another 61 companies the following July.
The coalition's board recognized the severity of the climate crisis, but their fundamental pitch could win over the most jaded executives: If you don't change your business, you won't have one down the line. There is now a scientific consensus that among the effects of man-made climate change is a massive hit to the economy. The US government's Fourth National Climate Assessment released in November stated that the US economy will shrink by 10% by the end of the century if the current pace of climate change continues.
The CA100+ will last for five years, but Lubber said that the investors won't suddenly abandon their goals. The idea was to use the coalition to make a big impression together and let that momentum carry forward.
Lubber said that notable changes since its formation have been Europe's largest oil and gas company, Royal Dutch Shell, committing to lowering its emissions (including those created by customers using its fuel) with specific targets, as well as breaking ties with lobbying groups not aligned with these goals; mining company Glencore doing the same and also committing to halt expansion of its coal business; energy company Equinor committing to a public annual review of its emissions and how they're meeting targets; and the leading shipping container company Maersk committing to reaching 0 net carbon emissions by 2050. And then, more recently, was BP's commitment to transparently keeping its strategy tied to the tenets of the Paris Agreement.
At its annual general meeting, BP's shareholders rejected a resolution from another climate-centered activist investor group, Follow This. In an op-ed published in the Financial Times the morning of the meeting, BP's chairman Helge Lund said that his company could not be held accountable for the emissions of its customers — though critics could point out that its rival Shell adopted that very same plan.
Lubber said that while CA100+'s members are motivated by urgency, they are also maintaining a level of patience. ""For some of these companies, we're asking them to radically change what they do as companies.""
It's a difficult task, but one they consider necessary.
""Whether it's easy or not is not the question,"" Lubber said. ""It's very hard to get there. But it's a lot harder to imagine the consequences."""

French energy giant Total SE and international contractors were scrambling to evacuate staff from a $20 billion natural-gas project in northern Mozambique on Saturday, security officials and analysts said, as a deadly attack by Islamic State-linked insurgents on a nearby town entered its fourth day.
The siege on the coastal town of Palma, which serves as hub for the U.S.-supported project, began on the day that Total announced it would gradually recommence work at its nearby liquefied natural gas plant, citing Mozambican government efforts to improve security in the area.
Total, which took over the project from Anadarko Petroleum in 2019, had pulled out nonessential staff in early January, following an attack that reached the gates of the LNG plant on the Afungi peninsula. The plant and offshore gas fields, one of which is operated by Exxon Mobil Corp., are the largest foreign investment project on the African continent. Construction has been delayed by the escalating insurgency .
Some 2,600 people have been killed in the impoverished Cabo Delgado province, about half of them civilians, since Oct. 2017, while more than 600,000 have been driven out of their homes.
Several hundred insurgents entered Palma early Wednesday morning, indiscriminately firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades at civilians and into homes, according to Human Rights Watch and Focus Group, a risk-management company that supports clients operating in the area.
Hundreds of locals fled into the surrounding forest and inside the fenced-off LNG plant.
Some 180 people sought refuge at Amarula Lodge, a hotel and restaurant complex on the outskirts of Palma that is a popular hangout for expatriates working on the gas project as well as local officials, according to a person familiar with the security situation in Palma.
Human Rights Watch cited eye witnesses. Joe van der Walt, chief executive officer of Focus Group, said he had received reports and images of bodies on the streets and beaches of Palma.
A spokesman for South Africa's foreign ministry said that several South Africans had been caught up in the attack and it was verifying local media reports that one of its citizens had been killed.
Communications and power networks around Palma were interrupted hours after the attack started, making it difficult to verify the situation on the ground.
A European security official said Total was evacuating project staff from Afungi.
Total said it had decided to reduce its workforce at the Afungi site to a strict minimum, adding the company had suffered no casualties. ""The remobilization of the project that was envisaged at the beginning of the week is of course now suspended,"" a spokesman for the French oil company said.
A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said it continues ""to monitor security developments in the region"" but didn't comment further.
Two people familiar with the security situation in Palma said they believed the insurgent group was primarily targeting banks and food supplies in the city rather than energy assets.
Locally known as both Al-Shabab and Al-Sunna wa Jama'a, the insurgents have launched increasingly violent and sophisticated attacks across Cabo Delgado, often beheading or otherwise mutilating their victims.
Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department said the insurgents were an Islamic State franchise and designated them as a foreign terrorist organization for the first time.
A dozen U.S. Special Forces are currently training Mozambican marines on a two-month mission to help them fight the group. Mozambican police and military, supported by private-security contractors from South Africa, have failed to contain the insurgency. Amnesty International and other rights groups say they have documented atrocities against civilians allegedly committed by government and private security forces. The government and the security contractors have denied the allegations.
Mr. van der Walt said the timing of this week's attack on Palma showed that Mozambican forces still lacked the necessary intelligence to get ahead of the insurgents. ""You can have the best-trained force, the best-equipped force, but if you don't have intelligence, what can you do,"" he said. For that, the government has to address longstanding grievances among a local population that feels neglected, Mr. van der Walt said.
The U.S. Embassy in Maputo said Friday it remained committed to working with the government to tackle the ISIS franchise and reported intense fighting between government troops and terrorist forces.
As the siege has dragged on, the situation inside the Amarula hotel has become increasingly dire. In a video from inside the compound shared on Thursday, an unidentified man said Palma had been under attack for more than 24 hours, and it was unclear whether plans to evacuate the hotel would work out. ""The situation is critical. We don't have food. We only have water,"" the man said, while a helicopter can be heard hovering overhead.
On Friday, some of the hotel guests tried to flee by road and were attacked by insurgents, one of the people familiar with the security situation in Palma said.
The siege on Palma has struck at the heart of Mozambique's burgeoning natural-gas developments, which have attracted some $60 billion in investments, four times the country's $15 billion annual economic output.
Total's LNG project is backed by $4.7 billion in funding from the U.S. Eximbank, which says it is supporting some 16,700 American jobs during its lifespan and providing business to 68 suppliers in states including Louisiana, Florida and Tennessee. Eximbank didn't return a request for comment.

| Jump to first hitRenewable energy assets are in a bubble that has led to a string of deals with ""crazy"" valuations, according to the chief executive of Total SE, one of the world's biggest oil and gas companies.
The warning from Patrick Pouyanné comes as the industry's heavyweights are caught between sustaining fossil fuel-based businesses that generate the bulk of both their profits and the cash for dividends, while facing louder calls to increase investment in clean energy.
Total is no exception. In a wide-ranging interview, Pouyanné said he wants the group to be recognized not ""as an oil and gas company, but as an energy company.""
The Paris-based multinational has pledged billions in renewables investment, targeted net-zero emissions by 2050 and proposed renaming the company TotalEnergies, which its shareholders will vote on in May.
However, ""there is a bubble"" in the renewables sector, Pouyanné cautioned. Valuations that are often up to 25 times earnings are ""just crazy today,"" the Total chief added, putting that down to the short supply of assets of a significant scale. They are ""too scarce.""
Total was one of several major oil companies, BP PLC among them, that earlier this month paid what one analyst described as ""staggering"" prices for the leases to U.K. offshore wind projects.
In a thinly veiled swipe at BP, which was part of the highest-bidding consortium, he said: ""When we come, we don't pay too much.""
With European oil and gas companies under particular pressure to steer their portfolios toward cleaner forms of energy, Pouyanné is not shocked at the frenzy over renewables as sellers seek out the deepest pockets.
""I will not buy, but I think I would not be surprised to see one of my European peers spending money,"" he said. ""A banker came to me (about another deal) and said 'If you don't buy it, BP will buy it'. I said, OK, but at this price, why should I buy that? Explain it to me.""
BP's Dev Sanyal, who is responsible for its alternative energy business, said last week that value is the ""key driver"" when the group does deals and that it would not just invest in any asset to meet renewable targets. In a sign of the escalating pressure on the sector, major institutional investors have threatened to ditch their stakes in oil and gas companies altogether unless they do more to combat climate change.
Pouyanné, who has spent more than two decades at Total and took over just days after the death of his predecessor Christophe de Margerie in a plane crash in 2014, admitted public sentiment had shifted faster than anyone in the industry imagined just a few years ago.
But the 57-year-old decried as a ""paradox"" the view that ""we will solve the climate change challenge just because there is no more equity invested in oil and gas majors, that's something completely wrong.""
""Even if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,"" added Pouyanné, arguing that selling assets to other producers who may be less mindful does little to help.
State-owned oil companies, including the likes of Saudi Aramco or the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., ""are not prepared to stop producing"" and if Total cuts back then ""Russian companies say, 'all that is quite good for us'because they will get the asset"".
Although the pandemic left Total with a loss of US$7.2 billion last year as oil prices slumped, the group has plowed ahead with its net-zero plan.
Despite Pouyanné's unease over valuations, renewables, chiefly solar and wind, are a big part of the group's future. While Total and BP are prioritizing low-carbon power generation, Shell is focusing on selling electricity instead. The French group has said it would spend more than US$2 billion this year on electricity and clean energy, seeking 10-per-cent returns on the investments.
It aims to generate more than US$1.5 billion in free cash flow from its renewables operations in 2025, up from about US$100 million pre-pandemic in 2019. However, this is still a fraction of the US$27 billion in free cash it generated that year, largely from its traditional businesses.
The group last month paid US$2.5 billion for a 20-per-cent stake in Adani Green Energy, deepening its presence in India. It has also bought solar and energy projects in Texas, and with Engie is developing the largest site in France for the production of green hydrogen.
The Adani investment ""will probably be the only (big) deal we can do"" this year, Pouyanné said, adding that Total would focus on smaller deals.
The Normandy-born chief executive runs Total with a firm grip, both managing day-to-day operations and stitching together some of its biggest deals with little help from bankers or his top executives - such as the US$7.5-billion acquisition of mostly North Sea oil assets from Denmark's Maersk in 2017.
The former rugby player went to the École Polytechnique and then the École des Mines in Paris, a top engineering school, making him what the French refer to as one of the ""X-Mines"" who have a large role in running the country's industrial base.
Pouyanné is unapologetic about the need to develop Total's fossil fuel businesses to help generate the cash for green investments. The group expects its oil production to remain stable, but its gas business is growing. The US$1.5-billion acquisition of liquefied natural gas assets from Engie in 2017 catapulted Total to No. 2 in the global market behind Shell.
Unlike BP, which plans to shrink its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent, Pouyanné is warier about diluting the group's traditional business. ""If you lose part of your source of cash and you are not able to finance your development, then you have an imbalance,"" he said. Even as oil prices crumbled last year, Total, which has 100,000 employees spanning more than 130 countries, was the only European oil major to keep its dividend intact. Its stock tumbled 29 per cent last year, but fared better than many peers.
""If an oil and gas major is not able to go through cycles, I don't know what we are able to offer our investors,"" said Pouyanné.
Total had a stronger balance sheet and lower debt levels than its peers before the pandemic hit ""which put less pressure on executives to do something about the dividend,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
""Still, it has not gone unscathed through each downturn. Equity investors have been diluted on multiple occasions, including from issuing discounted shares and hybrid bonds,"" he added.
In a period of both promise and peril for oil supermajors, Total has dismissed the suggestion by bankers of splitting off its renewables arm as a separate listed company, believing its clean energy business will still need the financial firepower currently provided by fossil fuels.
While a firm believer in renewables, the Total chief said the narrative over the shift to greener energy needs more nuance, pointing to the lack of debate among politicians and environmentalists over how much it will cost consumers.
""We have to face the reality that there is something wrong in the political debate,"" said Pouyanné. ""People think it's renewable so it should be free."""

| Jump to first hitRenewable energy assets are in a bubble that has led to a string of deals with ""crazy"" valuations, according to the chief executive of Total SE, one of the world's biggest oil and gas companies.
The warning from Patrick Pouyanné comes as the industry's heavyweights are caught between sustaining fossil fuel-based businesses that generate the bulk of both their profits and the cash for dividends, while facing louder calls to increase investment in clean energy.
Total is no exception. In a wide-ranging interview, Pouyanné said he wants the group to be recognized not ""as an oil and gas company, but as an energy company.""
The Paris-based multinational has pledged billions in renewables investment, targeted net-zero emissions by 2050 and proposed renaming the company TotalEnergies, which its shareholders will vote on in May.
However, ""there is a bubble"" in the renewables sector, Pouyanné cautioned. Valuations that are often up to 25 times earnings are ""just crazy today,"" the Total chief added, putting that down to the short supply of assets of a significant scale. They are ""too scarce.""
Total was one of several major oil companies, BP PLC among them, that earlier this month paid what one analyst described as ""staggering"" prices for the leases to U.K. offshore wind projects.
In a thinly veiled swipe at BP, which was part of the highest-bidding consortium, he said: ""When we come, we don't pay too much.""
With European oil and gas companies under particular pressure to steer their portfolios toward cleaner forms of energy, Pouyanné is not shocked at the frenzy over renewables as sellers seek out the deepest pockets.
""I will not buy, but I think I would not be surprised to see one of my European peers spending money,"" he said. ""A banker came to me (about another deal) and said 'If you don't buy it, BP will buy it'. I said, OK, but at this price, why should I buy that? Explain it to me.""
BP's Dev Sanyal, who is responsible for its alternative energy business, said last week that value is the ""key driver"" when the group does deals and that it would not just invest in any asset to meet renewable targets. In a sign of the escalating pressure on the sector, major institutional investors have threatened to ditch their stakes in oil and gas companies altogether unless they do more to combat climate change.
Pouyanné, who has spent more than two decades at Total and took over just days after the death of his predecessor Christophe de Margerie in a plane crash in 2014, admitted public sentiment had shifted faster than anyone in the industry imagined just a few years ago.
But the 57-year-old decried as a ""paradox"" the view that ""we will solve the climate change challenge just because there is no more equity invested in oil and gas majors, that's something completely wrong.""
""Even if BP, Total and Shell divest from oil and gas it does not change anything,"" added Pouyanné, arguing that selling assets to other producers who may be less mindful does little to help.
State-owned oil companies, including the likes of Saudi Aramco or the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., ""are not prepared to stop producing"" and if Total cuts back then ""Russian companies say, 'all that is quite good for us'because they will get the asset"".
Although the pandemic left Total with a loss of US$7.2 billion last year as oil prices slumped, the group has plowed ahead with its net-zero plan.
Despite Pouyanné's unease over valuations, renewables, chiefly solar and wind, are a big part of the group's future. While Total and BP are prioritizing low-carbon power generation, Shell is focusing on selling electricity instead. The French group has said it would spend more than US$2 billion this year on electricity and clean energy, seeking 10-per-cent returns on the investments.
It aims to generate more than US$1.5 billion in free cash flow from its renewables operations in 2025, up from about US$100 million pre-pandemic in 2019. However, this is still a fraction of the US$27 billion in free cash it generated that year, largely from its traditional businesses.
The group last month paid US$2.5 billion for a 20-per-cent stake in Adani Green Energy, deepening its presence in India. It has also bought solar and energy projects in Texas, and with Engie is developing the largest site in France for the production of green hydrogen.
The Adani investment ""will probably be the only (big) deal we can do"" this year, Pouyanné said, adding that Total would focus on smaller deals.
The Normandy-born chief executive runs Total with a firm grip, both managing day-to-day operations and stitching together some of its biggest deals with little help from bankers or his top executives - such as the US$7.5-billion acquisition of mostly North Sea oil assets from Denmark's Maersk in 2017.
The former rugby player went to the École Polytechnique and then the École des Mines in Paris, a top engineering school, making him what the French refer to as one of the ""X-Mines"" who have a large role in running the country's industrial base.
Pouyanné is unapologetic about the need to develop Total's fossil fuel businesses to help generate the cash for green investments. The group expects its oil production to remain stable, but its gas business is growing. The US$1.5-billion acquisition of liquefied natural gas assets from Engie in 2017 catapulted Total to No. 2 in the global market behind Shell.
Unlike BP, which plans to shrink its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent, Pouyanné is warier about diluting the group's traditional business. ""If you lose part of your source of cash and you are not able to finance your development, then you have an imbalance,"" he said. Even as oil prices crumbled last year, Total, which has 100,000 employees spanning more than 130 countries, was the only European oil major to keep its dividend intact.

LONDON -- French energy giant Total SE said it would pay $2.5 billion for a 20% stake in the world's largest solar developer, the latest move by an oil major to expand in renewable power.
Total said Monday the investment in Adani Green Energy Ltd. would help it meet its targets for generating more power from low-carbon sources amid a continuing global transition away from fossil fuels -- a shift some analysts say is being accelerated by the pandemic.
The company, along with other major oil companies including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, has pledged to increase spending on renewable energy such as wind and solar power to reduce carbon emissions. Total plans to spend $3 billion a year on renewables by 2030, around 20% of its annual investment budget and up from $2 billion last year.
The Adani deal gives Total exposure to a leading renewables business in India, one of the world's fastest-growing markets for energy demand. Adani has 54 wind and solar projects in operation across the country, including one of the world's largest solar projects in Kamuthi, Southern India. Based on existing generating capacity and the projects in its pipeline, Adani is the world's largest developer of solar power, Total said.
As part of the deal, Total is taking a 50% stake in a portfolio of Adani's solar assets and getting a seat on its board. The move will help Total toward its goal of having 35 gigawatts of renewable power capacity by 2025, up from around 7 gigawatts last year.
""Given the size of the market, India is the right place to put into action our energy transition strategy based on two pillars: renewables and natural gas,"" said Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne.
Total and Adani Group, one of India's largest infrastructure conglomerates, have previously made other joint investments, including in liquefied natural gas.
Major oil companies boosted their activities in renewable energy in recent years, anticipating demand for oil will decline as more of the global economy becomes electrified. New technologies such as electric vehicles are expected to increase demand for electricity, while denting requirements for oil-based transport fuels.
Monday's deal isn't the first time Total invested in solar. In 2011, the company bought a majority stake in U.S. solar panel manufacturer SunPower Corp. However, following several years of losses, SunPower spun off its panel-making business in August to focus on solar-panel installations. Total remains a shareholder in both SunPower and the new Singapore-based company Maxeon Solar Technologies Ltd.

French energy major Total SE on Monday announced acquisition of minority stake — 20 per cent — in Adani Group’s renewable energy arm, Adani Green Energy Limited (AGEL).
Following the stake-buy, Total will have a seat on the board of directors of the company.
As per the transaction, Total acquired the shares held by the Adani Promoter Group in AGEL. “The transaction marks the deepening partnership between the Adani Group – India’s leading infrastructure platform — and Total, in the transition and green energy fields in India,” a Total statement said.
The partnership with AGEL in the renewables space in India will be a key contributor to Total’s objective of reaching 35 GWp (gigawatts peak) of gross production capacity from renewable sources by 2025 and adding 10 GWp per year afterwards, it added.
Speaking on the occasion, Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of Total, said, “This agreement is an important step in our alliance with the Adani Group in India and our common vision and goals with respect to the importance of access to low carbon energy in India. Our entry into AGEL is a major milestone in our strategy in the renewable energy business in India. Given the size of the market, India is the right place to put into action our energy transition strategy based on two pillars: renewables and natural gas.”
In a statement, Adani Group Chairman, Gautam Adani, said, “We are delighted to deepen our strategic alliance with TOTAL, a global energy major, and welcome them as a significant shareholder in Adani Green Energy Limited. We have a shared vision of developing renewable power at affordable prices to enable a sustainable energy transformation in India. We look forward to working together towards delivering India’s vision for 450 GW renewable energy by 2030.”
Notably, in 2018, Total and Adani partnered with an investment by Total in Adani Gas Limited, Adani Group’s city gas distribution business, associated LNG terminal business and gas marketing business.
Renewable energy space
During the development of this partnership, it was further agreed that Total and Adani shall continue this alliance into the wider renewable energy space, Total said.
Total and Adani agreed the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in a 2.35 GWac portfolio of operating solar assets owned by AGEL and a 20 per cent stake in AGEL for a global investment of $2.5 billion, Total stated.
Total was represented by Latham & Watkins and AZB Partners, while the Adani Promoter Group was represented by Clifford Chance and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas.
Started in 2015 AGEL has now ranked as the Top global solar power generation asset developer by Mercom Capital. As on date, AGEL has over 14.6 GW of contracted renewable capacity, with an operating capacity of 3 GW and another 3 GW under construction and 8.6 GW under development."

The pandemic has triggered the largest revision to the value of the oil industry's assets in at least a decade, as companies sour on costly projects amid the prospect of low prices for years.
Oil-and-gas companies in North America and Europe wrote down roughly $145 billion combined in the first three quarters of 2020, the most for that nine-month period since at least 2010, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. That total significantly surpassed write-downs taken over the same periods in 2015 and 2016, during the last oil bust, and is equivalent to roughly 10% of the companies' collective market value.
Companies across the major Western economies are writing down more of their assets during the coronavirus pandemic than they have in years. But the oil industry has written down more than any other major segment of the economy, following an unprecedented collapse in global energy demand, according to an analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Oil producers frequently write down assets when commodity prices crash, as cash flows from oil-and-gas properties diminish. This year's industrywide reappraisal is among its starkest ever because oil companies also face longer-term uncertainty for their main products amid the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and concern about the lasting impact of climate change.
European major oil companies Royal Dutch Shell PLC, BP PLC and Total SE were among the most aggressive cutters, accounting for more than one-third of the industry's write-downs this year. U.S. shale producers including Concho Resources Inc. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. booked more impairments than they had in the past four years combined. The data, which encompassed the first three quarters of 2020, excluded Exxon Mobil Corp.'s recently announced plan to write down up to $20 billion in the fourth quarter and the $10 billion Chevron Corp. slashed in late 2019.
The Journal's analysis reviewed data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Evaluate Energy Ltd. and IHS Markit on impairments taken by major oil companies and independent oil producers with a market value of more than $1 billion based in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
Regina Mayor, who leads KPMG's energy practice, said the write-downs represent not only the diminished short-term value of the assets but many companies' belief that oil prices may never fully recover.
""They are coming to grips with the fact that demand for the product will decline, and the write-downs are a harbinger of that,"" Ms. Mayor said.
U.S. accounting rules require companies to write down an asset when its projected cash flows fall below its current book value. Though an impairment doesn't affect a company's cash flow, it can potentially raise its borrowing costs by increasing its debt load relative to its assets. Companies are also required to record impairments as earnings charges.
For the oil industry, the reassessment comes at the end of an era in which a perceived scarcity of energy supplies drove a rush to buy up fossil-fuel reserves, including U.S. shale deposits and Canadian oil sands. Some of the assets require higher oil prices that were prevalent earlier in the decade to be profitable. But after U.S. frackers unleashed vast sums of oil and gas, there have been two oil busts in the past five years, and Brent oil, the global benchmark, last topped $100 a barrel in 2014.
Concerns about long-term demand are exacerbating the oversupply of fossil fuels, and companies say they have become more selective about where they invest. Projects are facing much stiffer competition for capital amid ample supplies. BP, Shell and Chevron cited internal forecasts for lower commodity prices as the cause of the impairments.
The types of assets the companies are writing down run the gamut from U.S. shale-gas properties to mega-offshore projects, and intangible assets.
Shell said its write-downs mainly related to its Queensland Curtis liquefied-natural-gas project in Australia and its giant floating gas facility, Prelude, which has struggled to deliver income.
In coming years, heightened competition from renewable energy and policy changes could trigger further reviews of oil-and-gas assets' ability to generate future cash flows under U.S. accounting rules, said Philip Keejae Hong, an accounting professor at Central Michigan University.
""It's not like one company [is] making a bad move,"" Mr. Hong said. ""It's a threat that the industry as a whole is facing in the long run.""

Total SA pledged to ramp up its spending on renewable energy and reduce its dependence on petroleum, the latest move by a major oil company toward cleaner power.
The French company said Wednesday that it plans to spend $3 billion a year on renewables by 2030, about 20% of its annual investment budget and up from $2 billion this year. Over the same period, it said it also plans to reduce its sales of oil products such as gasoline and diesel by 30%, while increasing its sales of natural gas, electricity and biofuels.
Overall, Total said its energy production was set to grow by a third in the coming decade. Of that, roughly half would come from liquefied natural gas and the other half from electricity—mostly from growth in solar and wind power.
""We are also convinced that this is the right direction,"" Chief Executive Patrick Poyanne told investors at an event detailing the company's plans.
However, he also said Total would remain committed to its core oil and gas business. ""We consider that maintaining an oil and gas business is a foundation of the transformation, because it will provide to us the cash flow that we need.""
The move comes as Total expects oil demand to peak by 2030 as demand for electricity and LNG rises.
Total's green investment plans are similar to those outlined by rival BP PLC earlier this year, although on a slower time frame.
BP intends to increase its low-carbon investments to 20% of its budget by 2025 and cut its oil-and-gas output by 40% in the coming decade. The British company has also said it plans to increase renewable-power output. 
Major oil companies have said that the coronavirus pandemic could speed up the transition from fossil fuels toward low-carbon energy, which has been under way for several years amid concern about global warming. The pandemic has sapped demand for oil, hitting prices and corporate profits.
In response, these companies have cut their workforces , written down the value of their assets and, in the case of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP, cut dividends.
Total has resisted taking some of these measures. On Wednesday, Mr. Pouyanne said the company intended to maintain its dividend and didn't plan to lay off staff.
Mr. Poyanne said he hoped the shift into renewables would boost the company's valuation, and that its dividend would help differentiate Total from other majors making the move. Oil stocks have fallen out of favor in recent years, while renewable energy companies have fared better.
However, some investors say they're concerned that oil companies might damage profits by moving into areas like wind and solar because they lack experience, competition is rising and returns are typically lower. Total said it expects its renewable-energy projects to generate returns of 10%, below its target of 15% given last year. The industry benchmark for returns on oil and gas projects is around 15%.
Oil companies have struggled to attract investors amid uncertainty over the speed and timing of the transition to low-carbon energy. The pandemic has exacerbated that slump, with shares in the world's oil majors taking a beating this year.
However, Total's stock price has fared better than its peers, down about 14% over the past three months, compared with drops of over 20% for other majors.

Fighting between Islamic extremist rebels and Mozambique's army over a key port is threatening to disrupt the East African nation's burgeoning natural-gas developments, including a multibillion-dollar project led by French energy giant Total SA.
The insurgent group, which is affiliated with Islamic State, seized control of the Mocimboa da Praia port this month and government troops have moved into the area on Mozambique's northern coast on the Indian Ocean to mount an effort to regain control of the site.
The seizure of the port has interrupted the transit of oil and gas equipment through the port, a person close to the Mozambican government said. Much of Mocimboa's infrastructure has been vandalized, he said.
This person said the rebels had sunk a security forces reconnaissance vessel and that as of Thursday, the Islamic State franchise was fighting the Mozambican military from within the port.
The rebel group, which stepped up attacks in the northern part of the country last year, infiltrated several neighborhoods in Mocimboa da Praia, with the help of local accomplices, he said.
The rising threat to Mozambique's gas fields underscores the expansion of the radical Islamic State in new territories following the loss of its strongholds in Syria and Iraq two years ago. It also reflects the inability of the security forces to stop militants from taking over key infrastructure in regions of Africa where ISIS is now expanding .
""ISIS was more organized and better equipped than the army,"" said Lorino Machava, who lives in Mocimboa and is a dockworker at the port. ""I could hear officers screaming that they were out of ammunition and petrol. The soldiers ran away.""
The Mocimboa da Praia port has been a logistics link for Total's $23 billion natural-gas project, located 37 miles north. A month before the attack Total had secured $14.9 billion in senior debt financing for the project.
""Two weeks ago it was full steam ahead, but now it's let's wait and see,"" said a Japanese shipping executive involved in talks to build some 16 new liquefied natural gas carriers worth around $2.9 billion to move the LNG. ""We were supposed to arrange the ship charters this month so we can order the vessels, but after the port seizure there is numbness. We don't know what's going to happen.""
Aderito Manjate, a truck driver who moves supplies for gas companies in the region, said the rebels have been ""setting up camp in and around the port. There are no ships coming in and there are still fire fights. It's very dangerous.""
Data from Marine Traffic, a Greece-based vessel-tracking service, show no ships moving in and out of the port since late July, while other ports in the region including Maputo, Beira and Nacala to the south, appear to be operating normally.
""We have a robust security protocol in place with the authorities to ensure the security of the workforce and the operations,"" Total said in an emailed statement.
The Total facility in Mozambique's northern Cabo Delgado province involves the development of the Golfinho and Atum offshore natural-gas fields.
The project is one of three major energy developments planned in the country that have drawn significant foreign backing in recent years. Overall foreign investment in Mozambique's gas sector has soared since a large gas discovery in 2010, and is estimated by energy executives at around $60 billion, four times the country's $15 billion economic output last year.
The Total liquefaction project has been in the works for years under different owners. Total now controls a 26.5% slice and local energy firm Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 holds 20%, with the rest split among other investors.
The project is expected to produce around 13 million metric tons of liquefied natural gas a year after completion in 2023, with European and Asian buyers already lined up for the output. It is on the Afungi Peninsula and depends on the Mocimboa da Praia port for the import of some building supplies and heavy equipment.
Apart from Total, Italy's Eni SpA is leading a consortium building a separate $8 billion offshore project called Coral South.
""Eni is carefully monitoring the development of the situation and it keeps an active dialogue with the government of Mozambique,"" said a company spokesman.
Exxon Mobil Corp. has delayed work on its Rovuma LNG facility in northern Mozambique.
An Exxon spokesman said the company is working with the government to protect its workers and facilities but gave no timeline on when work will resume.
The Total site is being protected by private security contractors. Armored vehicles patrol a double-fenced perimeter, with snipers posted on high structures overlooking the facility. A ship terminal has been built for small vessels to dock.
""The strategy is to create a secure enclave. They have an airstrip, a port and staff living quarters,"" said Alexandre Raymakers, senior Africa analyst at U.K.-based consulting firm Verisk Maplecroft. ""The ultimate concern is ISIS-linked fighters going on a full frontal land and sea assault on the peninsula and taking over the site and taking hostages. That is the worst-case scenario.""
It's the third time in the past 12 months that ISIS fighters have seized Mocimboa da Praia, with the army taking it back after intense fighting. Some 1,000 civilians in the country have been killed since 2017 when the ISIS attacks began and more than 200,000 have been displaced, according to the United Nations.

| Jump to first hitMUMBAI, Aug. 6 -- The Adani Gas and French energy major Total SA will soon seek government nod to open retail fuel stations in India, said the former's chief executive officer, Suresh Manglani, on Wednesday.""Definitely we will take full benefit of the expertise and strength of Total,"" Manglani had told reporters on an earnings call, adding that the intent was to become a full-service operator providing a multi-fuel offering.The joint venture, Total Adani Fuels Marketing Pvt Ltd, will shortly apply for a licence under the new liberal fuel retailing rules, Manglani said.Last October, Total SA had agreed to acquire a 37.4% stake in city gas distributor Adani Gas Ltd for around Rs.5,700 crore - marking the French energy major's biggest bet on India's clean energy push.The proposed acquisition also marked the largest foreign direct investment in India's city gas distribution industry, with the deal giving Total joint control of Adani Gas, along with the Adani group.Despite a slowing economy, India remains a lucrative market for global oil companies as it is the world's third largest oil consumer and importer.In October, the government had eased fuel retailing norms, allowing non-oil companies to set up petrol pumps to boost competition. This June, the government also allowed entities to set up liquefied natural gas (LNG) stations anywhere in the country as India aims to raise share of gas in its energy mix to 15% by 2030 from the current 6.2%These measures, say analysts, has made India an attractive destination for oil majors.Last month, British oil major BP and India's Reliance Industries (RIL) formalised their joint venture Reliance BP Mobility Ltd.RBML, where BP holds 49% stake and RIL holds the rest, plans to expand fuel retail outlets to over 5,500 from the present over-1,400. It also plans to build full-stack electrolyzer and fuel cell solutions in India which will be used to run hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. ""We will replace transportation fuels with clean electricity and hydrogen,"" RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had said at the company's annual general meeting on 15 July.Adani Gas, which has been a major player in the country's city gas distribution segment, also plans to sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transportation.The company on Wednesday reported a 42% year-on-year decline in its net profit for the quarter ended June to Rs.46 crore.Revenue from operations dropped 57% to Rs.207 crore from Rs.479 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) was down 41% at Rs.86 crore.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT."

| Jump to first hitAdani Gas has inducted on its board partner Total SA's India renewable energy and power head, second representative of the French energy major on the board, as two companies work towards a plan to offer a bigger portfolio. Earlier this year, Total acquired 37.4% stake in Adani Gas to jointly expand downstream energy business in India. On Wednesday, Adani Gas said that Jose Ignacio Sanz Saiz, vice president at Total India for gas, renewables and power, will be on the board of the company. Prior to this, Total SA's India head Alexis Thelemaque was inducted on the board.
""Currently we are focusing on CNG development. But a separate company, Total-Adani Fuel Retail, which will come into fuel retailing in future. That plan is being developed. We will be offering multi-fuel to customers,"" Adani Gas Chief Executive Officer Suresh Manglani said. The Gautam Adani-led utility firm sells piped natural gas (PNG) to households and compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles and aims to diversify into retail sales of other fuels through this joint venture.
Separately, on Wednesday, the company reported consolidated net profit of Rs 39 crore in the first quarter of 2020-21, plummeting to half of its Rs 79 crore profit in the quarter a year ago. Consolidated total income in the quarter declined to Rs 215 crore as against Rs Rs 490 crore. The company attributed the decline to the volume falling by over 50% in the June quarter due to nationwide lockdown amidst Covid-19 lockdown. The company said that there has been a progressive rebound in volumes, which have inched up to 1.25 mscmd as on end-June as compared to 1.60 mscmd for the month of March. The operational performance of the business continues to be recovering in a phased manner towards pre-COVID level."

| Jump to first hitThe secretive oil-trading businesses of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SE saved both European majors from posting losses in the second quarter, bringing a torrent of cash that countered the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
Investors had already been warned that the pandemic hammered almost all parts of the energy giants'businesses - from forecourts, to oil and gas production, to the long-term value of assets. But that was offset by gains from speculating on energy markets, the companies said Thursday.
In keeping with tradition, Shell and Total didn't disclose exactly how much money their trading operations made, but acknowledged they were able to exploit extreme price volatility during April's record supply glut.
The quarter was ""the best on record"" for Shell's trading unit, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said on a call with reporters. ""It was a really outstanding performance.""
When asked by investors on a separate call about how much money the traders made, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne responded: ""The oil trading is a secret."" He would only say it made about $500 million more than usual, but refused to disclose what's the normal baseline.
Shell took advantage of its sprawling infrastructure that allowed it to capitalize on the market's volatility - from storing oil cheaply to adapting its refineries to meet changes in demand. Shell benefited from ""all sorts of arbitrages that opened up in unusual parts of the world,"" chief executive Ben van Beurden said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
With trading floors that resemble the operations of Wall Street banks in cities from London to Singapore, the European majors have an edge over their main American rivals, which market their own energy production but largely eschew pure trading as a means of generating profits. That means that Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., which publish results on Friday, are unlikely to report a similar boost in the second quarter.
Shell's adjusted net income was $638 million in the second quarter, down 82% from the same period a year earlier but far better than the average analyst estimate of a $664 million loss.
Total posted a surprise profit of $126 million, compared with expectations for a loss of $443 million.
Those figures exclude tens of billions of dollars of writedowns on the value of the companies'assets resulting from the slump in oil and gas prices, which had already been disclosed to investors.
Shell's B shares fell 5.7 per cent to 1,113.8 pence as of 4:55 p.m. in London. Total fell 1.6 per cent to 31.93 euros in Paris.
When oil prices plunged last quarter, traders were able to buy crude on the cheap, store it and lock in a profit from the future sale by selling forward in the derivatives market. The profit was possible because spot prices were much lower than forward prices, a situation known as contango.
With its vast access to data from its shipping network, its refining positions and high flow of trades, Shell was able to capitalize on the market structure more extensively than the average trader, finding contango plays in more obscure non-benchmark crudes.
""We do contango on steroids,"" Van Beurden said.
It's unlikely that profits from trading will remain at the same level during the rest of the year, since the contango has since diminished significantly and market volatility has eased.
Shell's ""very strong trading and optimization performance that we saw in the second quarter is not necessarily an indication for the third quarter,"" CFO Uhl said. While she wouldn't disclose how much money the company's traders made, there were some clues in its statement.
Shell's entire refining and trading business delivered adjusted net income of $1.5 billion in the period, more than 20 times larger than a year earlier. Considering that the part of Shell's business that actually manufactures fuel suffered one of its worstever quarters, with low margins and sales volumes, it's possible that the bulk of those earnings came from trading.
Last week, Norway's Equinor ASA said its trading division made a record $1 billion gain in the second quarter. British oil giant BP PLC, which runs a large trading business similar to those at Shell and Total, is also likely to report gains from that unit when it announces results next Tuesday.
""Trading platforms always deliver a positive surprise in terrible macro conditions,"" said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Sanford C Bernstein Ltd.
Those conditions prompted dismal results in most other areas of the companies' operations. And not every producer was able to avoid the expected loss. Italian oil giant Eni SpA, which also published earnings on Thursday, lost 714 million euros ($839 million) and announced a dividend cut."

| Jump to first hitThe nation's embattled liquefied natural gas industry has been hit by more large write-downs, as French energy major Total SA adds $US800 million ($1.1 billion) of impairments on its Australian assets to about $US7 billion already announced across the sector.
Total, which owns big stakes in both Inpex Corporation's $US45 billion Ichthys LNG project in Darwin and Santos' GLNG venture in Queensland, did not give a breakdown of the Australian write-downs, which come after the group cut its assumptions for future oil prices and are part of $US8 billion of impairments across its global portfolio.
But it said the issue of ""giant projects with high construction costs"" was behind the impairments on the Australian assets and $US1.5 billion of write-downs on Canadian oil sands assets, combined with the lower expectations for oil prices. It took an extra $US5.5 billion of impairments on two oil sands assets in Canada that it expects will not be produced by 2050, the French player's target for becoming carbon neutral.
The move adds to the wave of write-downs that has swept across Australia's LNG sector in recent weeks, involving local players Woodside Petroleum, Santos and Origin Energy as well as internationals such as Shell, ENI and BP. The tally may increase further, with major players such as Chevron and Japan's Inpex yet to announce any similar move.
While several of the write-downs are specifically related to projects that ran over budget and have technical problems - such as Shell's floating Prelude LNG - they have also raised doubts whether the economic case for the more than $200 billion invested in new LNG supply here will bear out.
Write-downs flagged by Santos last week of up to $US800 million were mostly due to a fourth impairment on the GLNG venture in Queensland, in which it has 30 per cent, while Total holds 27.5 per cent. Total also owns 26 per cent of Ichthys, after having sold 4 per cent back to venture operator Inpex in 2018, citing disappointment in cost blowouts and construction delays.
Still, Total's write-downs in Australian LNG are modest compared with the massive reductions in valuations of its Canadian oil sands interests that have a longer-term development schedule. The oil price revisions behind the reduced valuations involve an assumption of a price of $US50 a barrel for Brent oil in 2050, which Total said is in line with the ""well below two degrees C"" scenario. It is assuming Brent oil will average $US35 a barrel this year, rising to $US40 in 2021 and further to $US60 in 2023.
""Gas prices have been adjusted accordingly,"" it added.
For the longer term, Total said it expects the low level of investment in oil and gas since 2015, accentuated by the COVID-19 crisis, to result in a rebound in prices by 2025 due to insufficient production capacity. But beyond 2030 it anticipates oil demand will have reached its peak and that Brent prices should tend towards a long-term price of $US50.
Meanwhile, the likelihood of low-cost Qatar moving ahead with a huge LNG expansion in the next six months looks set to put further competitive pressures on new projects in Australia, such as Woodside's Browse plans. Qatar is expected to decide in early 2021 on a 49 million tonnes a year expansion of its North field, capturing more than a third of the expected additional LNG capacity required by 2030, according to Bernstein Research.
""Assuming Qatar's expansion goes ahead, then there is limited scope for others,"" said Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge. The firm expects Woodside's Scarborough project to proceed, as well as an expansion in Papua New Guinea and some other projects, but said that ""marginal projects that are higher cost"" such as Browse and others may face long delays.
Qatar's expansion would propel the country back into the ranking of the world's largest LNG exporter.

Adani Green Energy has won India’s largest manufacturing-linked solar power agreement, awarded to date by SECI, to set up a 8,000 megawatt or 8 gigawatt (GW) solar power generation capacity, and 2,000 megawatt or 2GW solar cell and panel manufacturing capacity in the next five years. The projects will entail an investment of Rs 45,000 crore ($6 billion) and create job opportunities for over 4 lakh people.The cell manufacturing capacity of 2GW will be over and above the existing 1.3GW that Adani Solar currently manufactures. According to people in the know, French energy major Total SA that invested around Rs 3,707 crore in April to form an equal joint venture for operating solar power assets of Adani Green, is likely to invest in the project.“Total SA investing in the project may be a logical progression for a company that is looking to become carbon neutral. We are also in talks with other companies, who are willing to invest,” said a senior company official. “The promoters also have the option of diluting the stake in the company, where they hold over 75%, to raise the capital for the project,” the official added.According to an analyst with a foreign brokerage firm, raising funds will be challenging for Adani Green, which will have to find cheap funds from foreign markets to make a decent return on a risk-free SECI-awarded project. The company will get Rs 2.92/Mwh under the power purchase agreement with SECI.As on March 31, Adani Green’s gross debt was at Rs 13,943 crore (excluding inter corporate deposits and lease liability) and net debt was Rs 11,470 crore. According to the award agreement, the 8,000 MW of solar development projects will be implemented over the next five years. The first 2000 MW capacity will come online by 2022 and the subsequent 6000 MW capacity will be added in annual increments of 2000 MW through 2025, the company said.“The projects will include a variety of locations, including a 2000 MW single-site generation project that is tied for the rank of the largest single-site project announced globally,” Adani Green said. The solar cell and module manufacturing capacity of 2,000 MW will be established by 2022 and, along with the existing 1,300 MW of capacity, it will further consolidate the group’s position as India’s largest solar manufacturing facility, the company said."

French oil major Total SA said Tuesday it aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 after engaging with a group of institutional investors with more than $40 trillion in assets.
The move comes as the oil-and-gas sector faces pressure from investors to tackle climate change and shift away from hydrocarbons amid a historic meltdown in oil prices. Fossil-fuel companies in Europe are also looking to align their strategies with the European Union's ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050, as governments ready regulations to punish big polluters.
Total said it aims to achieve net-zero emissions from its operations world-wide and from the energy products it sells in Europe by 2050. The company is also targeting a 60% reduction in the carbon intensity of its products to less than 27.5 grams of carbon dioxide per megajoule.
""Energy markets are changing, driven by climate change, technology and societal expectations,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanné said. ""As the EU has set the target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and thereby lead the way for other regions to become carbon neutral over time, Total takes that commitment to become neutral for all its businesses in Europe.""
The company also said it would assess its oil-and-gas capital spending allocation to make sure it is consistent with the Paris Agreement and will advocate for policies that support achieving net-zero emissions.
Climate Action 100+, the group of investors behind the engagement, welcomed Total's announcement, which it said follows many years of dialogue with the company.
""This agreement is one of the most significant achievements in the oil-and-gas industry so far,"" said Helena Vines Fiestas, global head of stewardship and policy at BNP Paribas Asset Management. ""The global energy system is under significant structural pressure from long-term forces such as decarbonization and the deflationary impact of renewables... Total's commitment shows that it understands the scale of this challenge.""
Total's pledge is the latest in a series of commitments made by European oil majors.
In April, Royal Dutch Shell PLC set more ambitious emissions goals, including reducing the carbon footprint of the fuel it sells by 30% by 2035 and 65% by 2050.
In March, British oil-and-gas company BP PLC agreed to draft a shareholder resolution to be voted on next year that would enshrine its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.
Norwegian energy major Equinor ASA in February announced new climate goals, including reaching carbon neutrality from its operations by 2030, boosting renewable energy 10-fold by 2026 and cutting its carbon intensity by at least half by 2050.

French energy giant Total SA will immediately cut expenditures, trim returns to shareholders and freeze recruitment as the company combats the ravages of an oil-price rout and a demand-sapping coronavirus pandemic, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne told staffers last week in a video message seen by The Wall Street Journal.
The austerity measures at the fourth largest Western oil company will amount to about $5 billion, Mr. Pouyanne said. Total also plans to borrow $4 billion to make up for an expected $9 billion shortfall created by lower oil prices.
The shortfall is roughly equivalent to the amount Total spends on dividend payments to shareholders, Mr. Pouyanne pointed out in the video.
The company declined to comment.
Oil companies are reeling after a double whammy from the coronavirus hitting global demand for crude while a Saudi-Russian price war creates excess supply. Oil prices have fallen by more than half since the beginning of the year to below $30 a barrel. Total's share price has halved since the start of the year, in line with other major oil companies.
Earlier this month, Houston-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. slashed its spending by a third and
cut its quarterly dividend
, while Italy's ENI SpA also cut spending and suspended its share buyback program.
Speaking via a video broadcast to staff on Thursday, Mr. Pouyanne said the actions were necessary given that oil demand is likely to fall by 6 million barrels a day—or 6%—in April. Combined with an expected increase in production from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members, there would be an excess of oil supply in a lower demand market, he said.
The company has set up a ""crisis cell"" headed by Denis Favier, Senior Vice President, Security, and its executive committee have been communicating digitally, Paris-based Mr. Pouyanne said on the video.
Total is one of France's largest private employers. The country has the seventh highest number of coronavirus cases globally as of Sunday, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. The French government has introduced strict measures to limit its population's movements.
Total's revised financial plan for 2020 is based on an oil price of $35 a barrel, down from its previous assumption of $60 a barrel, Mr. Pouyanne said. Benchmark Brent oil prices closed at $27.21 a barrel on Friday.
The company will focus its cuts on exploring for and producing oil and gas, where spending was reduced by $2.5 billion, while protecting the planned $1.5 billion to $2 billion investment in low-carbon electricity.
""I want us to continue developing digital and new energies, to safeguard our future,"" said Mr. Pouyanne.
Other investment cuts included $300 million in gas, renewables and power, $300 million in refining and chemicals and $200 million in marketing and services. The firm also doubled its ambitions to reduce operating costs by $800 million, instead of the previous goal of $400 million.
By halting this year's $2 billion share buyback program the company will save $1.5 billion.
Mr. Pouyanne reiterated Total's commitment to the transition to lower-carbon energy, saying the firm would now target reducing its emissions to 20 million tons by 2025, from a previous aim of 40 million tons. Total's carbon emissions from its operations were 46 million tons in 2015.
""The CO2 issue is not diminished by this focus on the short term,"" said Mr. Pouyanne.

Manglani said that the company is committed to expanding its city gas distribution business, which will get fillip once French energy major Total SA comes in as a partner.
""The primary process is completed and the secondary process has started. Total is working to ensure that all processes are completed and the secondary stake sale takes place. They have shown interest, they are keen to participate and we look forward to them coming full-fledged on board. Hopefully, it should happen by March or at the earliest possible time,"" Manglani said.
In October, Adani Gas announced that it had struck a pact under which Total SA would buy 37.5% stake in the company, including a public offer to shareholders to buy a further 25.2%; such that both partners eventually hold 37.4% each. They plan to invest in infrastructure and assets worth over US$1 billion, which span LNG infrastructure and marketing and fuel retail business.
On Wednesday, Adani Gas reported a 145% year-on-year increase in net profit to Rs 115.27 in the December quarter.

Iraq's hopes of rivaling Saudi Arabia for regional oil dominance, already hurt by a pullback in foreign investment, are facing new challenges from
escalating conflict
and threats of sanctions from President Trump, say oil executives and Iraqi officials.
Iraq was expected to be the third largest contributor to global oil-production growth in the decade up to 2030, behind the U.S. and Brazil, according to the International Energy Agency, but the U.S. airstrike last week that
killed Iranian Maj Gen. Qassem Suleimani
in Iraq has raised risks for foreign oil companies operating there.
""Iraq's success story is at risk,"" said Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at Canadian broker RBC.
Oil supplies about 92% of the Iraqi government's revenue. Over the past two decades, the country has more than doubled its oil production to 4.7 million barrels a day. The boom times came despite deep difficulties including the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and Islamic State's takeover of large parts of the country in 2014.
But after a handful of large deals with global-oil majors, foreign direct investment fell by half between 2012 and 2018 to $5 billion, according to the World Bank. Barriers to foreign investment include an opaque regulatory environment and security concerns.
The dwindling flow of foreign money into Iraq's oil industry could be catastrophic for Iraq's economy. Its budget deficit is set to reach 3.5% of the gross domestic product in 2020, compared to a surplus of 7.9% in 2018.
Iraq has enough oil underground to more than double its production and challenge Saudi Arabia as the region's top producer, said Robin Mills, chief executive of Dubai-based consulting firm Qamar Energy.
""But it's always been a question with Iraq of investment and logistics and export capacity… it's all this practical stuff to support production, not the size and quality of the reservoirs,"" he said.
In the last decade, Iraq has had ambitions to raise production to 9 million barrels a day, but it has scaled back the target. It is now aiming to raise its production by more than a third to 6.5 million barrels a day by 2022, according to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
Pro-Iranian militias have intensified rocket attacks on American bases in recent days, after
attacking U.S. diplomatic
and oil facilities. Mr. Trump warned Baghdad on Monday that Washington could retaliate with sanctions, following the Iraqi parliament's vote Sunday to expel U.S. troops in response to the U.S. strike.
""It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,"" the president said, referring to the U.S. ban on all Iranian oil exports and international banking with Iran. The restrictions, in place since May 2018, have hobbled Tehran's economy.
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. said they evacuated American staffers from their facilities in Iraq after U.S. officials told its citizens to leave the country on Friday. After a U.K. government advisory, London-based oil-services company Petrofac Ltd. stopped sending U.K. managers into the country, according to a person familiar with the matter. The company declined to comment.
Iraq will be able to maintain oil-production levels with local workers, analysts said. But the exodus of U.S. and European executives and engineers is likely to deprive the country of expertise needed to further develop its reserves.
Last week, demonstrations at the 90,000-barrels-a-day Nasiriyah oil field in the south brought operations to a temporary shutdown.
Even before the recent tensions, Iraq's business environment had been deteriorating. A rocket attack near an Exxon Mobil facility in May had already triggered the evacuation of some staff. A wave of anti-corruption protests in October led to the resignation of the government. The cabinet stayed on in a caretaker capacity after parliament failed to agree on a replacement, leading to a paralysis of decision-making in the oil sector.

Firm Identifies Contractor Whose Death in Iraq Set Off U.S-Iran Confrontation

Exxon Mobil's negotiations with the Iraqi government over a $50 billion project have stalled. The deal includes a water-injection project critical for maintaining oil output in southern Iraq, where Exxon and BP PLC are among the top producers. Iraq's southern fields need 1.5 barrels of water injected for every barrel of oil produced, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Exxon Mobil said it doesn't comment on commercial discussions.
Iraq's tendency toward rigid contract demands have also made the country unattractive. Contracts with the Iraqi government often yield foreign companies around $1 to $2 per barrel of oil, compared with around $14 a barrel in some parts of the world, said Qamar Energy's Mr. Mills. The global benchmark oil price is around $70 a barrel.
""In terms of the contract terms, it would be fair to say [Iraq is] probably the toughest in the world.""
In 2018, Royal Dutch Shell Plc exited the 240,000-barrels-a-day Majnoon oilfield in southern Iraq, partly due to tough contractual terms. Talks to replace Shell with Chevron or France's Total SA have yet to yield results.
Shell and Total SA declined to comment. Chevron said it doesn't discuss commercial matters.
Still, the International Energy Agency predicted last year Iraq would raise output by 25% to 6 million barrels a day by 2030, overtaking Canada as the world's fourth-largest producer. Amid years of underinvestment, however, an Iraqi oil official said he was unsure the expectation was realistic. ""Are we heading for a decline?"" he asked.

Apache Corp. and Total SA said that they have found ""significant"" deposits of oil off the coast of Suriname, fueling investor excitement that it could be the second big discovery in the region recently after a major strike in offshore Guyana by Exxon Mobil Corp.
News of the successful find sent shares of Houston-based Apache up more than 25% in Tuesday trading, putting it on pace for its largest stock gain since 1973. Total shares were down slightly.
The surge more than reversed a decline in Apache's share price in December, when the company released
a sparse progress report
that didn't detail whether it had found oil near the small South American country, raising more questions than answers.

Apache's announcement Tuesday was also short on details but indicated Apache had found oil in two of the areas it had been testing, erasing investor fears the project could be a bust.
""Data indicates the potential for prolific oil wells,"" Apache Chief Executive John Christmann said in a statement Tuesday.
Analysts said the announcement could lead to a more than $1 billion increase to the valuation of the project. The value of the project could increase significantly as Apache performs further tests, the analysts said.
Many investors have been closely monitoring Apache's activity in Suriname, which is near
a massive offshore oil field in Guyana
that Exxon is developing. Oil began flowing in December at the Exxon project, one of the largest offshore discoveries in years.
Investors have hoped the project in Suriname could resemble the find in neighboring Guyana. Exxon estimates it could recover more than six billion barrels of oil and gas from the Stabroek field there, which it is developing with partners Hess Corp. and China's Cnooc Ltd.
Analysts say Guyana, a tiny country with a population of less than one million people, could pump 750,000 barrels a day by 2025, making it one of the largest oil producers in Latin America. The find is likely to transform the impoverished nation, and a similar discovery in Suriname would carry significant implications for that country.
Apache struck a deal with Total last month to explore and develop the field in Suriname, in which the French energy giant will bear most of the project's significant costs. Under that deal, which analysts said was necessary to develop the field quickly, Total will recover its upfront costs from the project's early revenues before it reverts to a 50-50 profit share between the two companies.
""We are optimistic about the large remaining potential of the area still to be discovered and will test several other prospects on the same block,"" said Kevin McLachlan, senior vice president of exploration at Total.

| Jump to first hitMumbai: Shares of Adani Gas might have limited upside potential from the Total SA deal as analysts believe the French energy major's move might not significantly impact the Adani balance sheet but only help reduce the Indian conglomerate's incremental capex burden on expanding the gas business.
The shares of the company are already trading at steep multiples, leaving no room for major upsides.
Both partners plan to make significant investments in the next 10 years to develop India's gas infrastructure, distribution, and marketing businesses with a presence in more than 15 states. They plan to reach out to approximately 7.5 per cent of India's population and set up global-scale LNG, gas distribution and fuel retail infrastructure across the country.
""Adani Gas may not enjoy the success that IGL and MGL witnessed as the new geographical areas (GAs) for gas distribution lack the favourable characteristics - namely, regulatory push and population density of metro cities,"" an analyst at a domestic brokerage said. ""Network development in these new 23 GAs will require an investment of around Rs 150 billion over 5-6 years. The ambitious expansion plans and back-ended earnings will lead to poor returns.""
On Monday, however, Adani Gas surged 9 per cent on the news that Total SA would buy 37 per cent in the Gautam Adani-led company, which will include a public offer to shareholders to buy 25.2 per cent stake. Total said that the net acquisition cost would be $600 million over 2019-20. Both partners would eventually hold about 37 per cent each and plan to invest in infrastructure and assets worth over $1 billion, assets that span LNG infrastructure and marketing and fuel retailing.

Total has launched an open offer to buy 25.2 per cent stake, representing 27.71 crore shares of Adani Gas at a price of Rs 149.63 a share. On Monday, shares of Adani Gas touched an intraday high of Rs 162.40 but erased gains later in the session to inch closer to the offer price, ending at Rs 150.60.
The acquisition at around Rs 149.63 a share implies a valuation of 71 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is exorbitantly high for a company in the quasi-utility business, analysts said.

After agreeing to hold joint control of Adani Gas with a 37.4 per cent stake apiece, Total SA and the Adani family decided that the French oil and gas giant would approach the public shareholders first to mop up whatever it can from the market to reach its target.
Based on how much the minority shareholders tender during the open offer priced at Rs. 149.63 a share, Total will buy the remaining stake from the Adani family at the same price.
The Adani family currently holds 74.8 per cent stake in Adani Gas while public shareholders own the balance stake of 25.2 per cent.
At the conclusion of the deal, the Adani family and Total SA shareholders will hold 37.4 per cent each and the public shareholders will hold the remaining 25.2 per cent.
This means that whatever Total buys from the public, Adani family will offload the same quantity from its excess stake (beyond the 37.4 per cent it is supposed to hold) through an offer for sale (OFS) to maintain the public share holding at 25.2 per cent.
“It’s probably a nice way of structuring the transaction so that everybody who is getting a shareholding in it maintains whatever shareholding they want. Once you go to the public and do a buyback offer at a particular price and people want to sell, then you have to buy. It’s a commitment that you have made,” said an investment banker dealing with mergers and acquisitions.
“On the other hand, if first the Adani family were to sell 30 per cent to Total, and Total then goes for the open offer as per SEBI rules to buy a further 20 per cent from the public and the whole public sells to you, then Total will be stuck with a much larger percentage,” he said.
It may look a little difficult for the two parties to show joint control if suppose Adani offloads 30 per cent, and then you only want 7.4 per cent from the market to reach 37.4 per cent, but the market actually gives you 21 per cent, then the balance shifts from joint control to majority ownership for Total.
“So, if the objective is to have joint control of Adani Gas, it may be a beautiful way of doing it whereby you first go to the market and find out how much you are getting, and if the market gives you 15 per cent, then you go back to the drawing board and see how you can balance the shareholding between Adani and yourself and maintain the public shareholding at 25.2 per cent,” he added.
Launching an open offer first will also help decide the price, because typically when promoters want to dilute their stake first, they start by asking for a price which is more than the floor price that the market gives, said another investment banker.
“So, it appears as a complex but smart way of figuring out how much the public is ready to give and then rebalance the equation between the partners,” he stated."

French oil and gas giant Total SA has acquired a 37.4 per cent stake in Adani Gas Ltd, the listed gas unit of the diversified Adani Group, for Rs. 6,155 crore as it bets big on India’s shift towards a gas-based economy to address climate change concerns by using cleaner and greener fuels.
The deal gives Total joint control of Adani Gas. The acquisition is the largest foreign direct investment in India’s city gas distribution (CGD) sector.
Total, the world’s second-largest LNG company, will pick 37.4 per cent shares in Adani Gas through a tender offer to public shareholders to acquire up to 25.2 per cent shares at Rs. 149.63 per share, subject to applicable regulations, and purchase the residual shares from the Adani family.
The Adani family and Total SA shareholders will ultimately hold 37.4 per cent each, and public shareholders the remaining 25.2 per cent.
As part of the acquisition, Total will bring its LNG and retail expertise and also supply up to 3 mt of LNG to Adani Gas. Total and Adani will also establish a joint venture to market LNG in India and Bangladesh.
Taking into account the sale of its 26 per cent equity in the LNG re-gasification terminal at Hazira in Gujarat in early 2019, the gas partnership with Adani represents a net acquisition cost for Total of about $600 million over 2019-20, Total said in a statement.
“This partnership with Adani is a cornerstone to our development strategy in this country,” said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of Total.
“Energy needs in India are immense and the Indian energy mix is key to the climate change challenge. Firmly investing to develop the use of natural gas in India is in line with Total’s ambition to become a responsible energy major. The natural gas market in India will have a strong growth and is an attractive outlet for the world's second-largest LNG player that Total has become,” he added.
The deal is part of Total’s plan to invest as much as $18 billion a year between 2019 and 2023 to deliver growth, mostly through higher LNG sales of 50 million tonnes (mt) a year by 2025, according to a September 2019 presentation on ‘Strategy and Outlook’.
“Total’s investment in Adani Gas reinforces India’s natural gas and demand potential,” Gautam Adani, Chairman, Adani Group, said. “The partnership will derive significant synergies between Adani’s capabilities of developing world-class assets and Total’s global best practices as well as leveraging business synergies across LNG, fuel retail and city gas distribution,” he added.
Total plans to open 4,000 service stations in new markets by 2025, of which 1,000 would be in India, it said in the presentation.
City Gas Distribution is a natural extension of the plans of both partners to invest in infrastructure and assets worth over $1 billion, which span Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure and marketing and fuel retail business, announced in October 2018.
The expanded partnership will develop re-gasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG, on the east coast of India and market LNG to the Indian customers.

The acquisition at around Rs 149.63 a share implies a valuation of 71 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/ E) ratio, which is exorbitantly high for a company in the quasi-utility business, analysts said. Its peer Indraprastha Gas (IGL) is trading at 30 times trailing P/E, while Mahanagar Gas (MGL) is trading 20 times.

Its ambitious expansion plans and back ended earnings will lead to poor returns,"" a domestic brokerage said.
Analysts said the deal may not have any significant impact on the company's balance sheet, but would only reduce the contribution of Adani Group towards the capex of Adani Gas.

The 14-year-old sovereign wealth fund of the oil-rich Gulf nation could invest as much as Rs 3,000-4,000 crore for a minority stake of 20-25% in the business, said people in the know.
Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited, the country's largest private sector integrated power utility, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Transmission.

Subsequently, the Mumbai business got housed under a dropdown subsidiary.
The acquisition was financed by a Rs 8,500 crore of term debt from a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.

The funds are likely to help provide growth equity to the business and also deleverage the balance sheet. The company has also earmarked a capex of Rs 1,200 crore for maintenance, upgrade of its existing distribution network and capital addition.

Though the business has been stable with recurring cash flows, Varun Ahuja of JP Morgan said in a report in May that ""while capex guidance is higher, the additional cash flows from incremental operating assets and also from the Mumbai distribution asset enhance overall cash flows to keep credit metrics stable"". He also said that key credit driver in the near term remains equity market tap for replacing some of the subordinated perpetual instrument into common equity.
Even as a group, Adanis have looking at strategic partnerships across gas distribution, petrochemicals, renewables with marquee players like Total, BASF to de-risk its portfolio. ""This will be more of a financial investment with a reputed sovereign wealth fund that also has operational expertise in infrastructure, especially power sector,"" said a long-time Adani Group observer on the condition of anonymity.

Qatar Investment Authority is in negotiations with the Adani Group to buy a minority stake in the latter's flagship power transmission and distribution asset -- Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML). The 14-year-old sovereign wealth fund of the oilrich Gulf nation could invest as much as Rs 3,000-4,000 crore for a minority stake of 20-25% in the business, said people in the know.
Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited, the country's largest private sector integrated power utility, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Transmission.
In August 2018, Anil Ambani sold his Mumbai power distribution business to Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL) for Rs 12,700 crore, allowing the latter to enter the discom business. Subsequently, the Mumbai business got housed under a dropdown subsidiary.
The acquisition was financed by a Rs 8,500 crore of term debt from a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank.
The funds are likely to help provide growth equity to the business and also deleverage the balance sheet.
The company has also earmarked a capex of Rs 1,200 crore for maintenance, upgrade of its existing distribution network and capital addition.
The final contours of the transaction are still being worked out. But there is no certainty that the negotiations will fructify and result in a deal.
An Adani spokesperson declined to comment on speculations. Emails sent to QIA did not elicit a response till press time.
Several analysts had felt that the Mumbai acquisition was a richly valued one when it got announced and so an equity raise will be seen as a positive catalyst.
""The Mumbai discom acquisition is excessively expensive at a 3x P/ BV. This M&A translates to just 6.4% ROE for ATL, way below its cost of perpetual debt at 11.8% from promoters, leading to a negative spread,"" Bharat Parekh, an analyst with CLSA had said last November after the deal was completed.
Though the business has been stable with recurring cash flows, Varun Ahuja of JP Morgan said in a report in May that ""while capex guidance is higher, the additional cash flows from incremental operating assets and also from the Mumbai distribution asset enhance overall cash flows to keep credit metrics stable"".
He also said that key credit driver in the near term remains equity market tap for replacing some of the subordinated perpetual instrument into common equity.
Even as a group, Adanis have looking at strategic partnerships across gas distribution, petrochemicals, renewables with marquee players like Total, BASF to de-risk its portfolio. ""This will be more of a financial investment with a reputed sovereign wealth fund that also has operational expertise in infrastructure, especially power sector,"" said a long-time Adani Group observer on the condition of anonymity.
Adani is already in advanced negotiations with Total SA for selling around 30% stake in his city gas distribution company Adani Gas for around Rs 5,500 crore. The move that will eventually see the French energy giant become an equal equity partner in the company along with promoter Gautam Adani.
Interestingly, QIA is also an investor in Total SA.
AEML's integrated business of power generation, transmission and retail electricity distribution serves over three million consumers spread across 400 sq kms in Mumbai and its suburbs, meeting close to 2,000 mw of power demand. Following the takeover, the company witnessed the lowest distribution loss in FY19 at 7.85%, down from 8.12% in FY18.
The business also entails 500 mw of thermal power generation capacity, 800 mw of distribution along with generation facilities, besides an underground network of over 1,000 km. The distribution franchise is nine decades old with the licence valid till August 2036. All three business segments of AEML operate under a cost plus fixed ROE regime subject to maintenance of operational parameters above normative levels. The licence area has earned 17-18% return on equity from the business through better operations. operating metrics.
For the seven months ending March 2019, AEML posted a profit after tax (PAT) of Rs 43 crore on revenue of Rs 4,270 crore.

Royal Dutch Shell PLC's profit plunged in the second quarter, with
lower oil and gas prices
and weaker refining margins outweighing a rise in production.
The Anglo-Dutch oil giant's results came in well below expectations and marked a poor quarter for energy majors, suggesting that their efforts to rejig and diversify their portfolios haven't fully cushioned them from swings in oil and gas prices and refining margins.
Brent crude—the global benchmark—traded around 7% lower in the second quarter compared with the previous year and European and Asian gas prices were down sharply.
Across the industry, there was also a slowdown in demand for chemicals, Shell said.
France's Total SA and Norway's Equinor ASA both reported profit declines last week and missed analysts' expectations. However, BP PLC beat expectations, reporting quarterly profits that were flat compared with the comparable period a year earlier.
Many energy companies slashed their portfolios in the wake of the oil price collapse in 2014, with a focus on keeping only the most profitable assets and cost-cutting where possible. Shell completed a $30 billion divestment program last year and plans to sell another $10 billion worth of assets by the end of 2020.
At its management day in June, the company said it intended to sell or close nine of its 19 refineries by 2025.
""We think we'll end up with something like 10 [remaining refineries] and these will be really the top-notch refineries that have longevity and resilience through the cycle,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Thursday.
U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are set to report their results Friday.
Exxon Mobil warned earlier in July that weaker natural gas prices and margins from its chemicals business could weigh on its second-quarter profit.
Shell reported a lower plant utilization in chemicals and a loss in refining in its quarterly results.
""This is always a much bigger issue for Exxon and Shell [than their peers],"" Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein said, referring to weaker margins in refining and chemicals.
Shell said its quarterly profit on a current cost-of-supplies basis—a number similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—was $3.03 billion, down from $5.23 billion a year earlier. Adjusted results missed the company-provided analyst consensus by almost a third.
Its shares closed 6.5% lower on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Shell's chemical plants operated at 85% availability for the quarter, down from 93% a year earlier, due to strike action in the Netherlands and maintenance.
Its rising output, bolstered by fields in North America, wasn't enough to offset lower commodity prices. Shell's production rose 4% to 3.58 million barrels a day compared with a year earlier. Its output is also expected to rise in the third quarter as production ramps up from some fields and liquefied natural gas projects.
Total and BP also posted solid production increases. After the 2014 oil price collapse lead to dramatic cuts to investment plans, companies are back
investing in new production
, albeit sometimes in the form of acquisitions rather than developing their own exploration finds.
Total is on track to raise production by 9% this year, helped by its acquisition of Maersk Oil's assets which closed a year ago, alongside projects starting up, including in Angola and the North Sea.
""In Shell's case for instance we do have the startup of several major projects that are contributing to production growth,"" said Jefferies equity analyst Jason Gammel, adding that some of these, including the Appomattox project in the Gulf of Mexico, were sanctioned before the 2014 downturn.
Shell's cash flow from operations rose to $11.03 billion from $9.5 billion in the prior-year period.
It has pivoted toward gas production since its 2015 deal to buy BG Group PLC, known for its global liquefied natural gas business.
After the acquisition, Shell committed to a $25 billion share buyback program, which it launched last year. The company said it would buy back $2.75 billion of shares in the next tranche, in line with the first quarter of 2019.
The company maintained its quarterly dividend at 47 cents a share.

French oil and gas giant Total SA has taken a 50 per cent stake in Dhamra LNG Terminal Pvt Ltd (DLTPL), a unit of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ), which is constructing a 12-million-tonne-per-annum LNG re-gasification terminal at its port located at Dhamra in Odisha’s Bhadrak district.
BusinessLine could not ascertain the value of the deal, the first after the New York Stock Exchange-listed French multinational and the world’s second biggest private LNG firm announced a joint venture in October 2018 with the Adani Group to develop multi-energy offerings for the Indian market, including LNG and fuel retailing, multiple sources said.
Total could not be reached immediately for comment, while a comment from APSEZ is awaited.
The LNG terminal at Dhamra is being built with an investment of Rs. 5,200 crore. APSEZ-owned Dhamra Port Co Ltd has applied to the expert appraisal committee (EAC) attached to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, to transfer the environment and coastal regulation zone clearances for the 12 mtpa terminal in favour of the LNG terminal company, according to documents reviewed by BusinessLine .
The LNG terminal is set to start operations by mid-2021. Apart from meeting local demand for gas, the terminal is of strategic importance for gas supply to neighbouring Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal.
The Dhamra terminal can supply Bangladesh 3-5 mtpa (Dhamra to Bangladesh is less than 300 nautical miles by sea and the distance by road to eastern Bangladesh is under 500 km).
IOC-GAIL pact
India’s biggest oil refiner, Indian Oil Corporation, and the country’s largest natural gas firm, GAIL (India) Ltd, have separately signed long-term offtake agreements with Dhamra LNG Terminal for re-gasified LNG.
IOC has booked 3 mtpa re-gasification capacity for 20 years at the Dhamra facility on a use or pay basis, helping the state-run oil refiner supply gas to its refineries in Paradip, Haldia and Barauni.
GAIL India has booked 1.5 mtpa re-gasification capacity for 20 years on a use or pay basis. GAIL plans to supply the gas to its customers located in the eastern region and along the Jagdishpur– Haldia gas grid, which is under development.
Initially, the terminal will have two full containment type tanks of 180,000 cubic metre capacity each.
The LNG terminal will have an 18-metre draft jetty capable of handling a wide range of LNG supply vessels, including the largest Q-max (266,000 cubic metre) fleet from Qatar, thereby optimising sea transportation. The terminal will be capable of reloading LNG to service proximate markets via the marine route and will also have truck loading gantries to help grow the nascent LNG by truck market. India is seeking to cut its carbon emissions rate by a third by 2030, partly by boosting the use of cleaner fuels such as LNG. The shift to cleaner fuels such as LNG is also aimed at honouring India’s commitment to the Paris accord on climate change.
Gas-based economy
By expanding the use of LNG, India is also looking to change course to a gas-based economy. It is seeking to raise gas share to 15 per cent in the primary energy mix, from 6 per cent by 2022. India currently has four LNG terminals and imports around 20 mtpa LNG, which it plans to increase to 70 mtpa by 2025.
This shift has positive implications not only from a climate change point of view, but also from a fiscal stand point, given India’s huge crude import bill.
The cost advantages of LNG are such that for a 4 per cent replacement of crude imports with LNG, India will save $1 billion in foreign exchange annually.
India’s LNG imports are estimated to rise in the face of declining domestic production of gas, rendering LNG import and re-gasification terminals such as the one being constructed at Dhamra a necessity.
Assuming domestic gas production at 123–138 mmscmd, India’s LNG imports is estimated to touch about 250 mmscmd or nearly 70 MTPA by 2025."

| Jump to first hitCanadian Natural Resources Ltd. has solidified its position in the oilsands and as the country's largest oil and gas producer with a $3.8-billion purchase of Devon Energy Corp.'s Canadian business. And it got them at a bargain price.
CNRL announced the deal Wednesday for Oklahoma Citybased Devon's Jackfish oilsands project, heavy oil wells and undeveloped lands in a move that will boost the Calgary-based oil giant's total production to 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day this year from one million barrels.
""The acquired assets are in Canadian Natural's backyard,"" Steve Laut, the company's executive vice-chairman, said on an investor call, adding the purchase price is ""significantly below"" the cost to build the facilities from scratch.
Indeed, analysts widely expected the assets to sell for a higher price, with some estimates as high as $9 billion but most in the $5 billion to $6 billion range.
""Much as we expected, if CNRL was going to be the ultimate acquirer, we expected the company to be highly price sensitive/disciplined and we believe that is seen in the ultimate purchase price,"" CIBC World Markets analyst Jon Morrison wrote in a note.
He had previously said the assets would sell for between $3.5 billion and $5.5 billion.
Canadian Natural shares jumped almost four per cent to close at $36.86 in Toronto.
CNRL is already the largest oil and gas company in the country by volume and one of the biggest of the major oil producers not owned by governments, according to Wood Mackenzie.
""The company is also the 25th-largest producer in the world,"" according to Stephen Kallir, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""When you remove national oil corporations, it is the eighth-largest, behind only the majors and ConocoPhillips. In comparison, Devon will drop from 49th to 56th.""
Exxon Mobil Inc., Royal Dutch Shell Plc., BP Plc, Chevron Inc., Total SA, Equinor ASA, Eni SpA are considered oil majors, distinct from state-owned enterprises such as Saudi Aramco and China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec.
Canadian Natural has also been ""the most acquisitive"" large Canadian oil company and could continue to strike more deals, said New York-based Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick.
""This is a company that historically does a really good job of taking assets out of another company's hands that might not be such a good fit there and then squeezing those costs down,"" said Phil Skolnick, an analyst with Eight Capital based in New York.
When CNRL bought Shell Canada Ltd.'s oilsands business for $12.7 billion in 2017, the company created one management team for its own Horizon oilsands mine and Shell's Athabasca oilsands mines, Skolnick said, noting he expects CNRL will do the same thing with Devon's assets.
Analysts quizzed CNRL management on Wednesday's investor call how they got the properties at such a low valuation - 60 per cent less on a per-barrel basis than they paid for Shell's assets two years ago.
Company president Tim McKay offered that the Shell assets included an oilsands upgrader and produce light, synthetic crude oil rather than heavy oil, which the Devon assets produce. He also said, ""It was a different time that transaction was done.""
Since that time, Canadian oil production has surpassed export pipeline capacity and heavy oil prices in the country have fallen sharply.
They continue to be exposed to large discounts relative to international benchmarks like West Texas Intermediate.
Western Canada Select heavy oil traded for an average of US$42.23 per barrel Tuesday, which is US$15.41 per barrel lower than WTI prices, which averaged US$57.64 per barrel.
Eight Capital's Skolnick said that given CNRL's now increased exposure to more heavy oil, the company will look to purchase the government of Alberta's oil-by-rail contracts to move some of Devon's production out of the country.
And with fewer international companies competing in the space, oilsands operating costs could drop further, Skolnick said.
Husky Energy Inc. president and CEO Rob Peabody told investors Tuesday that the concentration of assets in the hands of a few large Calgary-based companies in the oilsands has resulted in a ""lower competitive intensity"" in the play, which had driven down costs.
In selling out of the oilsands, Devon joins Shell, Norway's Statoil, France's Total SA, Arkansas-based Murphy Oil and Houston-based ConocoPhillips in selling either all or parts of their oilsands holdings to Canadian players.
""The sale of Canada is an important step in executing Devon's transformation to a U.S. oil growth business,"" Devon president and CEO David Hager said in a news release Wednesday.
Including Wednesday's deal, Canadian companies have now spent $37.4 billion consolidating their positions in the oilsands in recent years and buying foreign companies out of the play.
""You've got the majority of Canadian oilsands assets in the hands of very few large Canadian oil companies,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis.
She said CNRL likely got the Devon assets for 25-per-cent less than most analysts expected because there are fewer buyers for oilsands assets.
Suncor Energy Inc. had signalled it wasn't in talks to buy the assets earlier this month, while Cenovus Energy Inc. is still digesting its $17.7-billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips's oilsands assets in 2017.
This left just a few potential buyers Devon could market the assets to.
""The shuffling of assets is over at this point. The only other one out there right now would be MEG Energy Corp.,"" Rowland said, noting that Husky had tried to acquire MEG in a hostile takeover in 2018 but ultimately abandoned the transaction.
She added that there were smaller transactions that could be done in the oilsands, such as purchasing minority working interests in existing projects.
But the largest and most expensive assets in the formation have already changed hands.
""There are small pieces here and there. Nothing of the dollar and magnitude that we've seen in these transactions,"" she said.

SYDNEY—Papua New Guinea, an impoverished South Pacific nation that joined the ranks of the world's significant energy exporters five years ago, installed a new prime minister who has called for greater local control of resources, in a move that may upset a gas deal with international energy giants.
The new prime minister, James Marape, was elected by lawmakers on Thursday to succeed Peter O'Neill, who led the resource-rich nation for seven years and
stepped down this week
amid intensifying political unrest and government defections.
Mr. O'Neill had come under intense pressure in recent weeks over a plan the government agreed to in April with French oil major Total SA, U.S. petroleum giant Exxon Mobil Corp. and Australia's Oil Search Ltd. The multibillion-dollar project is part of a broader industry expansion aimed at doubling Papua New Guinea's liquefied natural gas exports to help meet
surging global demand
. Local communities in the country's highlands have questioned projected revenues and employment guarantees.
""I think we will certainly see the project agreements be reviewed and the process slowed a bit"" following the change of leadership, said Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific expert at Sydney's Lowy Institute. Still, he added that while Mr. Marape has been critical of the way the former prime minister managed the negotiation process, ""I don't think he is hostile towards the sector or the project as a whole.""
Mr. Marape defected from Mr. O'Neill's government and resigned from his post as finance minister in April, days after the Total deal was signed, citing differences with Mr. O'Neill over natural-resources policy. Mr. Marape said at the time that he wanted ""more local content participation in our gas, oil sector or mining industry.""
""We will look into maximizing gain from what God has given this country—from our natural resources,"" he said on Thursday. ""I have every right to tweak and turn resources laws for my country.""
The change of leadership could delay production by roughly two years, to beyond 2025, consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said. The Total-led Papua LNG gas export plan and a separate expansion of an existing Exxon Mobil-led project are awaiting final investment decisions from the companies, and could also be deferred in favor of developments elsewhere. Total and Exxon couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
When Papua New Guinea signed its first big gas deal a decade ago, the government was betting on a revenue windfall it hoped would transform the nation better known for jungles, violence and corruption.
But the payday from the existing $19 billion Exxon Mobil-led project, which
started operating in 2014
, has so far been a trickle. That project was crimped by a downturn in gas prices that allowed Exxon and its partners to claim losses against royalty payments, fueling anger among residents over whether they were receiving a fair share of the country's resources wealth.
Governments of many developing nations rich in resources are pressing companies for a greater share of the wealth to plug budget deficits,
via higher taxes and demand for greater stakes
in mines and fields.
A former Australian colony of eight million, Papua New Guinea has long relied on foreign aid. The country has minimal infrastructure outside the capital, Port Moresby, and companies typically negotiate terms with local landowners to gain access to resources—a knotty problem in a country with hundreds of ethnic groups.
Despite its resource wealth, Papua New Guinea is still one of the world's least-developed nations. Gross domestic product per capita was just $2,745 in 2015, according to the International Monetary Fund. Many residents
lack electricity and running water
. The more affluent live behind high fences, protected by armed guards. An earthquake last year left thousands homeless.
The country is also battling health crises, including one of the world's highest rates of tuberculosis. In June, health authorities declared the country's first polio outbreak in 18 years.
To bridge the revenue gap and revive its slowing economy, Mr. O'Neill's government had

""It will be interesting to see how Marape moves to differ himself from O'Neill,"" said the Lowy Institute's Mr. Pryke. After Mr. O'Neill stepped aside, Mr. Marape brought his supporters back to the ruling coalition, which likely means ""a lot of familiar faces"" in senior government positions, he added.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The Federal Trade Commission accused former Pioneer Natural Resources Chief Executive Scott Sheffield earlier this month of colluding with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. That sounds sinister, but is it?
Antitrust laws prohibit collusion, and mostly for good reason. It leads to a lack of competition, causing higher prices that harm consumers. The only winners are the companies involved that get to maximize their own profits at the expense of consumers. In more-recent decades, industries accused of collusion have included airlines and credit cards. Yet oil is a commodity for which that neat equation -- more competition, less harm -- is frequently complicated.
Oil's history is full of attempts at stabilizing prices. Petroleum is an essential commodity that has high capital needs and long lead times: That lends itself to boom-and-bust cycles that are painful for consumers, governments and companies. There is no immediate cure for price spikes or plunges because it is impossible to turn on significant new oil supply or to turn off demand for it on short notice. Storage helps, but oil must be kept underground or in specialized tanks.
Done effectively, managing oil supply tames volatility. The wild boom-and-bust cycle between 1859 and 1879 was followed by a period of relative price stability, when John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly reigned.
In fact, the most stable period of oil prices was between the 1930s and 1970s when the Railroad Commission of Texas tightly controlled supply, according to analysis from consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group. At the time, Texas set the rate at which every well in the state could produce, using the military to monitor compliance and coordinating with other states. OPEC is the most recent example of supply management, though it has been less effective.
Legal considerations aside, passing judgment on price fixing ultimately comes down to whether one believes oil-price volatility causes more harm in the longer term than good.
Proponents of oil supply management say the boom-and-bust cycles are too painful. Rapidan founder Bob McNally says the only thing worse than oil supply management is the lack of oil supply management. Price swings can complicate monetary policy, make national budget planning difficult and even trigger social unrest in oil-dependent countries, he argues in the book ""Crude Volatility.""
But stable prices also mute market signals. High oil prices in the 1970s following the Arab oil embargo and Iranian Revolution encouraged the development of high-cost oil resources such as those in Alaska, the North Sea, Mexico and Canada, ultimately helping the world become less reliant on OPEC. And high prices in the 2010s helped U.S. producers pursue fracking aggressively. The bust that followed pushed frackers to find efficiencies.
Proponents of supply management, though, say stable prices are more conducive to long-term investment than up-and-down cycles. Looking forward, price signals are an important nudge for alternative energy sources, says Arjun Murti, partner at energy research and investment firm Veriten.
There are a few reasons price fixing seems less necessary today. For all the alarm bells that go off when pump prices rise, volatility hurts a lot less -- at least for some countries. The U.S. went from importing twice as much oil as it produced in 2006 to becoming a net exporter starting in 2020. And fuel now takes up a smaller portion of Americans' budgets: Households on average also are wealthier than they used to be and cars are more fuel efficient.
Second, fracking itself has helped supply respond faster because shale wells using the method can be brought online in a matter of months rather than years.
Associating ""OPEC"" and ""collusion"" with an American energy CEO sounds bad, but it is also hard to see how effective Sheffield could have been. Oil production is scattered: There are thousands of producers in the U.S. alone. And OPEC itself has failed many times to collude.
Thankfully for consumers, price-fixing isn't only less necessary today but also a lot harder to do.

Exxon Mobil has completed its $60 billion acquisition of rival Pioneer Natural Resources after reaching an agreement with antitrust regulators, closing out the largest oil-and-gas deal in decades.
The oil giant said Friday that the megadeal more than doubles its footprint in the Permian Basin, located in the southwest of the U.S. The combined company has more than 1.4 million net acres in the Delaware and Midland basins.
Exxon's Permian production volume is expected to more than double to 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. That figure should rise to 2 million barrels in 2027, the company said.
The deal was closed after Exxon agreed not to add Scott Sheffield, Pioneer's former chief executive, to its board of directors, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.
The concession appeased the Federal Trade Commission which subsequently accused Sheffield of colluding with officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices. The allegations have been referred to the Justice Department.

Exxon Mobil is set to close its $60 billion megadeal for Pioneer Natural Resources following an agreement with antitrust enforcers not to add former Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield to its board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Federal Trade Commission was set to allege as soon as this week that Sheffield engaged in collusive activity that could have raised the price of oil, these people said. The allegations will include that Sheffield sent hundreds of messages to representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries about market dynamics, including pricing and production levels.
There is no allegation of any wrongdoing by Exxon, according to the people.
The oil giant will enter into a consent decree with the FTC, agreeing to keep Sheffield off the board, the people said. With the filing of that agreement, the deal between Exxon and Pioneer could close within days.
Sheffield declined to comment.
Exxon agreed in October to buy Pioneer for $60 billion in stock, marking its biggest deal since it merged with Mobil in the late 1990s and the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades.
The Houston-based oil giant is set to acquire Pioneer's massive swath of prolific oil land in the Midland Basin of West Texas, where the smaller shale driller has operated for decades.
In December, the companies disclosed the FTC had sought additional information from the companies about the deal, a step it takes when reviewing whether a merger could be anticompetitive under U.S. law.
Exxon and Pioneer together submitted millions of documents for the antitrust probe, people familiar with the matter said.
The antitrust enforcers will allege Sheffield attempted to coordinate an anticompetitive campaign to curtail output by American frackers, which could have raised oil prices and thus benefited Pioneer, the people said.
For years, investors urged frackers to stop overspending on drilling new wells and pumping ever-increasing amounts of crude, and instead to keep production largely flat, which would increase cash flows and enable higher returns to shareholders. It took years -- and the crippling Covid-19 pandemic -- for shale producers to agree.
U.S. frackers fiercely competed for years with OPEC for market share.
At a 2017 dinner in Houston, shale executives sat down for a first-of-its-kind dinner with Mohammad Barkindo, who was then the secretary-general of OPEC. Sheffield attended the dinner, during which Barkindo discussed OPEC negotiations on cutting oil output, among other topics.
""They're trying to find out more about U.S. shale and we're trying to find out what OPEC is thinking,"" Sheffield said at the time.
After the onset of the pandemic in 2020, a historic drop in oil demand prompted U.S. producers to dramatically cut their drilling rigs, shut in wells and slow production growth. They stuck with capital discipline for years, with Pioneer and other large shale companies vowing more conservative spending and to send more cash to shareholders.
Pioneer and many other oil producers reaped billions more in cash flow in the years that followed, and distributed much of that to investors. Energy prices spiked in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
As The Wall Street Journal previously reported, after years of rapid drilling, limitations on shale companies' inventory of potential drilling locations have also prevented them from speeding up oil-production growth to prior high levels.
Executives and investment bankers cited inventory concerns as a crucial driver behind a wave of mergers and acquisitions that began last year.
Sheffield started working for Pioneer's predecessor company, Parker & Parsley Petroleum, in 1979. That company merged with another in 1997 to form Pioneer. Sheffield had retired in 2016 but returned to the job in 2019. He retired for a second time at the end of 2023, after the sale of Pioneer to Exxon was proposed.

| Jump to first hitIn 2023, crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies increased spending on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to $234 billion, the most in real 2023 dollars since 2012. Recent dealmaking marks a return to the previous trend of consolidation among oil companies in the United States after transactions declined amid significant oil market volatility in 2020 and 2022. Spending on M&A includes both corporate M&A and asset acquisitions. Corporate M&A involves one company merging or acquiring another company. Asset acquisition is when one owner purchases an asset from another owner. Corporate M&A was 82% of total announced spending, due in large part to two in-progress deals: ExxonMobil's announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources for $64.5 billion and Chevron's announced acquisition of Hess Corporation for $60 billion. These deals are the largest by value in real terms since Occidental Petroleum Corporation acquired Anadarko Petroleum Corporation for a total acquisition cost of $55 billion in 2019.Corporate M&A and asset acquisitions, such as acreage sales, can be attractive for both buyers and sellers. Buyers can purchase proved reserves instead of using capital expenditures on exploration and development that might not generate profitable assets. Some companies may also want to diversify their portfolios or purchase acreage that geographically complements their existing portfolios, which can lead to lower costs and greater production efficiency. Sellers may see selling property or merging with companies as beneficial for shareholders or, in some cases, may seek out buyers as a way to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and improve balance sheets.One result of recent consolidation activity is larger companies that own more producing assets. Chevron is currently the largest crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) producer in the United States, accounting for 5% of the U.S. total with average production of just over 1.0 million barrels per day (b/d) in the third quarter of 2023 (3Q23). If Chevron successfully acquires Hess Corporation, it could increase Chevron's share of U.S production to 6% (just over 1.2 million b/d), based on 3Q23 data. Similarly, ExxonMobil, the fourth-largest crude oil and NGL producer in the United States, has the potential to increase its production to nearly 7% of total U.S. production (from about 750,000 b/d to 1.3 million b/d) if it successfully acquires Pioneer Natural Resources. Barring any other large production or asset ownership changes, recent M&A could make ExxonMobil the largest crude oil and NGL producer in the United States.ExxonMobil's goals for the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources include increasing the company's footprint in the Permian Basin in West Texas, realizing advantages from combining ExxonMobil's and Pioneer's adjoining acreage, and reducing overall risk in its production portfolio by increasing its domestic crude oil production, based on public statements. ExxonMobil expects that combining its 570,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland Basins-both sub-basins of the Permian Basin-with Pioneer's more than 850,000 net acres in the Midland Basin will result in an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) worth of reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian has been the main source of increasing crude oil production in the United States in recent years, and we expect it to continue to be a major source for production growth in the United States going forward.Public statements suggest Chevron's primary goal for acquiring Hess Corporation is to gain access to the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana. The Stabroek Block is the world's largest oil discovery in the last 10 years; Chevron estimates the block has more than 11 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Hess owns a 30% stake in the Stabroek Block, ExxonMobil owns 45%, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation owns 25%. ExxonMobil filed an arbitration claim to block Chevron's acquisition of Hess's Stabroek Block stake, claiming a right to first refusal of a sale. The outcome of the claim could affect whether the acquisition is completed or not. Other recent notable deals include:- Diamondback Energy announced it will merge with Endeavor Energy for a total transaction cost of $26 billion, which is the total cost for Diamondback Energy to acquire all Endeavor Energy shares, its net debt, and transaction costs from the merger. The combined company has the potential to be the third-largest oil and natural gas producer in the Permian Basin, behind ExxonMobil and Chevron.- Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced it will acquire CrownRock L.P. for a total acquisition cost of $12 billion. Occidental, which produced about 1.2 million BOE per day (BOE/d) of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas in 3Q23, expects to add 170,000 BOE/d of production in 2024 from CrownRock's assets in the Midland Basin.- Chesapeake Energy announced it will merge with Southwestern Energy for a total transaction cost of $11.5 billion, which is the total cost for Chesapeake Energy to acquire all Southwestern Energy shares, its net debt, and transaction costs from the merger. The combined company, which will assume a new name at closing, could become the largest natural gas producer in the United States.- Chevron acquired PDC Energy, Inc., for a total acquisition cost of $7.6 billion in August 2023. Prior to acquisition, PDC Energy produced 178,000 b/d of crude oil and NGL in 2Q23, mainly from assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado.- ExxonMobil acquired Denbury, Inc., for a total acquisition cost of $4.9 billion in November 2023. The deal provides ExxonMobil with the largest CO2 pipeline network in the United States and 10 onshore sequestration sites used for carbon capture and storage.- APA Corporation announced it will acquire Callon Petroleum Company for a total acquisition cost of $4.5 billion. In 3Q23, APA Corporation produced 150,000 b/d of crude oil and NGL in the United States, and Callon Petroleum Company produced 81,000 b/d. Both companies operate primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.Principal contributor: Alex De Keyserling(U.S. Energy Information Administration)"

| Jump to first hitM&A remained muted in 2023, but Wall Street banks still benefited from a string of megadeals. Business Insider partnered with financial-data firm MergerLinks to identify 2023's top-20 bankers.The ranking spotlights bankers who led the advisory process for the largest M&A in North America.
In September, something arrived that Scott Sheffield, the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources, one the country’s largest oil producers, had been anticipating for months: a takeover offer from ExxonMobil that would shake up the industry.
The two firms had held informal deal discussions over the years, which grew more serious over the summer. But when Exxon’s formal deal proposal arrived on September 19, Sheffield quickly rejected it. He was already strategizing with his deal mavens — a team from Goldman Sachs led by Suhail Sikhtian and a Morgan Stanley crew including senior bankers Greg Weinberger and Aaron Hoover — and they believed Pioneer could get more. Sheffield was angling for a richer price for Pioneer shareholders, of course, but he also wanted other terms, including two board seats, a breakup fee from Exxon if the deal was scuttled for regulatory reasons, and assurances that Pioneer’s Texas headquarters would remain open for at least two years after the deal.
As negotiations heated up, Pioneer added the BofA energy expert Patrick Ramsey to its team while Exxon leaned on Citigroup’s head of energy investment banking, Claudio Sauer, and a team of bankers from the boutique firm, Centerview Partners. The parties brokered a compromise — Sheffield got his board seats, the headquarters, and more money, but not the breakup fee. They had a deal.
On October 11, they announced the $64.5 billion merger, the largest transaction of the year — and a boon to Wall Street in what had been, up to that point, a lackluster year for global mergers and acquisitions.
Wall Street’s mergers-and-acquisitions business dropped to a 10-year low in 2023, according to LSEG Group. In 2023, the overall value of M&A transactions dipped globally to $2.9 trillion across 53,529 deals, down from $3.4 trillion across 57,830 transactions in 2022. Nevertheless, bankers tasked with executing mega deals like Exxon-Pioneer and Chevron's $60 billion acquisition of Hess, also announced late last year, stood to make millions in fees for their banks and help their employers climb the competitive M&A league tables.
So who are the powerhouse dealmakers behind the biggest corporate mergers and acquisitions of 2023? Business Insider partnered with MergerLinks, a financial-data service that tracks deals, to present the fifth edition of ""The Rainmakers,"" the 20 M&A bankers who orchestrated the largest deals in North America.
MergerLinks tracks publicly announced deals and calculates deal values on a net basis, including both equity and debt pieces. To make the individual league table, a banker must have been the lead advisor on either side of a transaction.
This year’s list has a mix of returnees and first-timers and was dominated by energy bankers, including Goldman’s Sikhtian and Morgan Stanley’s Hoover. The latter bank has four dealmakers on the list this year, including two in the top five, thanks to its work on both the ExxonMobil-Pioneer and Chevron-Hess tie-ups. Nearly half of the bankers on this year's list worked on energy deals.
Centerview Partners also has four bankers on the list, while the boutique investment bank MTS Health Partners, which was founded in 1999, is making its first appearance on the list after helping land one of the year’s biggest healthcare deals: the sale of the biotech company Seagen to Pfizer for $43 billion.
Just one woman made the 2023 ranking, an improvement over 2022 when the list was all men.

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Chevron's $53 billion proposed deal to buy Hess, the second-biggest oil megamerger this year.
Chevron and Hess said Friday the antitrust enforcer is seeking additional information about the merger, a move signaling the commission is reviewing whether the deal could be anticompetitive under U.S. law.
The companies' disclosure comes on the heels of another new FTC merger investigation, this one into Exxon Mobil's $59.5 billion all-stock deal to scoop up Pioneer Natural Resources. It would be the largest oil-and-gas transaction since Exxon's $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s.
Chevron's purchase of Hess would make the oil major a partner in an Exxon-led consortium developing a generational oil find in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% stake. Chevron would also acquire assets in North Dakota's Bakken Shale, where Hess is one of dozens of operators.
Braden Reddall, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company is working productively with the commission and will respond to its request ""in a timely manner to advance a successful close of the transaction.""
The oil-and-gas assets owned by Chevron and Hess have little overlap compared with the Exxon-Pioneer tie-up. That deal would make Exxon the largest operator by far in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the country's most active oil field. Exxon has noted their combined production would only make up about 3% of the world's daily output, and 5% of U.S. oil-and-gas production.
The commission and the Justice Department typically probe about 2% to 3% of deals that are reported to the government. Those agencies can take companies to court to try to block a merger.
Agencies with antitrust authority have rarely taken action against oil-and-gas producers, often taking the view they compete in a global market. Some oil executives and deal makers had anticipated a recent series of acquisitions would draw antitrust scrutiny, but have said they saw little chance the FTC would prevail in court if it pursued legal action.
Under the Biden administration, the commission has become more active in taking action against large mergers, challenging 11 deals in court. Five deals were canceled after the FTC filed lawsuits to block them.
But the commission has lost some antitrust court challenges against large companies such as Microsoft, which a judge allowed this summer to purchase Activision Blizzard for $75 billion.

U.S. antitrust enforcers are investigating Exxon Mobil's plan to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources, which would be the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades, according to securities filings.
The Federal Trade Commission has sought additional information from the companies about the deal, a step it takes when reviewing whether a merger could be anticompetitive under U.S. law, Pioneer disclosed in a filing Tuesday. Merger investigations on average take about 10 months to complete, according to data compiled by law firm Dechert.
The FTC, which shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, can sue in court to block a merger or decline to take action, effectively clearing the deal. Companies sometimes cancel deals when they learn an antitrust agency plans to sue to stop the transaction. The agencies annually investigate about 2% to 3% of the deals that are large enough to require reporting to the government.
Exxon in October proposed to buy Pioneer in a $59.5 billion all-stock deal, a takeover that would make Exxon the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most active U.S. oil field. It would be Exxon's largest deal since its $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s.
""We're working to provide requested information,"" Exxon spokeswoman Michelle Gray said. ""From an anticompetitive perspective, it's critical to remember the combined companies represent approximately 5% of the total U.S. oil and gas production.""
Oil companies' shares fell as U.S. crude prices dropped Tuesday. Exxon shares fell almost 2% Tuesday to $100.44. Pioneer shares also fell 2% to $225.78.
Some oil executives and deal makers had anticipated a recent series of acquisitions would draw federal antitrust scrutiny. But antitrust regulators have rarely taken measures to thwart deals involving oil producers, often taking the view that their products compete globally.
Investors expect larger oil companies to continue scooping up smaller rivals. As top-tier drilling spots have become harder to find in the Permian, executives have realized they can extract more value out of their land by selling it than by drilling it.
Two weeks after Exxon announced its plans, Chevron said it would buy Hess in a $53 billion all-stock deal. Occidental Petroleum is in talks to purchase CrownRock, a large private oil company in the Permian, for more than $10 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Some analysts have argued that Exxon and Pioneer together make up a negligible portion of global oil production and that the deal couldn't affect prices for oil or fuel. Exxon said it could save billions of dollars in value via synergies by bringing its operations to Pioneer's land and played down the need to make cuts to head count.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the deal would increase U.S. energy security and benefit consumers by bringing the oil company's technical prowess and financial wherewithal to bear on shale resources.

More than half of U.S. shale oil production comes from the Permian Basin. Pioneer's acreage is some of the region's best, with some 16 years of drilling locations left at its current pace of operations, according to energy analytics firm Enverus.
Exxon has said the companies could pump 2 million barrels of oil a day by 2027 in the Permian. The region currently produces nearly 6 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration.
The FTC issued the investigative request to the companies on Monday. Pioneer said the companies are cooperating and still expect the deal to be completed in the first half of 2024.
In 2016, oil-field service companies Halliburton and Baker Hughes canceled a nearly $35 billion tie-up after the Justice Department and regulators in other countries pushed back. Those companies provide equipment and services to oil producers like Exxon.
The FTC during the Biden administration has taken a tough stance on mergers , although its court record is mixed, particularly when it tried to block large technology deals.
The commission under Chair Lina Khan has taken action in court to challenge 11 deals, including acquisitions by Meta Platforms and Microsoft. Nineteen firms have abandoned deals after coming under FTC investigation, including five that were called off after the FTC sued to block them.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
How low can they go?
U.S. shale developers have been on a relentless chase to drill for oil as cheaply as possible. With plenty of cash in their pockets and a hunch that they might soon exhaust their best inventory in the Permian Basin, some companies are shifting their focus to making sure they get every last drop of crude they can get out of what they have. That could mean higher costs today.
Producers did a great job of maximizing initial production. U.S. land and offshore productivity -- measured as the amount of oil produced in the first 12 months per foot drilled -- has been on a steady upward trajectory since 2007, according to data from Enverus.
U.S. onshore and offshore wells that have been producing for 12 months since August 2022 were 59% more productive compared with those that were drilled five years earlier, the data show.
It is unclear how long productivity gains can continue at this pace. There may be a limit on how long lateral wells can get. Not only does the lengthening of a well require more contiguous land, but also the longer wells get, the trickier it is to service them, said Mark Chapman, Enverus senior vice president of oil-field-services intelligence.
Meanwhile, efficiency gains have stalled. Speed of drilling peaked at about 1,400 feet a day in the Midland side of the Permian Basin, Chapman said. And capital efficiency over the life of a development has been somewhat stagnant in recent years and fell more recently because of rising oil-field-service costs.
A concern for U.S. shale has been that, while the industry has gotten good at extracting oil, it has come at the cost of leaving some in the ground. If underground shale layers were analogous to a milkshake, the traditional method -- known as best-bench development -- involved extracting through one or a few straws first in a section and coming back later for more. While that yielded initial wells that were very productive, the problem was that the later wells were significantly less productive.
Cube development, also known as co-development, aims to fix that problem. It involves sticking several straws all around the figurative milkshake before extraction. While producers have used that method for many years, there were trials and errors on how those wells were spaced. The clear benefit is that, done correctly, producers can expect to extract more oil.
""Broadly speaking, most believe cube development yields higher total oil recovery than best-bench-first,"" Stephen Sagriff, senior vice president of intelligence at Enverus, wrote in an email. Sagriff noted about 60% of all development in the Permian has been under a cube-style development over the past few years.
Exxon Mobil is a vocal proponent: In its earnings call in October, the company estimated its cube-development method is yielding 30% to 50% higher net present value compared with a competitor using the best-bench approach in Martin County, Texas. It was part of Exxon's rationale for buying Pioneer Natural Resources. Exxon figures it can extract more hydrocarbons out of Pioneer's acreage using its own cube-development method.
Investors aren't totally sold on those lofty projections, especially because the oil major isn't seen as the best shale developer. Others using the approach include Diamondback Energy, which has been shifting to co-development since 2019. Diamondback went from drilling an average of about three wells per project in 2015 to 10 in 2019 and about 24 as of today, according to its investor presentation this month.
The downside of cube development is it costs more upfront, takes longer until production and involves substantial risk. In cube development, well spacing has to get quite dense for a producer to maximize the amount of oil from the life of the development. But place the wells a little too close, and that productivity potential dramatically falls.
As Tom Loughrey, president of energy-analytics company FLOW Partners, puts it: Optimizing recovery means a producer has to get ""fairly close to the edge"" of the point at which oil recovery suddenly drops off a cliff. This was what happened to some earlier cube projects, which failed to produce hydrocarbons as predicted because the wells weren't spaced far apart enough.
Not everyone buys the premise that cube development is more capital efficient over the life of a development. What is clear, is that only developers with deep pockets, patience and some risk tolerance can try it out. It may require a different kind of investor base. Loughrey notes that when Pioneer Natural Resources' wells started getting denser at the beginning of 2022, ""Wall Street didn't like it,"" and that the company subsequently started spacing their wells farther apart. He believes that Exxon is able to take on cube development because its investor base includes more thematic investors who aren't as laser-focused on quarter-by-quarter improvements in capital efficiency.
That some of the largest Permian developers are pursuing a capital-heavy, somewhat risky method suggests they are less confident about the number of gushers left in the shale patch and more confident about their investors' patience.

In the past month, two megadeals have been launched in the oil and gas industry: the announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources by ExxonMobil and Chevron's planned takeover of Hess.
In the Pioneer deal, Exxon will become the dominant operator in the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the US. And in acquiring Hess, Chevron will become one of the largest producers in the Bakken Formation (and gains a foothold in Guyana where Exxon already has a leading presence).
Both acquisitions were accompanied by triumphal announcements regarding the long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand, including Chevron's chief executive challenging the International Energy Agency's projections of a peak in fossil fuel demand in the next decade.
Yet the rationale for these transactions can be squared with either view of oil demand. For Exxon, in particular, expansion in the Permian offers a path to profitability even in significantly lower long-term fossil fuel demand scenarios, with estimated production costs of approximately $35 a barrel.
Permian shale patch production, which has a typically short cycle of development and exploitation, also offers the ability to flex production up and down more easily in response to changes in demand.
Megaprojects, by contrast, can take up to a decade to start producing and even longer to start generating a return.
This stands in marked contrast to Exxon's stance on capital allocation a couple of years ago, when I led a campaign with my former colleagues at Engine No. 1 to replace members of the oil group's board.
The company at that point had for years disregarded the market's preference for focusing on value over volumes ? and was instead setting capital expenditure levels by reference to market share rather than expected returns.
As a result, its shares had underperformed those of its peers for years, even before Covid-19. In fact, Exxon had spent so heavily that at the start of 2020, the estimated oil price required for its projects to break even was close to $90 ? almost 50 per cent higher than its closest peers, including Chevron.
At the time, there were also no independent directors with outside energy experience. This is why investors were open to change. They were under no illusion that Exxon would stop investing in oil and gas; in fact, in our first letter we noted ? just as Exxon's chief executive did in announcing the Pioneer deal ? that oil and gas companies must spend to offset natural decline rates.
But we also argued that Exxon should spend more intelligently to account for long-term demand uncertainty.
Specifically, we called for focusing on projects that would deliver a rate of return well above the company's cost of capital under a wider variety of longterm demand scenarios and we highlighted the Permian Basin ? as well as Guyana ? as meeting that criterion.
This is why, despite the public debate about the direction and speed of the energy transition, the real focus for oil and gas companies will continue to be around capital allocation in a time of uncertainty.
Exxon and Chevron may be right that oil and gas demand will grow far beyond the expectations of the IEA or the hopes of citizens wishing to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Recent events include a rise in interest rates and supply chain issues that have dented the economics of renewables while there's been minimal progress at the COP26 and 27 summits on climate change and, most likely, COP28, starting later this month in Dubai.
Exxon is also not wrong when it says it cannot move faster than the pace of the energy transition (leaving aside the matter of its historical role in slowing this transition), as other producers would simply pick up the slack.
Still, I believe that long-term investors continue to prefer Exxon to eschew a strategy of chasing market share without sufficient regard to returns, instead focusing on lower cost projects offering greater flexibility if the pace of the energy transition increases over time.
The stock market certainly does, with Exxon outperforming Chevron substantially since the former embraced a more disciplined capital allocation strategy during the proxy campaign.
With this acquisition, Exxon enhances its flexibility for the future.
However, it will be up to investors to again hold the company accountable should it return to a strategy rejected not just by those focused on climate change but those focused solely on shareholder returns as well.
Charlie Penner is a former partner at Jana Partners and the former head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1
Long-term investors continue to prefer focusing on lower cost projects offering greater flexibility

ExxonMobil remains on the hunt for deals even after unveiling its biggest transaction this century, the company said yesterday, as it and rival Chevron reported profits that fell short of Wall Street expectations.
The largest US oil company said this month it was buying Pioneer Natural Resources in a $60bn acquisition that fired the starting gun on an expected race to consolidate the sector.
Kathy Mikells, Exxon's chief financial officer, said the deal did not preclude the supermajor from striking again in the near term. ""It's important to say that we're always looking,"" she told the Financial Times. ""Many times I've described us as very inquisitive but also very picky. A deal has got to be what we say is 'one plus one equals three'.""
Chevron announced its own megadeal this week: a $53bn takeover of Hess that accelerates M&A in the sector. Pierre Breber, finance chief, declined to say whether more could follow. ""We're focused on this transaction,"" he said. ""It's a big transaction ... we'll focus on executing this one well.""
Exxon reported earnings of $9.1bn, down sharply from $19.7bn last year on the back of lower crude prices, but also shy of the $9.6bn expected by analysts, according to LSEG.
Chevron's earnings for the period of $6.5bn were down from $11.2bn a year ago and short of the $6.9bn pencilled in by analysts, according to LSEG. Surging oil prices last year pushed producers to record profits. Exxon's shares fell 2 per cent in early New York trading yesterday, while Chevron's dived 5.5 per cent.
Analysts and dealmakers expect more multibillion-dollar transactions as big producers aim to stock up on prime drilling spots they can exploit into the coming decades despite warnings that fossil fuel demand could peak by 2030.
""It's important to understand that we're in a depletion business with upstream,"" said Mikells. ""I think [the deal] puts us in a good position for the long term.""
Both companies have increased capital expenditure this year as they pursue growth. Exxon spent $18.6bn in the first nine months versus $15.2bn in 2022. Chevron's outlay over the period rose to $11.5bn from $8.1bn last year.

The latest Market Talks covering Energy and Utilities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.
1328 ET – The number of rigs drilling for oil and natural gas in the US rose by one this week, according to the latest survey by Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes' says that US rigs rose to 625 in the latest week. Meanwhile, the Canadian rig count is down by two rigs, to 196 rigs. In the US, an uptick of two oil rigs were partially offset by a one-rig decrease in North American gas rigs. Oil futures are mostly higher, with the WTI crude contract up 1.3% and Brent rising 1% to $87.91 a barrel. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1234 ET – Chevron CEO Mike Wirth acknowledged some investors asked executives whether the company paid too much in its $53 billion all-stock deal to takeover Hess, and that initially some tension arose in negotiations with CEO John Hess over the price tag. Likewise, some Hess investors have questioned whether Hess should have gotten a higher price, he said. ""John and I have been looking for a way to do a deal that is actually one that's good for both sets of shareholders and not easy,"" Wirth said. ""It's a great asset and the market recognizes that value."" Some investors, he said, may have held Chevron or Hess shares for other reasons or may have been surprised by the deal, but ultimately, he said many investors seem to ""see the long-term value creation."" ( collin.eaton@wsj.com ; @collineatonHC)
1224 ET – Chevron shares fall 5.9% as it announces further delays, cost increases and a reduction in its projected free cash flow at a joint-venture project to boost output at its massive Kazakhstan oil field. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth attributes projected cost increases to the complexities of its efforts to refurbish Soviet-era power infrastructure for the giant oil field. ""What became evident is we need to account for that complexity in our schedule, and I don't think it was fully reflected,"" Wirth said. The project is in its final commissioning phase. Chevron now expects its cost to increase 3% to 5%. ( collin.eaton@wsj.com ; @collineatonHC)
1048 ET – BP looks set to benefit from rising oil prices in third-quarter results on Tuesday Oct. 31, UBS says. ""We expect BP to report a sequentially better set of results thanks to higher oil prices and a rebound in [its customer & product business] after a weak 2Q,"" UBS analyst Henri Patricot writes, adding that the shares are already pricing in a refining margin rebound and stronger production driven by the US. ""Both UBS and consensus expectations are a flat q/q buyback at $1.5bn, with potential upside risk in the following quarters as [cash flows from operations] improve. BP's commitment to return 60% of surplus cash flows isn't expected to change."" Brent crude gains 0.7% to $87.69 a barrel. BP shares drop 0.8%. ( philip.waller@wsj.com )
1030 ET – Natural gas is up 2.4% this morning, with traders bidding futures higher ahead of colder weather forecasts. ""Natural Gas is catching a big bid ahead of the first real cold snap of the year next week, with temps below freezing in parts of the mid-continent, and lows in the 30s in New York City for the first time this fall,"" says Robert Yawger of Mizuho in a note. Temperatures are expected to stay low through next week, according to a weather forecast by agricultural research firm DTN. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1009 ET – Imperial Oil missed consensus expectations on cash flow due to weaker than expected refining margins and higher costs. Scotiabank analyst Jason Bouvier says in a report that 3Q cash-flow per share came in at C$3.36, missing consensus by 4%. ""This cash flow miss was driven by lower than expected refining margins and higher sales, general and administrative costs,"" he says. Shares are down 0.7% at C$80.64. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0945 ET – As more electric drilling rigs probe the sandy plains of the largest US oil patch, Exxon Mobil executives tell investors all of the 17 drilling rigs it is running in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico run on electricity. Neil Chapman, a senior vice president, said it's also working to move five of its six fracking fleets to electric operations, part of the company's effort to drive its greenhouse gas emissions down in the Permian. The company is working to secure renewable power sources to fuel its oil rigs, he says. ( collin.eaton@wsj.com ; @collineatonHC)
0942 ET – Crude oil futures are up 1.8% in early trading, responding to the first American military strikes in the growing Middle East conflict—this while markets wait for Israel to begin its anticipated ground war in Gaza. US officials say that strikes targeting two bases in eastern Syria it believed were used by Iranian groups, are meant to deter Iran's involvement in the conflict, and the market is concerned about potential supply disruptions. ""A US strike on a couple of Syrian bases is conjuring up ideas of expanded conflict into Iran that could prompt some actual supply disruptions via reduced production or disturbance of traffic through the Strait of Hormuz,"" says Ritterbusch and Associates in a note. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
0934 ET – Precision Drilling's Canadian growth trajectory sets it apart from peers, Keith Mackey of RBC says in a report. The analyst believes its Canadian rig market exposure is a differentiator for PD, and notes that the company remains sold out of its 29 super-triple rigs in Canada, with 68 total rigs running in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin and may even have the opportunity to bring underused rigs from the U.S. to Canada. At the same time, PD has 55%-60% market share in the Montney oil-producing region of Alberta, where Mackey sees long-term rig demand growth. ( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0933 ET – Exxon CEO Darren Woods says his chief low-carbon lieutenant Dan Ammann is exploring a business plan to develop lithium assets in Arkansas and that it's looking ""more and more promising."" The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year Exxon is planning to develop lithium assets in the Smackover region, including one of the world's largest lithium processing facilities, as it looks to apply its chemical expertise to move into a business Woods said will be critical to electrification and the energy transition. Woods said he expects lithium to become part of Exxon's portfolio. ( collin.eaton@wsj.com ; @collineatonHC)

0916 ET – CBOT grains have a boost pre-market, fueled in part by strength in crude oil prices ahead of the weekend. ""The outside markets this morning are positive with the equity and crude oil markets higher and the dollar trading either side of steady,"" says Tomm Pfitzenmaier of Summit Commodity Brokerage in a note. Pfitzenmaier adds that early buying has been fleeting for grains in recent sessions, making a higher close murky. How South American weather forecasts look as the day progresses are likely to influence trading throughout the day. Most-active corn is up 0.5%, soybeans rise 1.1%, and wheat is down 0.4%. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
0911 ET – Exxon executives say the company expects it could use its suite of existing oil-production technologies to extract 1 billion barrels of oil and gas more than either Pioneer Natural Resources or other shale companies could have done in Pioneer's acreage in the Permian Basin. Some investors have questioned some of Exxon's key claims about its $59.5 billion all-stock deal to buy Pioneer, including its ability to double the amount of oil and gas it can recover from shale wells. Neil Chapman, a senior vice president at Exxon, tells investors it will be able to demonstrate how its development plans will boost results once it moves into Pioneer's acreage, some of the best in the Permian.

Chevron said it would buy Hess in an all-stock deal worth $53 billion in the second major oil tie-up this month, after Exxon Mobil's deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources.
The U.S. energy company said buying Hess would upgrade and diversify its portfolio, marking Chevron's entrance into an Exxon-led partnership overseeing a generational oil find in Guyana, while picking up additional U.S. shale assets largely in North Dakota.
The transaction, less than two weeks after Exxon's acquisition of Pioneer, shows the U.S.'s second-largest oil company is similarly tying its future to a bet that the world will continue to have an appetite for oil for decades, even as many countries are seeking to cut emissions and transition toward green energy.
The major oil companies' doubling down on fossil fuels follows a recent prediction by the International Energy Agency that fossil-fuel demand globally would reach its zenith this decade.
""These are two great American companies coming together to be even stronger at a time when investment in American energy is important from the standpoint of jobs and from the standpoint of energy security,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview on Monday.
The deal values Hess at $171 a share based on Chevron's closing price on Friday, with Hess shareholders receiving 1.025 shares of Chevron for each Hess share. The price represents a premium of 4.9% from Hess's closing share price on Friday and 10.3% when compared with the stock's 20-day average price.
Hess shares closed down about 1% to $161.30 on Monday, while Chevron shares fell 3.7% to $160.68. Including debt, the transaction has a total enterprise value of $60 billion.
The deal comes as oil-and-gas companies are flush with cash after energy prices rocketed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with executives signaling they were ready to deploy their war chests at the deals table.
Hess has been led for decades by Chief Executive John Hess, who -- along with a few other shale executives -- has made the public case for bolstering domestic energy supplies. Hess is expected to join Chevron's board, Chevron said.
Hess, who owns about 9% of the eponymous company, led it to scoop up a large position early on in the American shale revolution, primarily in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.
The biggest prize for Chevron is Hess's nearly one-third share of the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and gas found off the shores of Guyana. Exxon and its partners, Hess and China's Cnooc, have revved up Guyana's oil production from nothing in 2019 to 400,000 barrels a day.
The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments. By then, the former British colony will be the source of $180 billion in market value for the consortium, some analysts have said.
Exxon Mobil earlier this month struck a nearly $60 billion agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades. Both Exxon and Chevron have also agreed on smaller transactions earlier this year.
On Monday, Wirth said the deal for Hess would position his company to strengthen its long-term performance and further enhance its portfolio. The combination is also expected to achieve cost synergies of around $1 billion before taxes within a year of closing, the company said. Wirth said the combined company should have an inventory of lucrative drilling locations into the next decade.
Wirth has become a vocal defender of the U.S. oil industry as fossil-fuel producers have come under scrutiny of the Biden administration, environmental groups and European governments for their contribution to climate change.
""I don't think this would in any way be read as not being supportive of a lower carbon future, but it also recognizes the reality that oil and gas are important today and will be for many, many years to come,"" Wirth said in the interview.
Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a climate-focused investment group, said Chevron's deal runs counter to the Paris climate agreement and that investors must exert more pressure on oil companies to reduce production.
Chevron's board of directors has said it would waive the company's fixed retirement age to allow Wirth to remain CEO for a longer period as it weighs its C-suite strategy. Wirth became CEO in 2018, when the company was reeling from years of cost overruns made more acute by an oil-market crash in 2015 and anemic energy prices. He was seen as an executive who could corral runaway costs.
In 2019, Wirth refused to enter into a bidding war when Occidental Petroleum swooped in to buy Anadarko Petroleum for billions more than Chevron had offered. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee and bought Noble Energy for a lower price the next year, a deal that gave the company access to Middle East natural-gas markets and a bigger U.S. footprint.
Wirth has touted his strategy since walking away from Anadarko to focus on acquisitions that offered low premiums to its targets, including its agreement in May to buy PDC Energy for more than $6 billion. Chevron's deal to buy Hess is its third since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 with a premium of around 10%, Chevron said.
Wirth said he expects Chevron will make a double-digit return on capital employed, a measure closely watched by investors, at midrange oil prices and would be prepared for an oil downturn, should one occur. Echoing other oil executives and analysts, Wirth said it is time that companies scale up via mergers and acquisitions.
""Ours is an industry, particularly as you get into the shale patch, that was due for some consolidation,"" Wirth said on a call with investors on Monday.
Chevron said it expected the Hess deal, which needs a green light from Hess shareholders as well as regulatory approvals, to close in the first half of 2024.

The latest Market Talks covering Energy and Utilities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.
1454 ET – Crude oil futures started a new front month, and finished the day down 2.9% to $85.49 a barrel. The pre-occupation of crude oil traders, as well as many commodity traders across the board, focused mostly on developments out of the Middle East. ""Crude oil prices are lower on fears that the Middle East war will prove to be a drag on the global economy,"" says Arlan Suderman of StoneX in a note. Brent Crude shed 2.5% to $89.83 a barrel. ( kirk.maltais@wsj.com ; @kirkmaltais)
1426 ET – Acquisitions among oil and gas producers are not going to dry up any time soon, say Truist analysts Neal Dingmann and Bertrand Donnes in a research note. Chevron's blockbuster $53 billion deal for Hess is the latest sign that companies are looking to drive operating efficiencies as new discoveries of oil reserves slow. They expect deals to continue to flow freely over the next few months. Companies including ConocoPhillips, Coterra Energy and Devon Energy stand to benefit most from greater scale, the analysts say, while smaller players such as Civitas Resources and Permian Resources look like potential acquisition targets. ( ben.glickman@wsj.com ; @benglickman)
1111ET – Petroleo Brasileiro's proposed new remuneration fund may give the state-controlled oil company more flexibility to pay, or not pay, future extraordinary dividends, Citi Research analyst Gabriel Barra says in a research note. Petrobras needs to get shareholder approval to establish the fund and make other proposed changes to its bylaws. The proposed changes to its policy for appointing senior management and members of its fiscal council are negative, Barra says. Citi maintained its neutral rating for the stock, saying there's no material asymmetry between it and its main global peers. ( jeffrey.lewis@wsj.com )
1044 ET – Europa Oil & Gas gains 4% after the U.K. & Ireland-focused producer and explorer reported higher annual production. Net production in the year to the end of July increased 8% to 265 barrels of oil per day, versus 245 bopd in 2022, driven by what the AIM-listed company described as an excellent performance at its U.K. onshore Wressle field. ""EOG moves forward, albeit at slow pace,"" Panmure Gordon analyst Ashley Kelty says in a note. ""Wressle continues to perform and this should provide stable revenues over the near- to medium-term."" ( philip.waller@wsj.com )
1017 ET – The all-stock takeover of Hess by Chevron instantly rewards Hess investors with a richer dividend. Chevron's current annual dividend rate of $6.04 offers a yield of roughly 3.7% based on Monday's trading price of $163.23, and the energy giant says it plans to raise its payout by 8% in January to $6.52, which would equate to a current yield of nearly 4%. Hess, meanwhile, pays annual dividends of $1.75, for a current yield of just over 1%. Hess up 0.8% to $164.45. ( colin.kellaher@wsj.com )
0801 ET – While Chevron's $53 billion deal to buy Hess represents a scant 5% premium based on Friday's closing prices, Hess shares had already rallied this month following Exxon Mobil's blockbuster deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. Hess shares closed at $145.65 on Oct. 6, before reports surfaced that Exxon and Pioneer were closing in on an agreement. Based on that price, Chevron's $171-a-share deal represents a 17% premium for Hess, roughly in line with the 19% Exxon/Pioneer premium on the same basis. Hess shares edge up 0.5% premarket to $163.83; Chevron shares down 2.9% to $162.05. ( colin.kellaher@wsj.com )
0756 ET – Tullow Oil looks set to benefit from production increases and rising oil prices, Jefferies says, upgrading the Africa-focused operator to hold from under-perform. Refinancing risk of Tullow's remaining $633 million of 2025 bonds looks more reasonably priced-in given improved production at the company's Jubilee field off the coast of Ghana, Jefferies says. Rising commodity prices are also continuing to boost industry balance sheets, Jefferies analyst Mark Wilson says in a note, increasing the brokerage's price target on Tullow's shares to 35 pence from 25 pence. Still, the stock drops 0.5% to 33 pence as Brent crude falls 0.3% to $91.89 a barrel, with most other major European-listed oil stocks also trading lower. ( philip.waller@wsj.com )
0754 ET – With the sale of its non-core Cardium assets, Tamarack Valley Energy has freed itself to better focus on important projects and return more capital to its investors, RBC's Luke Davis says in a report. The C$123-million sale of assets ""has strong strategic merit despite discounted multiples given it concentrates production to core plays, improves corporate netbacks and breakevens, and accelerates return on capital,"" he says. Davis also says he expects the company to reach its first net debt threshold of $1.1B at the deal's close, triggering a 25% free cash return program.( adriano.marchese@wsj.com )
0658 ET – Chevron says it expects its production growth rate will be higher than its current guidance and that it can be sustained for longer after its $53 billion acquisition of Hess. With the deal, Chevron says it will have added significant reserve and resource positions in the DJ Basin, Eastern Mediterranean, Bakken and Guyana, to its positions in Australia, Kazakhstan, Permian Basin and offshore Gulf of Mexico since walking away from the 2019 takeover battle for Anadarko. Chevron says it expects to focus more than 75% of its upstream capex on those eight areas, adding that it will provide updated production guidance after it develops a post-closing business plan. Chevron down 3.3% premarket to $161.40. ( colin.kellaher@wsj.com )
0627 ET – Chevron's shares fall 3.2% in premarket trading after the oil giant agreed to buy oil-and-gas producer Hess Corporation in a $53 billion all-stock deal. The acquisition, which is set to upgrade and diversify Chevron's portfolio, comes after ExxonMobil struck a nearly $60 billion agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources earlier this month. Hess shares rise 1.9%. ( giulia.petroni@wsj.com )
0619 ET – While Chevron is using $53 billion of its stock as currency to buy smaller peer Hess, the energy giant says it still plans to prioritize returning money to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends. Chevron says it expects to boost its first-quarter dividend by 8% to $1.63, backed by immediate free cash flow from its August acquisition of PDC Energy and longer-term projected free cash flow growth from Hess. Chevron, which ended Friday's session with a market capitalization topping $318 billion, also says its plans to up its buyback spending to the top of its $20 billion annual guidance, or $5 billion a quarter, after the closing of the Hess deal and the end of repurchase restrictions under SEC regulations.

Chevron's $60 billion deal for Hess isn't what investors may have expected even after Exxon Mobil agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in another enormous energy-sector merger.
Three surprising points stand out: The small takeover premium, the use of stock as currency for the transaction, and the fact that Hess has no exposure to the Permian Basin, the hottest region of U.S. oil and gas development. Yet there is a logic behind each of those elements.
Chevron (ticker: CVX) said early Monday that it reached a deal t o purchase Hess (HES), an independent oil-and-gas company, in an all-stock deal that initially values Hess at $171 a share. That is a roughly 5% premium to Hess's closing price of $163.02 on Friday.
Despite that modest figure and the fact that Chevron will be returning more capital to shareholders, Wall Street doesn't seem thrilled that Chevron will be issuing 317 million shares, about 17% of its outstanding stock, for a company that isn't a must-have asset.
Hess shares were down 0.2% to $162.66 Monday, while Chevron shares had fallen 2.4% to $162.83. Trust analyst Neal Dingmann cut his price target on Chevron to $169 a share from $175 while maintaining a Hold rating. He cited ""near-term dilution"" to Chevron from the transaction—a negative factor that is partly offset by the fact that the company also said it plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.63 a share in January.
MORE M&A Must-Reads
That would result in a yield of about 4% at the current share price, more than the 3.3% current yield on Exxon. Chevron also said Monday it increased its target for stock repurchases by $2.5 billion to $20 billion annually, which should result in a total yield—dividends plus buybacks—of about 10% annually.
One reason for Chevron's stock-price drop Monday is arbitrage pressure as arbitragers buy Hess and sell short Chevron to lock in a spread.
The transaction, due to close in the first half of 2024, follows Exxon's $59.5 billion deal earlier this month for Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). The mergers show that the two biggest U.S. energy companies—Exxon and Chevron—are keen on the oil and gas business in a bet that fossil fuels will be a critical source of global energy for decades to come.
With a premium of 5%—10% above the Hess's average stock price for the 20 days ended on Friday—Chevron appears to be paying up less generously than Exxon has agreed to in the Pioneer transaction. Exxon offered an 18% premium above Pioneer's stock price about a week before the deal announcement.
One reason that Hess may have accepted the low premium is that the deal is all-stock and therefore tax efficient, which may have appealed to the Hess family, led by CEO John Hess. The family owns about 10% of Hess stock. They and other Hess shareholders effectively get to diversify their investment into the much larger and financially stronger Chevron, which has a much higher dividend yield than Hess's 1%.
Both Chevron and Exxon are using all stock for their deals, reflecting financial conservatism among big oil companies.
""If you put cash in upfront, then you're setting yourselves up where you might not have a stable deal,"" Chevron CFO Pierre Breber told Barron's on Monday morning. ""If oil prices rise, obviously, the acquirer wins. If they fall, the seller would win. You're trying to set a deal structure that works for both parties. And we're in an industry where oil prices can move quite a bit up or down.""
Still, Chevron has a great balance sheet, with just $12 billion of net debt (debt less cash) against a market value of about $310 billion and projected earnings this year after taxes of over $25 billion. Chevron could easily have done a deal offering half cash and half stock that would dilute existing shareholders less and be more accretive to earnings.
Chevron is using a currency—its stock—that trades for just 12 times this year's estimated earnings, to buy a company that is valued at 35 times this year's profits.
Analysts were mildly surprised that Chevron decided to do a deal with a company without significant complementary assets, unlike Exxon's merger with Pioneer, which combined two major Permian players. But Chevron's view is that it has a big exposure to the Permian already and doesn't need any more.
Hess's crown jewel and the source of most of its value is a 30% stake in an offshore oil field in Guyana that holds the equivalent of more than 11 billion barrels of crude. That project is ramping up and now produces more than 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. It could produce about 800,000 barrels by 2027, according to Exxon, which is the largest owner and the operator of the project
The Guyana field is one of the best in the world due to its size and low cost of production. Like any international project, though, it carries the risk that the host country may seek to modify the terms of the deal to make it less favorable to international oil companies.
""Guyana has, to date, been an extraordinarily well-run exploration and development programme by the operator; it is difficult to see what Chevron can bring to the table to enhance the value further,"" wrote Citi analyst Scott Gruber in a client note Monday.
Analysts said that with little overlap between the two companies, there likely won't be any antitrust problems. Still, both the Chevron-Hess and Exxon-Pioneer deals are large, and Biden administration regulators, particularly Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, have been generally hostile to big mergers.

The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments. By then, the former British colony will be the source of $180 billion in market value for the consortium, some analysts have said.
Exxon Mobil earlier this month struck a nearly $60 billion agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades. Both Exxon and Chevron have also agreed on smaller transactions earlier this year.
On Monday, Wirth said the deal for Hess would position his company to strengthen its long-term performance and further enhance its portfolio. The combination is also expected to achieve cost synergies of around $1 billion before taxes within a year of closing, the company said. Wirth said the combined company should have an inventory of lucrative drilling locations into the next decade.
Wirth has become a vocal defender of the U.S. oil industry as fossil-fuel producers have come under scrutiny of the Biden administration, environmental groups and European governments for their contribution to climate change.
""I don't think this would in any way be read as not being supportive of a lower carbon future, but it also recognizes the reality that oil and gas are important today and will be for many, many years to come,"" Wirth said in the interview.
Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a climate-focused investment group, said Chevron's deal runs counter to the Paris climate agreement and that investors must exert more pressure on oil companies to reduce production.
Chevron's board of directors has said it would waive the company's fixed retirement age to allow Wirth to remain CEO for a longer period as it weighs its C-suite strategy. Wirth became CEO in 2018, when the company was reeling from years of cost overruns made more acute by an oil-market crash in 2015 and anemic energy prices. He was seen as an executive who could corral runaway costs.
In 2019, Wirth refused to enter into a bidding war when Occidental Petroleum swooped in to buy Anadarko Petroleum for billions more than Chevron had offered. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee and bought Noble Energy for a lower price the next year, a deal that gave the company access to Middle East natural-gas markets and a bigger U.S. footprint.
Wirth has touted his strategy since walking away from Anadarko to focus on acquisitions that offered low premiums to its targets, including its agreement in May to buy PDC Energy for more than $6 billion. Chevron's deal to buy Hess is its third since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 with a premium of around 10%, Chevron said.
Wirth said he expects Chevron will make a double-digit return on capital employed, a measure closely watched by investors, at midrange oil prices and would be prepared for an oil downturn, should one occur. Echoing other oil executives and analysts, Wirth said it is time that companies scale up via mergers and acquisitions.
""Ours is an industry, particularly as you get into the shale patch, that was due for some consolidation,"" Wirth said on a call with investors on Monday.
Chevron said it expected the Hess deal, which needs a green light from Hess shareholders as well as regulatory approvals, to close in the first half of 2024.
Wirth and Hess said they don't foresee regulatory issues in closing the deal. They expected Guyana's government to continue to honor a production-sharing agreement it had struck with the consortium, and they see approval from U.S. antitrust regulators, who have taken a close look at large corporate acquisitions under the Biden administration.
""In the global crude market, we're a small player,"" Wirth said on the call.
Chevron also said Monday that it would boost returns to shareholders. The company said it expects to increase its first-quarter dividend by 8% in January and plans to increase share repurchases.
Energy companies have reported lower results this year after record-setting levels last year, but are still reporting big profits because of elevated commodity prices. Chevron is to report its third-quarter earnings on Friday.
Hess was founded in 1933 by John Hess's father Leon, the former owner of the New York Jets football team. Hess said his company's legacy began about 90 years ago with his father ""delivering fuel oil in a secondhand truck during the Depression.""
In recent years the company has sold off some assets in various countries to focus on its core operations. It is also known for its sale of toy trucks around Christmas, a tradition that Hess and Wirth said on Monday would continue.

Scott Sheffield transformed Pioneer Natural Resources from a fledgling outfit into one of the largest oil producers in West Texas and, until recently, put no limits on his ambition to grow.
But after two weeks of negotiations, he agreed to sell his company for $60 billion to Exxon Mobil last week, the oil giant he had lapped for years in the Permian Basin.
Sheffield's shift signals that even the largest independent drillers face an uncertain path to making it on their own and has some calling an end to an era dominated by scrappy frackers.
""It's probably a bittersweet Grand Slam,"" Andrew Cates, a former Pioneer board member, said of the deal. ""Pioneer has been an independent, and been very proud of it.""
Sheffield, 71 years old, started buying leases in the Permian in the '90s as chief executive of Parker & Parsley Petroleum, his father-in-law's oil company. When he merged the driller with T. Boone Pickens's Mesa to form Pioneer in 1997, the company produced fewer than 100,000 barrels of oil and gas a day.
By staying focused on the Permian, then a languid oil basin deserted by Exxon and other major oil companies, Sheffield found himself in the driver's seat to rapidly expand once-new drilling techniques, and hydraulic fracturing unlocked vast reserves of oil and gas there. Pioneer produced about 711,000 barrels of oil and gas a day in the Permian in the second quarter of the year, topping Exxon's production there of less than 650,000.
Pioneer had recently been considering a long-term strategy to diversify outside of the Permian, Sheffield said in an interview, including by potentially expanding into other basins or going international.
""We've probably looked at 50 opportunities over the last five years,"" Sheffield said.
Instead, he will be watching the oil patch's makeover from Exxon's boardroom, where he is set to gain a seat following the acquisition. Sheffield declined to say why he sold the company instead of trying to grow further.
""I want you to know this is not a decision the board made lightly,"" Sheffield wrote in a memo sent to Pioneer employees last week. ""It is certainly not a decision I have made lightly either. This company, and all of you, have been at the center of my life for nearly 45 years.""
Sheffield is set to receive a nearly $30 million payout following the acquisition and is entitled to roughly $13 million from a separate retirement package. More than $140 million worth of Pioneer stock Sheffield owns will also roll into Exxon shares, a stock considered as good as cash, investment bankers said.
The sale augurs an era in which oil behemoths scoop up smaller rivals and commandeer a bigger share of U.S. crude production. Sheffield himself has predicted that frackers running out of sweet spots will be subsumed into larger companies if they are to survive.
Large public companies such as Exxon have been leaning into the Permian to build more reserves closer to home, bringing their technological savvy and pricing power to a well-delineated field where resources are becoming scarce.
""It's time for the guys with the best balance sheets, and Exxon has the best,"" said Mike Wichterich, CEO of Permian driller Three Rivers Operating.
When frackers started deploying horizontal drilling and fracking in West Texas and hit gushers, Sheffield met with investors to tout the technologies and their potential to unleash a torrent of crude, said Leigh Goehring, a managing partner at investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg. Sheffield had snapped up some of the best drilling spots there and laid out bold plans.
""He had the core of the core,"" said Goehring, whose firm is a Pioneer investor.
The son of an oil executive, Sheffield attended high school in Tehran and went on to study prelaw at the University of Texas at Austin, where he did ""too much of everything but studying,"" he told students there in 2016. After he flunked out, his father put him on an offshore drilling rig for six months. He returned to UT to graduate as a petroleum engineer and worked for Amoco as a reservoir engineer before joining Parker & Parsley.
Sheffield soon emerged as a shale chieftain, promoting the industry's role in meeting America's energy needs as the U.S. grew to become the world's largest producer. He faced skepticism from some on Wall Street, including hedge-fund manager David Einhorn, who described cash-burning drillers as being ""addicted to frack"" and made the case publicly for shorting Pioneer's stock.
Sheffield retired in 2016 after successfully lobbying Congress to lift a ban on crude exports that left gushing production stranded within domestic borders.
In 2019, Pioneer's board brought Sheffield back as CEO after his successor struggled to reach aggressive growth targets, which collided with investors' demand that frackers stop burning more cash than they made.
Sheffield embarked on a listening tour, speaking with over 150 employees and investors. He cut more than one-quarter of Pioneer's workforce in part through layoffs and buyouts as he sought to convince investors that the company could live within its means.
""Capital -- focusing on that is just as important as delivering on the production side of the business,"" he told analysts in an earnings call upon returning.
Pandemic lockdowns and oil prices cratering in 2020 bankrupted dozens of shale companies. With a strengthened balance sheet, Pioneer was in a good position to nab rivals and in 2021 it made back-to-back acquisitions of Permian drillers DoublePoint Energy and Parsley Energy -- the latter owned by Sheffield's son Bryan, one of five children -- for $11 billion combined.
Pioneer in recent years looked at acquiring driller Diamondback Energy, as well as making investments in Canada's oil sands, former employees said.
In 2021, Sheffield gathered his team to discuss a potential takeover of Cabot Oil & Gas, a driller active mostly in a large natural-gas region of Appalachia, they said. He deployed his long-practiced method of first asking everyone's opinion, a lesson he learned after realizing that when he spoke first everybody else shut down. The team pushed back against the idea of a deal, and Sheffield abandoned it.
Pioneer's aborted ambitions signal that even the largest independent drillers might struggle to compete with larger competitors as resources become scarce in U.S. basins. Producers may have no other choice than to step into other regions in the hopes of unlocking new resources, or to sell themselves, analysts and bankers said.
Pioneer had recently been making moves that made it an attractive target for a prospective buyer.
With the war in Ukraine lifting oil prices in 2022, Pioneer's stock price skyrocketed, crossing $233 for the first time since 2014. Pioneer showered investors with cash by returning most of its free cash flow to investors via a base dividend, a variable dividend and share repurchases. Recently, Pioneer gave itself more flexibility to buy back its own stock.
""These were near-term value drivers that would help the stock price in any potential M&A,"" said Kevin MacCurdy, an analyst at financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners.
Sheffield said that Pioneer hadn't been for sale until Exxon CEO Darren Woods approached him to negotiate two weeks before the deal was announced.
Woods recently flew to Santa Fe, N.M., to discuss the deal with Sheffield, who owns a sprawling ranch in the region, according to people familiar with the matter.
Sheffield, a vocal commentator on the state of global crude markets and shale, said that he couldn't comment on the prospects for more consolidation in the oil patch until the sale has been approved by the government. He said that he planned to remain outspoken as an Exxon board member.
""I hope that Exxon will allow me to speak my opinion,"" he said.

Spotlight
Scott Sheffield Chief executive, Pioneer Natural Resources
When Scott Sheffield began working for Parker & Parsley as a petroleum engineer in 1979, he joined a company trying to make a go of a west Texas drilling play once dubbed ""the graveyard of the oilman's hopes"".
That was not Sheffield's fate. This week he flipped the company, which later became Pioneer Natural Resources, to ExxonMobil for nearly $60bn in the US oil industry's biggest transaction in decades.
In the past decade, Pioneer has helped revive the moribund Permian Basin of Texas into a critical source of energy supply.
""We took something people thought was uneconomical and turned it [into] probably the largest oil and gas basin,"" Sheffield, 71, said. ""When you include all the natural gas and the natural gas liquids with the oil, it's as big as Saudi Arabia.""
No one embodies the wild ride the US oil patch has been through in recent decades more than Sheffield, a plain-talking Texan.
The Exxon deal draws a line under a long career that has spanned upheavals in the industry including two Opec price wars and an unprecedented crash in crude prices to below zero in 2020, as well as the emergence of climate change as a fundamental concern for investors.
As US crude production soared, Sheffield was a leading voice in the drive to lift the country's longstanding curbs on exports in 2015. He became a symbol of the industry's profligacy during the height of the shale drilling boom and later led the charge to rein in the sector's spending to appease an irate Wall Street.
People who have worked with Sheffield describe him as a hands-on chief executive, a fierce competitor and outspoken on big issues. That set him apart from the more staid leaders of the industry.
""Scott had a somewhat unique position in the sense that he bridged the world between the smaller independent, because that's what he started as, and the major oil company, because that's what he became,"" said Bobby Tudor, founder and chief executive of investment and advisory group Artemis Energy Partners.
Sheffield has worked in almost every facet of the oil industry. After initially flunking out of the University of Texas in the early 1970s for what he described as doing ""too much of everything but studying"", his father sent him to work on an offshore drilling rig for six months.
""Let's just say it didn't take long for me to realise that a college degree is very important,"" he told students at the university during a speech in 2016.
Sheffield later returned to university, switched courses to study petroleum engineering, graduated and joined oil company Amoco Production in Odessa, Texas. After joining Parker & Parsley, he rose to become its chief executive a decade later. In 1997 he merged the group with rival Mesa Petroleum to create Pioneer.
The company became a leader in the shale revolution that unfolded as enterprising wildcatters employed hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques to blast open previously unreachable oil and gas. US oil production rose from about 5mn barrels a day in 2008 to 13mn b/d this year.
As Pioneer and other frackers spent billions of dollars on drilling, Wall Street grew weary of their mounting losses. Pioneer was singled out as the embodiment of the industry's profligacy by hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who dubbed the company the ""motherfracker"".
Sheffield said: ""We were definitely overspending. So in a way, I think you can say he was right. But he shorted us and he was wrong on the short, because we all changed.""
As investors fled the oil patch, Sheffield in 2019 returned to Pioneer after a brief retirement as a champion of a new model of capital discipline. Gone were the days of debt-fuelled drilling binges and in their place was a focus on shareholder returns.
When the pandemic crushed oil prices in 2020, Sheffield was among the oil bosses who pleaded with Texas regulators to intervene to limit oil production in the state in a bid to rescue the shale industry.
Sheffield said at the time: ""It has been an economic disaster, especially the last 10 years. Nobody wants to give us capital because we have all destroyed capital and created economic waste."" He warned that without state action, the local oil industry might not survive.
But he took advantage of the downturn, snapping up rival Permian producers Parsley Energy and Double Point Energy in 2021 in deals worth a combined $11bn. The acquisitions made the company the biggest producer in the basin and in Texas.
The acquisition of Parsley Energy led to a large payout for Sheffield's son Bryan, who founded it in 2008, and caused some controversy. In an interview at the time, the elder Sheffield insisted that he and his son had been ""completely walled off"" from any negotiations.
Sheffield in April announced his second retirement before his final act. Selling Pioneer to ExxonMobil will earn him $29mn, according to regulatory filings. He will also receive about $150mn in Exxon stock in exchange for his Pioneer shares and join the supermajor's board as a director.
The deal came quickly. ""The company was not for sale,"" said Sheffield. ""If you asked me four weeks ago, there was nothing happening. They came with an offer in the last two to three weeks. And we negotiated.""
As he steps off the stage for the second time, industry observers question whether this marks the end of Sheffield's career. The last time he retired, throwing himself into charity work and climbing Kilimanjaro did not dim his attraction to the industry.
""Scott's been in the thick of it for a very long time. He couldn't stay away the last time and came back from retirement,"" said Dan Pickering, founder of Pickering Energy Partners, an investment group. ""Is sitting on the board of Exxon going to chafe the crap out of him? It's a lot different to running your own company. Maybe we could see him back at some stage."" Myles McCormick and Jamie Smyth'Is sitting on [Exxon's] board going to chafe the crap out of him? It's a lot different to running your own company'

In 2021, Darren Woods suffered a humbling defeat. A little-known activist investor convinced shareholders to give it three seats on the board of the oil behemoth he helms, Exxon Mobil, attacking his big spending and strategy for the shift to green energy.
Following the loss, Woods told investors the company had heard their criticisms. The oil boss slashed costs, hired senior executives from outside the company, and committed Exxon to a $17 billion five-year plan to cut emissions and build a 'low carbon' business.
But Woods, 58, didn't pivot Exxon away from fossil fuels, making his largest investments in production and maintaining his conviction that Exxon is, and will remain, an oil company.
A little more than two years later, Woods is riding high and cementing his commitment to oil. On Wednesday, Exxon said it would buy West Texas shale giant Pioneer Natural Resources for nearly $60 billion, Exxon's biggest deal since its merger with Mobil in 1999.
Exxon's full board of directors, including those who were nominated by the activist investor, Engine No. 1, voted in favor of the deal, a generational gamble on the future of oil.
In meetings prior to the Pioneer deal, Woods told some of the company's largest shareholders, including BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, Capital Group and others, that he was right about oil, according to people familiar with the matter. He has reminded some that they voted against the oil company in the proxy fight with Engine No. 1, only to see the company's profits surge to a record $56 billion last year on the back of Exxon's continued investment in production.
""We leaned in when others weren't,"" Woods has said during some of the investor meetings.

Woods, who joined Exxon in 1992 as a planning analyst in New Jersey, said he didn't seek out or even want the top job, or the attention that came with it.
He rose through the company's refining business, eventually leading it in the early 2010s. He also spent time in Exxon's investor-relations unit, learning how to translate oil-and-gas industry jargon for a well-heeled audience.
Born in Wichita, Kan., Woods spent his youth near various U.S. military bases, moving around the world due to his father's work as a military supplier. He played football at his Texas high school. He followed his high-school sweetheart, now his wife, to Texas A&M and earned a degree in electrical engineering. Later, he got an M.B.A. at Northwestern University. The couple has three children.
As head of the largest western oil company, Woods bears little resemblance to the boot-wearing, oil-stained wildcatters of Texas. He is also starkly different from his predecessor, Rex Tillerson, a plain-spoken Texas oilman.
Woods was chosen for the job because he represented a change in direction, as a scrupulous oil-refining executive who could wring cash out of a tight-margin business and spoke the language of Wall Street.
In the years before the pandemic, Woods's strategy took shape. Exxon made large investments in ambitious and costly projects in oil and gas simultaneously. At the time, investors said they thought Woods spent little time with investors explaining the strategy.
By 2021, his leadership was under attack. Exxon was laid low by the pandemic, posting a record $22 billion loss in 2020. A majority of investors, long put off by Exxon's perceived arrogance and limited engagement, did the unthinkable and supported Engine No. 1's slate.
San Francisco-based Engine No. 1, a firm launched by investment veteran Chris James in late 2020, has since worked with some oil companies on efforts to reduce methane emissions. James has advocated oil companies drill in U.S. shale rather than pump cash into costly long-term projects.
Following the defeat, Woods acknowledged his company needed to better explain itself to its investors and the outside world. He personally courted the company's largest shareholders, breaking with the aloofness of predecessors Tillerson and Lee Raymond.
But, somewhat unpopularly, Woods contended the oil industry wasn't pumping enough capital into fossil fuels to sustain global production and meet demand that would come roaring back once lockdowns lifted. Long-term demand for oil wasn't even close to rolling over, he said.
Woods expected a supply gap to emerge, and wanted to position Exxon to catch the windfall when it arrived.
It eventually did. Oil and gas prices surged once economies reopened and Russia invaded Ukraine, and Exxon raked in more than every other publicly traded American company that year except Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet.
Jay Hooley, Exxon's lead independent director, said the boardroom debates and discussions about how to deal with the company's crisis in 2021 galvanized directors, who ultimately chose to support Woods's plans to make countercyclical investments, which were unpopular then.
""When you face a crisis, it brings everybody to the table to focus on the crisis and how we effectively move through it,"" said Hooley, a former CEO of State Street. ""That was the galvanizing point.""
With a supportive board, Woods has been making big bets on deals and technology.
In Irving, Texas last spring, at Exxon's former headquarters an office building designed to telegraph the company's global reach with Anigre wood paneling from Africa, granite columns from Madagascar and a lobby floor of French limestone, Woods explained a high-level plan to investors for Exxon to do something companies have unsuccessfully striven to do for years: boost the amount of oil they can recover from individual shale wells.
Investors had little appetite for boosting investments to increase shale production, but Woods was talking about a way to use technological advances to wring more oil out of stubborn shale rock, according to people familiar with the meeting. Woods said he had directed employees to make it happen, and seemed confident in the plan.
Ultimately, that became one reason Exxon snapped up a large oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico: It needed a bigger sandbox for its experiments, and expected to extract more oil than its smaller rivals would on their own.
Strategies put forward by other oil companies during the pandemic to pivot from fossil fuels haven't fared as well. At Shell, recently appointed CEO Wael Sawan has backpedaled on his predecessor's plan to ease oil production and raised the company's profit threshold for clean-energy projects.
Former BP CEO Bernard Looney, who resigned last month over past relationships with colleagues, had recently planned to curtail elements of the company's push into renewable energy.
Woods's strategy faced internal challenges as well. Among Engine No. 1's three directors, shareholders elected Alexander Karsner, an executive at Alphabet's innovation lab, who was particularly adamant that Woods reshape the company to address climate change.
As time went on, and Exxon's profits turned around, Karsner and other new directors, including Greg Goff, the former CEO of Tesoro, became more supportive of Woods' plans. They now credit the CEO's push to make countercyclical investments with some of the company's recent success, according to people familiar with the matter.
Charles Penner, who led Engine No. 1's campaign against Exxon, said the proposed acquisition of Pioneer shows Exxon had heard some of the campaign's critiques and changed its approach to focus on returns instead of costly megaprojects more dependent on long-term demand.
""Nothing is perfect but this is better, and fits within realistic but still lower long-term demand scenarios,"" Penner said.
Some analysts say Woods merely benefited from a well-timed surge in oil and natural-gas prices, after Western sanctions on Russia squeezed global supplies and fuel-making margins rocketed to record heights in the U.S., where Exxon has several oil refineries.
Whatever the reason for Exxon's recent success, investors have piled into the stock. Before the Pioneer deal, Exxon's share price hit record highs in late September.
Exxon's management team continues to show friendlier face to investors and has held more open—and more frequent—meetings with them. Woods has also tried to change the company's insular and conservative image, making rare outside hires for key roles including the company's first female finance chief, Kathy Mikells.
Together, Mikells and Woods have looked more closely at the financial feasibility of various oil-and-gas projects and the company's cost of capital. Executives and directors more frequently hear out lower-level executives and more closely examine the company's talent pool while also raising the bar for new oil projects, people familiar with the matter said.
Woods, along with the board and management team, remains focused on protecting the company from ever again becoming vulnerable to attacks by activist investors, according to people familiar with the matter.
Meanwhile, Exxon is scouring the globe for new places to invest. It is looking closely at Southeastern Asia, the Middle East and the Gulf Coast to build its next chemical plant. Exxon has also looked to lock up new exploration deals in countries like Algeria. In Guyana, it approved some $40 billion in oil projects that are set to come online over the next few years.
Woods said Exxon is in a ""depletion business,"" in which it eventually has to replace the oil it pumps or decline as a company.
""Eventually that depletion catches up to you and you start to decline not only from a production standpoint but from a cash flow and returns standpoint,"" Woods said in an interview Wednesday.

ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods has long contended that oil and gas will remain central to the world's energy mix despite efforts to drive down emissions created by burning them. This week he placed a $60bn bet on this proposition.
The US energy supermajor's $59.5bn deal to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources will make it the dominant producer in the oil and gas-drenched Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
Tacking on Pioneer will immediately double Exxon's Permian production to 1.3mn barrels of oil equivalent per day. The combined acreage will further drive their output in the basin to about 2mn b/d by 2027. All told, Exxon will have access to 16bn oil-equivalent barrels, with 15 to 20 years of remaining inventory.
It is an audacious wager at a time when the International Energy Agency asserts that global demand for fossil fuels will peak before 2030, and must fall sharply in order to avoid the worst effects of global warming.
""It's a massive oil deal that demonstrates ExxonMobil's bullishness on longish-term oil demand and prices,"" said Tom Ellacott, an analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
By 2050, the company anticipates oil and gas will still make up more than half of global energy demand based on rapid growth of the global middle class and a slower transition to greener forms of energy. It said in a recent report that the world was likely to fail to keep global temperature rises below 2C from preindustrial levels, the target set by the Paris climate agreement.
Wednesday's announcement of Exxon's biggest deal since its 1999 merger with Mobil prompted a furious reaction from some environmental campaigners, who accused the company of ""doubling down"" on fossil fuels.
""This is really Exxon telling the world: we don't think the Paris climate agreement will ever be achieved. We'll buy more assets and we're going to fight tooth and nail to prevent the Paris climate agreement's achievement,"" said Mark van Baal of Follow This, a Dutch shareholder activist group.
Just over two years ago, Exxon's commitment to invest heavily in oil and gas helped fuel a shareholder rebellion at Exxon, with activist hedge fund Engine
No. 1 winning three board seats with a demand that it take climate change more seriously. Exxon has said it is investing billions in low-carbon businesses, such as carbon capture and storage, but remains committed to helping meet future energy demand.
""As long as the world needs oil and gas, we'll all be focused on making sure that they have the most efficient, effective and responsible operator making and producing oil and gas, and doing it with the lowest carbon intensity,"" Woods said on Wednesday.
Exxon's peers in Europe, such as BP and Shell, have sold parts of their fossil fuel portfolios in response to climate concerns. Both companies have cut oil output since 2019.
In the US, rival supermajor Chevron spent $6.3bn to acquire US shale producer PDC Energy, adding new oil and gas reserves to its portfolio. Analysts have speculated Exxon's deal for Pioneer would heighten the pressure on Chevron to pursue M&A in the Permian to remain competitive.
Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Chevron was in quite a strong position because Exxon's appetite for Permian assets would have been sated with Pioneer.
He said the deal made sense in terms of boosting efficiency and ensuring the company had resources that could plug into its large refining and chemicals assets on the Gulf coast.
Exxon pointed to Pioneer acreage in the eastern portion of the Permian Basin that abutted its own, enabling it to wring efficiencies from its drilling programme, including horizontal wells that extend as much as four miles though strata of oil-rich rock. It aims to cut its average cost per barrel in the Permian to less than $35 — a fraction of the current west Texas oil price of about $83.
""It's a win-win for the country, a better, stronger US economy and better energy security,"" Woods told reporters.
Exxon expects global production to decline by about 5 to 7 per cent a year to 2050, making ""sustained investment essential to offset depletion"" as consumption remains elevated.
The company plans to ramp up growth in the Permian as it also invests heavily in new production off the coast of Guyana, where it made a massive discovery in 2015, which has now increased to a resource of more than 10mn barrels of oil equivalent.
""Exxon has the real luxury now — because of their success in Guyana — of having some very good organic growth with the drill bit,"" said Bobby Tudor, founder and chief executive of Artemis Energy Partners.
""They are the exception rather than the rule, however, in that space.""
Some experts said the Pioneer deal demonstrated that investor pressure was forcing Exxon and the wider industry to give up on organic growth, which requires capital-intensive drilling operations and exploration. The tie-up and an expected fresh wave of M&A in the Permian would be likely to lead to less production over time, they said.
""In an industry that is growing gangbusters, you have diversification, you have more companies and increased competition. Whereas, in an industry that is plateauing, you see the opposite,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director of climate energy at Ceres, a coalition of investors and environmental groups.
""Exxon's deal with Pioneer is about bringing in production and focusing on efficiency in a way that is a lower risk than other uses of capital. They are definitely planning to be the last man standing [in oil and gas] but they may not be much bigger than they are today.""

| Jump to first hitExxonMobil Corp.'s acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. in a US$59.5-billion megadeal is being seen by some as a major vote of confidence in fossil fuels that also bodes well for the Canadian oilpatch.
The multinational oil giant announced the all-stock deal on Wednesday, its largest buyout since acquiring Mobil two decades ago and a move that will create a colossal hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operator in West Texas.
Observers have framed the deal as Exxon doubling down on fossil fuels at a time when the world is seeking to transition to lower-carbon energy sources in order to slow the pace of climate change.
Dan Tsubouchi, Calgary-based principal and chief market strategist at SAF Group, said Exxon is clearly confident that global demand for oil will remain strong in at least the immediate future.
""They're spending US$60 billion today,"" he said. ""They wouldn't do that if they didn't see at least a 10-to-15-year window for oil.""
That ""stronger for longer"" outlook is due to a variety of factors, Tsubouchi said, including that many of the technologies necessary for the energy transition - including hydrogen development, sustainable aviation fuel and more - have been slower to roll out than advocates might have hoped.
That combined with the war in Ukraine has led to global energy security concerns, spiking prices and oil and gas companies being flush with cash.
Exxon posted an unprecedented profit last year of US$55.7 billion, breezing past its previous record of US$45.22 billion in 2008 when oil prices hit record highs.
""Demand for oil is not going away as quickly as people assumed,"" Tsubouchi said, adding that after the Exxon-Pioneer merger, he wouldn't be surprised to see an uptick in merger and acquisition activity north of the border.
In particular, he said such deal-making may occur in the Montney region of northeast British Columbia and northwest Alberta, where horizontal fracking technology similar to what Exxon will be using in the Permian opens up opportunities for companies to increase production in a relatively cost-efficient manner.
Tsubouchi said oilsands bulls could also be looking to increase production in the coming years, though he said that will likely be accomplished through incremental add-ons to existing facilities, not through the whole-scale construction of a new oilsands mine.
""These companies aren't going to go into something like the megaprojects of the past,"" he said. ""But they will look at short-cycle projects where they can take advantage of a 10-15-year window, just like Exxon has.""
Canadian oil and gas executives have been vocal recently about what they see as an increasingly rosy outlook for fossil fuels.
Last week, Enbridge Inc. chief executive Greg Ebel spoke to the Toronto Region Board of Trade about why he thinks a Canadian liquefied natural gas industry could be part of the solution for the global energy crisis.
And Suncor Energy Inc. CEO Rich Kruger told ana lysts on a conference call earlier this year that while lower emissions energy is important, the way for Suncor to win in today's business environment is to focus on its core oilsands assets.
""Outwardly, the oil bulls are growing,"" said Duncan Kenyon of Investors for Paris Compliance, which takes financial positions in Canadian companies in an effort to hold them accountable to their net-zero emissions promises. ""It's obviously great times for them right now and there are short-term gains to be had.""
But Kenyon said the very fact that companies are favouring short-cycle, disciplined growth over big-spend, long-cycle projects shows there is still a lot of uncertainty in the industry about the pace and scale of the coming energy transition and how the oil industry will be affected.
""I think the industry and investors in this sector are really struggling to understand what's happening and how to prepare for these emerging risks,"" he said.
""And these are emerging risks that have the potential to flip-flop the energy system on its head, and fossil fuels end up on the bottom.""

ExxonMobil has agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in a $59.5bn deal that is set to unleash a wave of consolidation in the US shale oil industry.
The biggest western oil supermajor said yesterday it had sealed an all-stock deal that values Pioneer at $253 per share. The combination hands Exxon a dominant position in the Permian Basin, the vast field in western Texas and New Mexico that has helped turn the US into the world's largest oil and gas producer.
The purchase of Pioneer, which was founded by chief executive Scott Sheffield in 1997, is the group's biggest acquisition since it was formed through the merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999. It is also the first of any significant size under Darren Woods, who has led Exxon since 2017.
""The combined capabilities of our two companies will provide long-term value creation well in excess of what either company is capable of doing on a standalone basis,"" said Woods.
The bet on Pioneer also underlines Exxon's resolve to boost oil production despite forecasts that climate change will eventually force the world to switch to renewable energy. In contrast to Exxon, BP is targeting cuts in oil and gas production of 25 per cent by 2030.
Exxon is paying an 18 per cent premium for Pioneer based on the shale producer's closing share price on Thursday, when news of the pending transaction leaked. The enterprise value of the deal, including net debt, is about $64.5bn.
Houston-based Exxon has been on the hunt for acquisitions after amassing a substantial cash pile over the past year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices soaring, driving Exxon's profits to a record high.
Analysts expect the deal will herald consolidation across the still fragmented US shale industry, which has been subject to cycles of boom and bust over the past decade. After years of reckless spending, Wall Street has forced shale operators to stop pursuing costly drilling ventures from scratch, leaving acquisitions as the best means to secure a shrinking number of prime drilling sites.
Speaking before the deal was announced, Andrew Dittmar, analyst at consultancy Enverus, said the transaction represented a ""significant win"" for Exxon and a ""reasonable conclusion"" for Pioneer.
Pioneer is the pre-eminent operator in the Permian field and the deal brings 15 per cent of the basin's output under Exxon's control, according to RBC Capital Markets.
Following the acquisition, Exxon's output from the Permian field would more than double to 1.3mn barrels of oil equivalent per day. The transaction would transform its oil and gas business by lowering costs and increasing its capacity to rapidly boost production, Exxon said.
The Permian produces about 5.8mn barrels of oil a day, out of about 13mn b/ d in total US oil production.
Antitrust experts said the deal would probably draw scrutiny from US regulators but should win approval as the companies' combined holdings in the Permian only make up a fraction of global oil production.

Who will fund innovation in energy exploration and production? It is a fair question after ExxonMobil confirmed an all-share purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources. The deal will total $64.5bn in enterprise value, on an 18 per cent premium.
Known for its acreage in the oil-rich Permian Basin of Texas, Pioneer (and other independent wildcatters) perfected fracking to extract oil and gas. The cash flows never quite matched the hype. But fracking did make the US a leading producer and exporter of fossil fuels.
Antsy shareholders and elevated interest rates have left shale drillers such as Pioneer out of favour. Exxon says its integrated model of oil extraction and refining uniquely gives it the scale to squeeze out costs.
Pioneer and explorer peers have slashed capital spending, diverting cash flow to pay for dividends and buybacks. Still, Wall Street analysts estimate that of a $9bn of forecast cash flow from operations in 2024, half will go to capital expenditures. That same proportion at Exxon should be less than 40 per cent.
Even as Pioneer has committed 75 per cent of cash flow post capex to shareholders, its shares trade cheaply. The buyout price values Pioneer shares at 12 times forward earnings, relatively low historically. Exxon will pay with its own shares trading also at 12 times. Exxon bonds due in 2030 trade at a yield of just over 5 per cent. But given that the company is A rated, with only $40bn of existing debt, using equity rather than cash makes sense.
Exxon has calculated that giving up just over a tenth of its shares outstanding is worthwhile. It enables it to gather a chunk of Permian real estate, the associated cash flows, and what Exxon estimates as $2bn of annual synergies. The bulk will come from ""improved resource recovery"".
That boasts of its capabilities of removing resources from the ground cheaply rather than any exploration revolution. Investors should approve."

| Jump to first hitExxonMobil Corp. agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co. for US$59.5 billion, the supermajor's largest takeover in more than two decades, as it seeks to become the dominant producer of shale oil.
Exxon will pay US$253 per share in an all-stock deal, according to a statement on Wednesday. The agreement paves the way for Exxon's biggest acquisition since merging with Mobil Corp. in 1999 and is the world's largest corporate takeover announced this year.
The transaction amounts to an 18 per cent premium for Pioneer investors, based on the closing price on Oct. 5, when reports of the impending deal began to swirl. If finalized, the combination will make Exxon far and away the biggest player in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico and bring the company's daily production to nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day - 50 per cent more than the next biggest supermajor.
Exxon shares dropped 1.6 per cent at 6:58 a.m. in pre-market trading in New York. Pioneer climbed more than two per cent.
The agreement will allow Exxon to boost daily output in the Permian region to the equivalent of two million barrels in 2027, or more than half of the oil titan's current worldwide production. Exxon also pledged to reduce net-carbon dioxide emissions from Pioneer assets to zero by 2035, or 15 years sooner than originally planned, according to the release.
Exxon's inventory of yet-to-bedrilled sites in the world's biggest shale basin will expand, giving it access to a vast number of potential onshore wells that, unlike deepwater ones, can be brought online within months and make Exxon far more nimble at keeping pace with erratic global demand. The acquired assets will turn a profit even if crude prices dip as low as US$35 a barrel, Exxon said.
The combined company will control the equivalent of 16 billion barrels of crude reserves in the Permian region, according to the statement.
Exxon combining with Pioneer would also be the biggest push yet by an oil major into the Permian, consolidating a wide swath of the patch where production has been fragmented and largely the province of independent producers. When shale output in the basin began to boom around the middle of the last decade, big companies like Exxon were nowhere to be found.
Supermajors initially shunned the Permian because they were skeptical the wells there could produce sufficient crude over a long enough period of time to yield big profits. It became clear, however, that low-cost, easy-to-drill shale wells enabled companies to quickly ramp up production when needed. It marked a revolutionary departure from Big Oil's offshore mega projects that cost billions of dollars and require a decade of planning.
The Permian went on to become the Western Hemisphere's most-prolific oilfield, making the U.S. the top global producer.
The majors began to take serious notice around 2017, when Exxon bought drilling rights in the Permian from the Bass family of Fort Worth for US$6 billion. Chevron Corp., Shell PLC and BP all went on to become big players there, too. Nonetheless, the basin still has more than 1,000 producers, and the majors only make up about 15 per cent of overall production.
Exxon has been hunting for another significant acquisition in the Permian for years. The stars, however, never quite aligned. The company's finances took a hit during the pandemic as oil prices plunged and as it ramped up spending on large global projects, forcing Exxon to borrow billions of dollars to pay dividends.
The war in Ukraine changed the landscape. Exxon had already been pulling back on spending, cutting costs and reaping the benefits of pandemic-era investments. Then Russia's invasion sent oil prices surging. Exxon's profits jumped to a record US$59 billion in 2022. Its stock gained more than 80 per cent last year, providing the financial firepower for an era-defining deal with Pioneer.
The deal is apt to face tough antitrust scrutiny from the United States Federal Trade Commission. President Joe Biden has asked the commission to investigate high gasoline prices and last year singled out Exxon's record profits, accusing the company of making ""more money than God.""
Questions have swirled about a potential Exxon-Pioneer deal since April, when the smaller company's chief executive, Scott Sheffield, announced that he planned to retire at year's end. Sheffield has worked in the Permian since the 1970s and is credited as an architect of the shale boom that made the U.S. an oil powerhouse.
Sheffield's more than 20 collective years at the helm of Pioneer is one of the longest ongoing public CEO tenures in the U.S. oil industry. He cut his teeth in the Permian basin more than 40 years ago, continuing to work there through the dark decades when supermajors including Exxon abandoned the basin to search for crude overseas. By the time drilling and fracking innovations developed in natural gas fields were adapted to oil deposits around 2010, Pioneer was well-placed to become one of the fastest-growing producers.

Exxon Mobil is buying Pioneer Natural Resources in an all-stock deal valued at $59.5 billion, its largest buyout since acquiring Mobil two decades ago, creating a colossal fracking operator in West Texas. Including debt, Exxon is committing about $64.5 billion to the acquisition announced Wednesday, leaving no doubt of the Texas energy company's commitment to fossil fuels as energy prices surge. In the late 1990s, the merger between Exxon and Mobil was valued around $80 billion.
The deal with Pioneer Natural expands Exxon's presence in the Permian Basin that straddles the border between Texas and New Mexico. The region made up 18% of all U.S. natural gas production last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The latest Market Talks covering Energy and Utilities. Published exclusively on Dow Jones Newswires at 4:20 ET, 12:20 ET and 16:50 ET.
1347 ET – Exxon Mobil's acquisition of Pioneer was expected, but investors did not anticipate the upbeat pro-forma guidance on production. TD Cowen analysts Jason Gabelman and Brandon Bingham say in a research note that the company guided for 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day more than each entity's growth on its own. Exxon appears to expect a greater portion of its cost synergies coming from better resource recovery after the deal, meaning its production volumes will improve. The analysts expect some skepticism from investors around the guidance. ( ben.glickman@wsj.com ; @benglickman)
1221 ET – Oil stocks rise as crude prices increase, with some Middle East-focused operators gaining as initial worries about potential operational exposure to the Israel-Hamas conflict ease. Eastern Mediterranean-focused Energean advances 1.5% and Kurdistan-focused Genel Energy and Gulf Keystone Petroleum also rise. Energean's Karish-field gas production is continuing at the level reported at interims, Jefferies says. Among stocks exposed to production offshore Israel, UK-listed Energean is more affected than Israel-listed ones, the brokerage says. ""Interestingly, Tamar field-exposed companies are down the least,"" Jefferies analysts write. ""Tamar is the one field reported to have been shut-in so far and has production facilities closest to the Gaza Strip."" Brent crude rises 0.6% to $86.35 a barrel, boosting the likes of BP, Eni, Shell and TotalEnergies. ( philip.waller@wsj.com )
1046 ET – Natural gas prices are seeing increased volatility after a weekly EIA storage report that came in bullish compared to both forecasts and averages. The front-month contract briefly climbed toward a fresh 8-month high above $3.400/mmBtu immediately after the price-supportive report was released, but was recently down 0.3% at $3.365/mmBtu. The EIA says gas inventories rose last week by 84 billion cubic feet, which compares to a five-year-average rise of 93 bcf, and compares to forecasts in a WSJ survey for an 89-bcf injection. Total inventories now stand at 3.529 trillion cubic feet, and a storage surplus that was 5.3% above the five-year average a week ago narrows to just 4.8% above normal, the smallest percentile overhang since January. ( dan.molinski@wsj.com )
0819 ET – Natural gas prices are seeing some moderate weakness early in New York, down 1.8% at $3.318/mmBtu which would put them on track for a second straight day of declines. Prices rallied last week and early this week, ending Tuesday at $3.3820/mmBtu, the highest closing price since Jan. 23 and leaving prices 15% higher month-to-date. But while the rally appears now to have stalled out, a weekly EIA storage report due at 10:30 am ET may revive bullish sentiment. Analysts surveyed by WSJ are forecasting a below-average 89 billion cubic feet injection that, if confirmed, would narrow an inventory surplus to 5% above the five-year average, the smallest-percentile overhang since late January. ( dan.molinski@wsj.com )
0815 ET – US crude futures are regaining some traction after yesterday's nearly 3% drop, with the front-month WTI contract rising 1.5% to $84.72 a barrel after a monthly OPEC report reiterates forecasts for rising global oil demand both this year and next year. The overnight session saw WTI prices fall to as low as $82.78 after data late yesterday from trade group API showed a massive 12.9-million-barrel weekly increase in US crude-oil inventories. The official EIA report on US inventories is due today at 11 am ET, a day later than normal due to Monday's holiday. Brent crude also rebounds, up 1.6% at $87.21. ( dan.molinski@wsj.com )
0454 ET – The FTSE 100 rises 0.4% to 7652 points after a positive U.K. GDP report as well as rising energy stocks following an increase in oil and gas prices. The rise in oil and gas prices ""has lifted BP and Shell towards the top of the FTSE 100"", Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor says in a note. Oil firm BP and mining companies Endeavour Mining and Rio Tinto climb 2.3%, 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, as oil prices jump. Home construction company Taylor Wimpey is the biggest loser, down 4.1%, ""on ex-dividend day"", Scholar says. ( miriam.mukuru@wsj.com )
0241 ET – SK Innovation could deliver a 3Q earnings beat on a better oil-refining margin, Hanwha Investment & Securities analyst Yongsik Yun says in a research note. The South Korean energy company's oil inventory value could also be lifted by higher crude prices, Yun notes. The firm's refining margin likely improved to $9.5 per barrel in 3Q from a loss of $1.1 per barrel in 2Q, and its operating profit could reach KRW1.17 trillion in 3Q, 66% above the market consensus forecast, he reckons. Hanwha keeps its buy rating on the stock but cuts its target by 16% to KRW210,000, citing the company's unprofitable battery business. Share closed 2.8% higher at KRW146,800. ( kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com )
2130 ET – Dialog Group's profit margin may continue to improve in FY 2024, as its legacy loss-making contracts are expected to be finished by the year end, Maybank IB analysts Desmond Ch'ng and Jeremie Yap say in a note. Dialog's independent tank terminal storage rates are still stable and the utilization rate is about 90%, which could lead to a sustainable cash flows and profits, they say, adding that the weakening MYR/SGD may also benefit the company's profits. Maybank lowers its FY 2024-FY 2025 net profit forecast by 5%-9% to factor in some housekeeping. It cuts target price to MYR2.43 from MYR4.90 and maintains a buy rating. Shares are 1.4% lower at MYR2.12. ( yingxian.wong@wsj.com )
1806 ET – Boss Energy is now heading into the riskier commissioning stage of its Honeymoon uranium project, says Shaw & Partners, which downgrades the stock to sell from hold. Boss's shares have more than doubled since the start of January and that's an opportunity for investors to take some profits. ""We continue to like Boss for its operations being in Australia, its strategic uranium inventory (1.25 million lb currently valued at A$135 million), and its leverage to a uranium sector upcycle,"" analyst Andrew Hines says in a note. ""Nonetheless we see better value elsewhere in the sector."" ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)
1756 ET – With mining activity underway at Boss Energy's Honeymoon operation, the next big catalyst appears to be locking in buyers for some uranium production. Jefferies thinks Boss is close to finalizing offtake agreements, with contracts expected to be in place prior to first production. ""Uranium markets have clearly been moving in Boss's favor,"" analyst Chris Drew says in a note. ""We would expect price floors at close to US$60/lb for spot price linked offtake agreements."" Boss yesterday said Honeymoon remains on budget, with production due to start before the end of December. ( david.winning@wsj.com ; @dwinningWSJ)
1745 ET – The focus set on Exxon Mobil will be on its plans around improving resource recovery following the nearly $60B acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources, Goldman Sachs analysts say in a research note. Analysts see potential for another leg of improvement for shale oil capital efficiency where investors are concerned on both the quality and duration of the resource, analysts add. Exxon management expects synergies of about $1 billion beginning the second year post-closing and growing over the next five years to an average of about $2 billion per year over the next decade. Shares fall 0.3% to $106.15 in after-hours trading. ( sabela.ojea@wsj.com ; @sabelaojeaguix)
1327 ET – Natural gas has for years been the top source for electricity generation in the U.S., and its dominance is growing again this year, says the EIA in its monthly Short Term Energy Outlook. ""We forecast that electricity generation from natural gas will account for about 42% of U.S. generation in 2023, an increase from 39% in 2022,"" the EIA says. ""This increase is the result of relatively low prices for natural gas; the retirement of 10 gigawatts of coal-fired generating capacity this year; and 5 GW of new, highly efficient natural gas-turbine capacity entering service."" It says, however, that gas's piece of the pie could slip to 41% in 2024 as renewables become more widely used for making electricity. ( dan.molinski@wsj.com )
1237 ET – European stocks trade mixed as losses for oil and luxury-goods stocks offset gains in other sectors. BP drops 0.9%, TotalEnergies retreats 0.3% and Shell falls 0.6% as the price of Brent crude backtracks 1.5% to $86.34 a barrel. ""So far, the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East has remained contained,"" IG analyst Chris Beauchamp writes. ""As a result, oil prices have begun to fall again. However, even this weakness hasn't hit oil names too hard."" Luxury-goods stocks also drop after downbeat third-quarter results from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Still, banks gain and automotive, property and defense shares also make progress. The Stoxx Europe 600 and DAX advance 0.2%, though the FTSE 100 falls 0.1% and the CAC 40 retreats 0.4%. The Dow loses 0.2%. ( philip.waller@wsj.com )"

Exxon Mobil struck a nearly $60 billion agreement Wednesday to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades, tying the energy giant's future to fossil fuels.
The deal, at $253 a share, values Pioneer at an almost 7% premium to its closing market value of about $55.4 billion Tuesday. It cements Exxon's status as the dominant player in the U.S. fracking industry, now centered in West Texas, where Pioneer has more places to drill than almost all of its rivals.
Shares in Pioneer rose more than 1% on Wednesday. Exxon's stock dropped less than 4%.
The deal is Exxon's largest since its $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s and is the biggest corporate transaction so far this year. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Exxon and Pioneer were closing in on the tie-up.
The deal represents a premium of nearly 18% to Pioneer's share price on the day of the Journal article. The Journal had also reported in April that Exxon and Pioneer had held preliminary talks about a potential takeover.
Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. oil production, the demand for which it believes will linger for decades. In years past, Exxon scoured the globe for untapped reserves of oil before frackers unleashed vast amounts of domestic production. Following the deal, some 45% of Exxon's barrels will now come from the U.S., according to JPMorgan Chase.
The proposed tie-up could face close antitrust scrutiny from the Biden administration, which has been critical of big oil companies for not doing more to alleviate high gasoline prices. It has also challenged other big mergers, with mixed results.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the deal would increase U.S. energy security and benefit consumers by bringing Exxon's technical prowess and financial wherewithal to bear on shale resources. ""It's a win-win for the country,"" Woods said.
So far, consolidation in the U.S. oil patch has led to the deployment of fewer drilling rigs. While the U.S. will remain one of the world's largest fossil fuel producers for the foreseeable future, many in the industry have said drillers will no longer flood the market with oil when prices rise because of investor pressure to focus on returns instead of growth.
The megadeal would reshape the legacy of Woods. Under his watch, Exxon sputtered in 2020 to its first annual loss in decades as the pandemic ravaged the oil industry, and then it lost a proxy battle with a little-known activist investor the following year.
In 2022, as oil and gas prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Exxon rocketed to a record annual profit of $55.7 billion, becoming the fourth-most prosperous U.S. publicly traded company after Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, according to FactSet.
Woods has credited Exxon's countercyclical and sometimes unpopular investments in fossil-fuel projects, while others have pointed to higher oil prices and other factors outside the company's control.
Its cash windfall and the industry's recovery from the lows of the pandemic spurred Exxon executives to begin looking for transformative deals, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where Pioneer drills.
There are risks attached to the deal, including the potential for crude demand to sputter sooner than Exxon anticipated. The International Energy Agency recently predicted that demand for fossil fuels would peak this decade. Exxon believes that oil consumption will remain robust for decades, with growing demand driven by commercial transportation and feedstocks for the chemical industry.
The deal enhances Exxon's exposure to crude prices, and any decline would erode returns from the acquisition, said David Deckelbaum, an analyst at investment bank TD Cowen. Still, he noted that Pioneer's barrels are among the cheapest to produce in the world.
Exxon has made risky acquisitions before -- notably a $31 billion deal to acquire shale gas producer XTO in 2009 that backfired when natural-gas prices cratered.
The companies said that the combined entity would have an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Permian, and would allow Exxon's Permian production to double to more than 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
They said they expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2024.
The deal is by far the biggest takeover in a year of muted merger-and-acquisition activity. Global M&A volume stands at about $2 trillion, down 30% from the same period last year, according to Dealogic, as higher interest rates, economic uncertainty and a tough antitrust environment deter would-be deal makers.
Exxon's all-stock transaction leans heavily on its higher share price relative to its peers over the past year. Several institutional investment firms have snapped up more of Exxon's shares following a surge in oil and gas prices.
In April, Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield said he would retire at the end of the year. Sheffield is set to receive a roughly $29 million payout following the acquisition and is separately entitled to a nearly $13 million payout as part of his retirement package.

Is Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods seeking protection from President Biden? On Wednesday the oil and gas giant struck a $59.5 billion deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. The way to read the deal is as a bet on U.S. shale fracking and hedge against the left's anti-fossil fuels policies.
The acquisition is a response to higher interest rates that are raising the cost of capital for smaller producers, as well as to a hostile regulatory environment making it more difficult to explore and develop new resources. It would make Exxon the biggest player in the rich Permian shale basin that spans Texas and New Mexico.
Wildcatters pioneered hydraulic shale fracturing, aka fracking, and horizontal drilling some two decades ago. Many failed or sold out to larger producers when oil prices plunged in the middle of the last decade and again during the pandemic. Now rising interest rates are making it more expensive to drill, which is encouraging more consolidation.
Pioneer holds prized assets in the Permian, which Exxon says complement its own. By combining they will be able to drill longer, more productive horizontal wells while reducing the need to acquire new leases and permits. Exxon says the deal will let it drill laterals up to four miles long, resulting in fewer wells and a smaller environmental impact.
The merger would more than double Exxon's current Permian production and nearly quadruple it by 2027 to two million barrels of oil equivalent a day, which is more than half of its current worldwide production. Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. shale despite its forays into biofuels and carbon capture that are heavily subsidized by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
The Permian is among the lowest cost drilling regions in the world and can turn a profit even with oil at $35 a barrel. Unlike conventional resources that take decades to develop and pay off, shale yields a quick return on investment. The Pioneer tie-up makes Exxon less vulnerable to government policies aimed at reducing long-term supply and demand.
In response to criticism of its climate policies, the Biden Administration has been pointing out that U.S. oil production is set to surpass pre-pandemic levels this year. But Canada achieved this milestone last year, and U.S. output has been increasing mainly because producers are running down their inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells.
Since January 2020, the number of such wells has dropped to 830 from 3,330 in the Permian. The Administration continues to slow-walk new drilling permits and leases, which increases the incentive for producers to grow by acquisition. How ironic that Mr. Biden's climate policies create an incentive for big players to get bigger.
The Interior Department last month released its statutorily mandated five-year offshore leasing plan, more than a year late. It included a mere three auctions through 2029 -- the least necessary to comply with the IRA. Since 1992 no five-year plan has offered fewer than 11 lease sales. Any wonder that Exxon has been investing heavily off Guyana?
As Mr. Woods has noted, the world will need fossil fuels for many decades. It's better for U.S. workers and the economy if production happens at home rather than overseas."

Several large corporate acquisitions are set to close, so the takeover arbitrage community has been hoping for a big new transaction that would offer a way to put money to work. It got an enormous one Wednesday with Exxon Mobil's agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. 
But the oil merger doesn't look lucrative for many arbitragers seeking to gain from the gap between what Exxon (ticker: XOM) is offering for Pioneer (PXD) and where the shale-oil company's stock is trading.
Exxon is buying Pioneer in an all-stock deal valued at $59.5 billion, or $253 a share, based on Exxon's closing price on Oct. 5. The oil company is offering 2.3234 of its shares for each Pioneer share. Exxon shares finished Wednesday down 3.6% to $106.49., while Pioneer stock was up 1.4% to $240.82.
That means the value of the Exxon offer is about $247 a share, a roughly 2.5% premium to Pioneer's stock price. That 2.5%, known as the arbitrage spread, looks small.
Exxon has said it expects to close the transaction in the first half of 2024. Assuming the deal closes around March 31, investors would earn a roughly 5% annualized return, Barron's estimates.
That is less than the 5.5% rate on the six-month Treasury bill, and there is a risk that the deal doesn't occur. Many arbitrage spreads this year have offered double-digit annual returns.
Professional arbitrage investors, however, calculate a higher annualized return of around 10% because of dividends on Pioneer stock and other payments. Figuring out that return is complicated because Pioneer pays a variable dividend tied to profits. Someone putting on the arbitrage would buy Pioneer and sell short Exxon. The arbitrager would have to pay the dividends on the Exxon short position.
Another issue is that institutions can get so-called rebates of about 5% on their short positions in Exxon. That would add to the returns available to professional arbitragers. Two arbitragers tell Barron's that taking into accounts dividends and the short rebate, a professional arbitrager could earn a roughly 10% annualized return.
That return, however, likely would be unavailable to retail investors, reducing the appeal of the Pioneer arbitrage to the general public.
The best-case return on the Exxon/Pioneer deal, for either professional or retail investors, is below those that arbs have earned on Microsoft's (MSFT) deal for Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and Broadcom's (AVGO) deal for VMware (VMW), both of which are due to close this month. Arbs try to get a return of at least a few percentage points above risk-free Treasury bills to compensate for the risk.
Whether the deal happens at all isn't certain. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told CNBC on Wednesday morning that he doesn't anticipate any regulatory objections, but it is possible that President Joe Biden's activist antitrust team, notably Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, could look to challenge the transaction.
The longer the deal takes to close, the lower the returns for arbitragers. If the deal doesn't happen, Pioneer stock could drop 10% or more. It doesn't look like another bidder will emerge to prop up the price.
Before Biden, one arbitrager told Barron's, the deal likely wouldn't have generated much scrutiny given the fragmentation of the U.S. energy business. But there is no great love for Exxon and Big Oil in the administration: Biden said last year that Exxon ""made more money than God.""
All that could leave the takeover arbitrage community still looking for deals to put to work funds that have been tied up in trades linked to other transactions. Amgen recently closed on its $28 billion deal for Horizon Therapeutics and the Microsoft and Broadcom transactions are due to close this month.
Microsoft is paying about $75 billion for Activision Blizzard while Broadcom is paying a similar amount for VMware.
It isn't clear whether the selloff in Exxon shares is related to arbs buying Pioneer and selling short Exxon to lock in a spread. There also could be displeasure among investors that Exxon is doing a big all-stock deal and potentially overpaying. Exxon will issue about 540 million shares, or about 14% of its currently outstanding shares, Barron's estimates.
It doesn't seem likely that investors are disappointed by the price. The deal values Pioneer at little more than 11 times its projected 2023 earnings.
But it is notable that Exxon is using all stock in the deal, choosing not to take on debt in order to pay with cash. The company had only about $12 billion of net debt at the end of the second quarter, so it could easily have borrowed the entire price. That likely would have made the transaction more accretive to earnings, even accounting for how higher Treasury yields would have boosted Exxon's borrowing costs.

Exxon Mobil confirmed a deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources on Wednesday, cementing itself as the dominant oil producer in the Permian Basin region of the U.S. The early assessment from several analysts is that Exxon is paying a reasonable price, buying a well-regarded producer at a modest valuation.
After including Pioneer's debt, Exxon (ticker: XOM) will pay $64.5 billion in the all-stock transaction. It is Exxon's biggest acquisition since its merger with Mobil in 1999.
The takeout price values Pioneer at 5.9 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization — a discount to Exxon's own valuation of six times Ebitda, according to Tudor Pickering Holt analyst Jeffrey Lambujon.
The deal values Pioneer shares at an 18% premium to where they were trading before The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the deal was close to being finalized. Exxon shares were down 3.5% in early trading. Pioneer (PXD) rose 1%.
""The deal was highly anticipated and we expect the 18% premium to be viewed fairly and do not anticipate rival bids,"" wrote TD Cowen analyst David Deckenbaum.
""Pioneer is a clear leader in the Permian with a unique asset base and people with deep industry knowledge,"" said Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods. ""The combined capabilities of our two companies will provide long-term value creation well in excess of what either company is capable of doing on a stand-alone basis.""
Acquiring Pioneer will jumpstart Exxon's U.S. production growth, more than doubling its output in the Permian to about 1.3 million barrels a day. Exxon's U.S. production has declined recently.
""U.S. production volumes have actually been negative for the past four quarters–a stretch not seen since 2018,"" noted Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at Third Bridge.
The combined company will be able to produce 2 million barrels per day in the Permian by 2027, Exxon said. Globally, Exxon is targeting 5 million barrels of daily production by 2027. That would represent about 5% of the total global oil supply. Pioneer's acreage in the Midland Basin, the eastern part of the Permian, has some of the U.S.'s largest untapped fields.
The deal reaffirms Exxon's commitment to production of oil and gas and gives it room to grow domestically, avoiding geopolitical tension. But doubling down on oil comes with risks too, depending on the speed of the energy transition. Pioneer had been investing in technology to reduce emissions, but not as aggressively as some competitors.
Exxon says it expects to accelerate Pioneer's emission-reduction strategies.
The deal comes after crude prices started to pick up again. Crude has mostly fallen this year after a strong climb in 2022 that led to record profits at Exxon and other Big Oil firms. The attack on Israel this week pushed prices higher on concerns that the conflict could disrupt global supply, illustrating the benefits of having more exploration acreage at home.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have announced reductions in output to keep prices from falling back too much now.
The Exxon deal is the biggest so far this year. It eclipses Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) purchase of Anadarko for $38 billion in 2019.
It remains to be seen if this leads to more consolidation in the industry. Other shale drillers rose. Diamondback Energy (FANG) was up 0.8%, while Permian Resources (PR) was 0.1% higher, slipping back from a larger gain seen in premarket trading.

Exxon Mobil struck a nearly $60 billion agreement Wednesday to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades, tying the energy giant's future to fossil fuels.
The deal, at $253 a share, values Pioneer at an almost 7% premium to its closing market value of about $55.4 billion Tuesday. It cements Exxon's status as the dominant player in the U.S. fracking industry, now centered in West Texas, where Pioneer has more places to drill than almost all of its rivals.
Shares in Pioneer rose more than 1% Wednesday. Exxon's stock dropped less than 4%.
The deal is Exxon's largest since its $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s and is the biggest corporate transaction so far this year. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Exxon and Pioneer were closing in on the tie-up .
The deal represents a premium of nearly 18% to Pioneer's share price on the day of the Journal article. The Journal had also reported in April that Exxon and Pioneer had held preliminary talks about a potential takeover.
Exxon is making a huge bet on U.S. oil production , the demand for which it believes will linger for decades. In years past, Exxon scoured the globe for untapped reserves of oil before frackers unleashed vast amounts of domestic production. Following the deal, some 45% of Exxon's barrels will now come from the U.S., according to JPMorgan Chase.
The proposed tie-up could face close antitrust scrutiny from the Biden administration, which has been critical of big oil companies for not doing more to alleviate high gasoline prices. It has also challenged other big mergers, with mixed results.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said the deal would increase U.S. energy security and benefit consumers by bringing Exxon's technical prowess and financial wherewithal to bear on shale resources.
""It's a win-win for the country,"" Woods said in an interview.
So far, consolidation in the U.S. oil patch has led to the deployment of fewer drilling rigs . While the U.S. will remain one of the world's largest fossil fuel producers for the foreseeable future, many in the industry say drillers will no longer flood the market with oil when prices rise because of investor pressure to focus on returns instead of growth.
The megadeal would reshape the legacy of Woods. Under his watch, Exxon sputtered in 2020 to its first annual loss in decades as the pandemic ravaged the oil industry, and then it lost a proxy battle with a little-known activist investor the following year.
In 2022, as oil and gas prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Exxon rocketed to a record annual profit of $55.7 billion, becoming the fourth-most prosperous American publicly traded company after Apple, Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet, according to FactSet.
Woods has credited his company's countercyclical and sometimes unpopular investments in fossil-fuel projects, while others have pointed to higher oil prices and other factors outside the company's control.
Its cash windfall and the industry's recovery from the lows of the pandemic spurred Exxon executives to begin looking for transformative deals, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where Pioneer drills.
There are risks attached to the deal, including the potential for crude demand to stutter sooner than Exxon anticipated. The International Energy Agency recently predicted that demand for fossil fuels would peak this decade. Exxon believes that oil consumption will remain robust for decades, with growing demand driven by commercial transportation and feedstocks for the chemical industry.
The deal enhances Exxon's exposure to crude prices, and any decline would erode returns from the acquisition, said David Deckelbaum, an analyst at investment bank TD Cowen. Still, he noted that Pioneer's barrels are among the cheapest to produce in the world.
Exxon has made risky acquisitions before—notably a $31 billion deal to acquire shale gas producer XTO in 2009 that backfired when natural-gas prices cratered.
The companies said that the combined entity would have an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent in the Permian, and would allow Exxon's Permian production to double to more than 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.
They said they expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2024.
The deal is by far the biggest takeover in a year of muted merger-and-acquisition activity. Global M&A volume stands at about $2 trillion, down 30% from the same period last year, according to Dealogic, as higher interest rates, economic uncertainty and a tough antitrust environment deter would-be deal makers.
Exxon's all-stock transaction leans heavily on its higher share price relative to its peers over the past year. Several institutional investment firms have snapped up more of Exxon's shares following a surge in oil and gas prices.
Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield built the Dallas company from a medium-size oil producer into one of the biggest U.S. shale companies. One of the industry's most prominent executives, he said in April that he would retire at the end of the year.
In an interview, Sheffield said Woods approached him two weeks ago to negotiate a deal. He said that an 18% premium was a strong offer, and that Woods demonstrated fairness in negotiating what would happen to Pioneer's offices and employees. Sheffield said he would become a director on Exxon's board following the acquisition.
The deal could be worth tens of millions of dollars to Sheffield, according to a Journal review of company filings. The CEO is set to receive a roughly $29 million payout following the acquisition, and is separately entitled to a nearly $13 million payout as part of his retirement package. He also owns more than $140 million worth of Pioneer stock, according to Capital IQ.
The deal puts pressure on Exxon rival Chevron and could usher in an era of megamergers as large public companies flush with cash and backed by new capital from institutional investors nab smaller competitors.
Exxon's purchase indicates that the Texas-based company, like its competitors, is looking to augment its inventory of premium wells in the Permian, said Neal Dingmann, an analyst at investment bank Truist Securities.
""Pioneer continues to have among the best inventory positions out there,"" he said.
The Pioneer deal marks Exxon's second sizable transaction in less than three months. In July, it paid almost $5 billion to buy Denbury, a pipeline operator that moves carbon dioxide.
While some investors have pushed Exxon and other oil giants to pour money into renewable energy, Woods has argued the company should stick with technologies that hew closely to its core oil business, such as carbon capture and storage and hydrogen, and avoid straying into sectors where it doesn't have expertise.
Exxon has pledged to significantly cut carbon emissions from its business, though not those from products used by consumers, while continuing to primarily invest in oil and gas production. Environmentalists, lawmakers and others have said that strategy undermines climate-change targets by perpetuating oil consumption.
Exxon has said it would pump $17 billion through 2027 into low-carbon investments such as carbon capture, while spending up to $25 billion each year in the same period largely on its fossil-fuel business. Woods said acquiring Pioneer would allow Exxon to reduce emissions from the fracker's operations, saying the deal would ""grow shareholder value and improve the environment.""

ExxonMobil's pursuit of Pioneer Natural Resources heralds an era of potential megadeals in the US shale oil industry, analysts say, in which the long-fragmented sector is controlled by a handful of larger operators.
The top western oil supermajor was in talks with Pioneer over a potential acquisition, people familiar with the matter said last week. A takeover of Pioneer, which has an enterprise value of $56bn, would be Exxon's biggest since its landmark merger with Mobil in 1999.
A combined company would also be the undisputed leader in the Permian Basin, the vast field in western Texas and New Mexico that has powered America's rise to become the world's largest oil and gas producer.
Analysts say a transaction could turbocharge merger and acquisition activity in the US shale patch as other companies seek to match Exxon's unrivalled scale.
""This is a new era in the shale industry,"" said Matthew Bernstein, senior shale analyst at Rystad Energy, a consultancy. ""It's hard to overstate the importance that this deal will have in terms of the Permian becoming consolidated.""
A flurry of big M&A deals in the late 1990s and early 2000s condensed control of US oil and gas production into the hands of fewer players as BP absorbed Amoco and Arco, Chevron swallowed Texaco and Exxon combined with Mobil.
Their dominance faded as wildcatting entrepreneurs, deploying horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology, bought up drilling rights from Texas to North Dakota and unleashed the shale revolution in the past decade and a half. Pioneer, led by chief executive Scott Sheffield, was among the challengers to the likes of Exxon.
Now, as drilling inventory dwindles, a new wave of mergers is under way in the shale patch. Companies prefer acquiring new acreage through M&A rather than undertaking expensive drilling.
But a deal between Exxon and Pioneer could spark a frenzy of activity as bigger companies become acquisition targets.
""Consolidation is going to happen, regardless of the outcome of Pioneer and Exxon — but a transaction of this size certainly puts large companies into play,"" said Kevin MacCurdy, director of research at Pickering Energy Partners, a Houston-based financial advisory firm.
Other big players would be likely to be encouraged to pursue acquisitions more aggressively. Smaller groups could also seek to merge in pursuit of scale.
""A deal would increase the pressure on Chevron, which is competing with Exxon for US and global investors' money,"" said Ryan Todd, analyst at Piper Sandler. ""It would increase the relative concerns in investors' minds on the portfolio depth between the two companies.""
Darren Woods, Exxon chief executive, has told investors that his goal is to ensure that the company holds best-inclass positions in all sectors in which it operates.
Woods and other Exxon executives told analysts during a visit to Goldman Sachs' headquarters last month that the oil major preferred to buy assets in the Permian with ""a large, contiguous acreage that was deeper in inventory"", according to a note published by the investment bank on Friday.
Exxon's desire to expand its oil assets reflects its belief that fossil fuels will remain part of the global economy for years to come, despite warnings that demand must fall to protect the Earth's climate.
It said it could use its proprietary techniques and technology to improve its oil and gas recovery rate in the Permian. Exxon earned record profits in 2022 and had about $30bn in cash on its balance sheet as of June, while its market capitalisation was $427bn on Friday.
Analysts said Permian-focused companies such as Diamondback Energy, Permian Resources and Matador Resources Company were now likely to be on the radar of larger operators hunting for deals. The shares of each of these companies jumped by about 4 per cent on Friday.
Exxon, Pioneer and Chevron all said they did not comment on market rumours or speculation. The talks between Exxon and Pioneer could still fall apart.
Much of Pioneer's acreage in the Permian is situated next to Exxon's and a merger could allow for significant cost savings, according to analysts. Pioneer is the largest producer in the basin, with 9 per cent of gross production there, while Exxon is the fifth-largest at 6 per cent, according to RBC Capital markets. The Permian produces about 5.8mn barrels of oil a day, out of about 13mn b/d in total US oil production.
Jeffrey Oliver, an antitrust expert at
Baker Botts, a law firm, said an Exxon- Pioneer deal would almost certainly prompt a telephone call and some questions from the Federal Trade Commission, the US competition regulator.
""Antitrust has almost become a religion, so there will be questions about whether a deal this size is destined to get really close scrutiny,"" he said, although he predicted that a deal would eventually gain regulatory approval.
News of the takeover talks between Exxon and Pioneer sent a frisson of excitement through the shale industry, although many executives declined to comment publicly on the speculation.
One shale executive said that if a deal went ahead, and had a good reception from investors, it would probably spark a ""feeding frenzy"" with larger operators snapping up smaller rivals. ""Everyone has been a little worried about what would shareholders do and how would they respond to a big deal like this. Well, they're about to see,"" he said.

The U.S. oil industry could be on the cusp of consolidation that would deliver a band of unruly shale frackers into the hands of a few old-guard producers.
Exxon Mobil is trying to seal a deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in a blockbuster takeover that could be valued around $60 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. It isn't the only company looking for a deal.
Rivals Chevron and ConocoPhillips are scouring the shale patch for targets, while smaller drillers have started to make clear they are available for the right price, people familiar with the matter said.
The most-desirable drilling bounties are in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where investors and energy executives say a deal-making scramble is in the works.
A wave of deals could reshape the U.S. oil-and-gas industry, from an era defined by relatively small drillers chasing growth to one dominated by the largest Western oil companies. The emerging order could resemble what came out of the industry's megamergers that began in the late 1990s and included linkups between Exxon and Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, and BP and Amoco, among others.
Oil producers have escaped rigorous antitrust scrutiny historically, as regulators often take the view that their products compete in a global market. Current and former oil executives said they felt regulators wouldn't likely block a new round of deals.
Investors signaled their expectation that more deals could be in the offing by piling into frackers' stocks on Friday. All told, they added about $16 billion in market capitalization to the 10 largest independent drillers following the news.
Exxon, Chevron and their peers are sitting on historically large war chests, filled by a prolonged period of high commodity prices because of postpandemic economic growth and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But the companies have been hamstrung in deploying the cash by investors who have insisted producers keep spending disciplined and give them huge payouts instead of chasing growth unprofitably, as the companies did over the previous decade. Some investors have pushed oil companies to invest in greener energy sources and reduce emissions, which many drillers have done, to varying degrees.
Drillers accommodated investors for the past two years, but appear ready to test the waters on putting their cash to use, with Exxon CEO Darren Woods leading the way.
The deliberations between Exxon and Pioneer were fluid Friday, with people close to the matter cautioning there still might be no deal. Some shareholders have expressed reservations about the potential tie-up. But in a sign some are betting on a deal, Pioneer stock shot up more than 10% on Friday. Exxon shares edged down less than 2%.
If consummated, the deal would immediately put pressure on Exxon's rivals, Chevron chief among them. Exxon is by far the largest Western oil company, with a market capitalization of about $430 billion. Adding Pioneer would strengthen its market share and pricing power with suppliers and service companies while positioning it to boost oil production for years to come.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has been looking for a big deal of his own. After gobbling up a pair of smaller drillers over the past three years, Wirth has begun thinking about leaving the company with as much running room as possible before he retires, people familiar with the matter said.
As recently as the beginning of the year, Chevron was interested in Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest producers in the Permian, people familiar with the matter said. Acquiring Occidental, which has a market capitalization of about $55 billion, would rival Exxon's deal for Pioneer, but Chevron's interest has fizzled in recent months.
Chevron has moved on to other, smaller targets, people familiar with the matter said. There are several options in the Permian, including CrownRock, one of the region's largest private producers, which has hired bankers to advise it on a potential deal and is seeking a sale price of around $10 billion to $15 billion.
Small producers spearheaded the shale boom, deploying new production techniques to unlock troves of oil in regions shunned by others -- and turning the U.S. into the world's largest oil producer. Large public companies followed, turning attention away from far-flung locales and back to places such as the Permian Basin.
Myriad wildcatters grew shale by taking on billions of dollars of debt and, with investors' blessing, deploying thousands of oil rigs. But many of these producers drilled themselves out of cash on wells that proved less profitable than promised and filed for bankruptcy when oil prices crashed between 2014 and 2015. The period reached its nadir during the pandemic when oil prices collapsed again.
Now, the large cohort of middling shale companies that ran up huge debt piles to grow as fast as possible are too small to attract capital from Wall Street and are running out of their best drilling sweet spots, making them cheaper acquisition targets.
""There are too many companies,"" said Mark Viviano, a managing partner at investment firm Kimmeridge Energy Management. ""Consolidation is the last piece of the puzzle in rationalizing the shale industry.""
Market conditions are ripe for deals as oilprices have recovered from a trough this year and are high enough that sellers think they can get a good deal, but not so high as to deter potential buyers, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners.
Historically, big deals in the oil patch have come in waves. BP's $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco in 1998 set off the deal bonanza that created the world's supermajors. After the onset of the pandemic in 2020, ConocoPhillips scooped up Concho Resources and Shell's Permian assets for almost $20 billion combined; Pioneer bought Parsley Energy and DoublePoint Energy for a combined $11 billion; Chevron snapped up Noble Energy for about $5 billion.
Pickering said a deal between Exxon and Pioneer would create new momentum for transactions in the Permian as it would demonstrate that even one of the largest U.S. producers has to build up its inventory, and that remaining resources in the most prolific basin in the nation are becoming scarce.
Lately in the oil patch, bigger companies have attracted an outsize portion of investors' capital. Last year, some of the largest institutional investors, including Capital Group, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, increased their U.S. energy holdings to a combined $170 billion, up 27% from 2017.
But most of that investing benefited the five largest U.S. oil companies -- Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources, as well as oil-field services giant Schlumberger -- which together accounted for about $88 billion of the investment firms' holdings last year, up from $49 billion in 2017, according to an analysis by Kimmeridge.
A Pioneer tie-up would make Exxon by far the largest oil-and-gas producer in the contiguous U.S., almost 50% bigger than Chevron, which is currently the largest producer in the region, according to energy-research firm Wood Mackenzie.

ExxonMobil is in talks to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in what would be the oil supermajor's biggest acquisition in more than two decades, according to people familiar with the matter. Pioneer is the largest oil producer in Texas and had a market capitalisation of $50bn at the close of trading on Thursday. Exxon, the largest US oil company, has been scouring for deals to expand production and is flush with cash after higher energy prices delivered bumper profits.
An acquisition would be Exxon's biggest since it was formed in a tie-up between Exxon and Mobil in 1999. It would be the largest in the US oil industry for at least four years, when Occidental Petroleum bought rival Anadarko Petroleum for $55bn in 2019 after outbidding Chevron in a corporate battle.
Purchasing Pioneer would transform Exxon's footprint in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico — the most prolific US oilfield — and bolster its position as the leading western oil company.
Exxon and Pioneer declined to comment on the talks which could still fail.
Shares of Exxon had fallen 1.6 per cent by midday in New York yesterday, while Pioneer jumped 9.1 per cent. Both companies raked in record profits last year after Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove up oil and natural gas prices.
For Pioneer, a takeover would mark the end of an era for a company that has ridden the ups and downs of a shale energy boom that transformed the US into the world's biggest oil and gas producer. A deal would be the latest in a wave of merger and acquisition activity sweeping through America's shale patch as companies look to consolidate.
After years of profligate spending, Wall Street has insisted that companies ditch costly drilling ventures and instead return cash to shareholders. That has left acquisitions as the only means to significantly expand and companies have raced to acquire a dwindling number of prime drilling sites.
Exxon paid $5bn for Denbury Resources in July, acquiring assets including its extensive network of carbon dioxide pipelines.
Buying Pioneer would easily outstrip the supermajor's purchase of XTO Energy for $41bn in 2009 — a bet on natural gas that it later conceded had been ill timed.

Energy groups are making barrels of cash. They have limited options to deploy it. So how best to spend it?
Snapping up a rival, even at the top of the commodity cycle, must be a tempting solution. That is one way to read reports that Exxon is in talks to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a USlisted shale giant worth $55.6bn including debt. The terms of the potential deal are unclear, as is whether any offer would be in cash or stock.
Yet there are good reasons for Exxon to explore this prospect. For one thing, it has the money to do so. Buoyant oil prices last year mean it is gushing cash — $77bn of it in 2022. Investing in new fossil resources is unpopular in a carbon-constrained world. Exxon's capital expenditure hovers at about $20bn, down from more than $30bn a decade ago.
Diverting a sizeable amount of money into renewable energy, while worthy, means contending with lower returns. That leaves Exxon returning oodles of cash to shareholders. With net debt at $12bn, this old tiger has a lot of gas in its tank.
Cash is not Exxon's only acquisition currency, either. At 12 times next year's earnings, on S&P Global estimates, its stock trades at a nice premium of 33 per cent to Pioneer's.
Most importantly, swallowing Pioneer would bolster Exxon's position in the prolific Permian Basin, a shale patch beneath Texas and New Mexico.
Contiguous acreage would allow the companies to take an axe to costs. By way of reference, Citigroup reckons that ConocoPhillips cut about a quarter of Concho's capex and overheads when it bought its smaller rival in 2020.
Applying that to Pioneer would yield $1.25bn which, taxed and capitalised, should cover the rumoured 20 per cent premium, worth about $10bn.
A deal has not yet been agreed. However, news of Exxon's interest is a useful reminder that, amid high oil prices, the sector's animal spirits are due a revival."

A new blockbuster deal could be coming to the oil industry. Exxon Mobil is closing in on a takeover of shale driller Pioneer Natural Resources that could be worth roughly $60 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. An acquisition of Pioneer would likely be Exxon's largest deal since its $75 billion megamerger with Mobil in 1999. The news was a bright spot for energy investors as falling oil prices weighed on the sector earlier in the week. Pioneer was the best performer in the S&P 500 Friday. Pioneer shares jumped 10%, while Exxon shares decreased 1.7%.

Egg prices are starting to crack. Cal-Maine's quarterly sales dropped 30% from a year earlier, and the company said its average selling price for a dozen eggs fell to $1.59 from $2.28 a year ago. The industry is recovering from 2022's avian-flu outbreak -- the deadliest in U.S. history -- that helped push prices above $4 a dozen in January. Eggs have been a dramatic example of U.S. food inflation. Prices soared more than 30% last year, outpacing all other grocery items, according to market research firm Circana Group.

The U.S. oil industry could be on the cusp of consolidation that would deliver a band of unruly shale frackers into the hands of a few old-guard producers.
Exxon Mobil is trying to seal a deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in a blockbuster takeover that could be worth roughly $60 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. It isn't the only company looking for a deal.
Rivals Chevron and ConocoPhillips are also scouring the shale patch for targets, while smaller drillers have started to make it clear they are available for the right price, according to people familiar with the matter.
The most desirable drilling bounties are in the oil-soaked Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where investors and energy executives say a deal-making scramble is in the works.
A wave of deals could reshape the U.S. oil-and-gas industry, ushering it from an era defined by relatively small drillers chasing growth to one dominated by the largest Western oil companies. The emerging order could resemble what came out of the industry's megamergers that began in the late 1990s and included linkups between Exxon and Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, and BP and Amoco, among others.
Oil producers have escaped rigorous antitrust scrutiny historically, as regulators often take the view that their products compete in a global market. Current and former oil executives said they felt regulators wouldn't likely block a new round of deals.
Investors signaled their expectation that more deals could be in the offing by piling into the stocks of frackers on Friday. All told, they added about $16 billion in market capitalization to the 10 largest independent drillers following the news.
Exxon, Chevron and their peers are sitting on historically large war chests , filled by a prolonged period of high commodity prices because of postpandemic economic growth and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
But the companies have been hamstrung in deploying the cash by investors who have insisted producers keep spending disciplined and give them huge payouts instead of chasing growth unprofitably, as the companies did over the previous decade. Some investors have pushed oil companies to invest in greener energy sources and reduce emissions, which many drillers have done, to varying degrees.
Drillers have accommodated investors for the past two years, but appear ready to test the waters on putting their cash to use, with Exxon CEO Darren Woods leading the way.
The deliberations between Exxon and Pioneer were fluid Friday, with people close to the matter cautioning there still might be no deal. One issue: Some shareholders have expressed reservations about the potential tie-up. But in a sign some are betting on a deal, Pioneer stock shot up more than 10% Friday. Exxon shares edged down less than 2%.
If consummated, the deal would immediately put pressure on Exxon's rivals, Chevron chief among them. Exxon is by far the largest Western oil company, with a market capitalization of about $430 billion, and adding Pioneer would strengthen its market share and pricing power with suppliers and service companies while positioning it to boost oil production for years to come.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has been looking for a big deal of his own. After gobbling up a pair of smaller drillers over the past three years, Wirth has begun thinking about leaving the company with as much running room as possible before he retires, said people familiar with the matter.
As recently as the beginning of the year, Chevron was interested in Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest producers in the Permian, according to people familiar with the matter. Acquiring Occidental, which has a market capitalization of about $55 billion, would rival Exxon's deal for Pioneer, but Chevron's interest has fizzled in recent months.
Chevron has since moved on to other, smaller targets, people familiar with the matter said. There are several options in the Permian, including CrownRock, one of the region's largest private producers, which has hired bankers to advise it on a potential deal and is seeking a sale price of around $10 billion to $15 billion.
Small producers spearheaded the shale boom, deploying new production techniques to unlock troves of oil in regions shunned by others—and turning the U.S. into the world's largest oil producer. Large public companies followed, turning their attention away from far-flung locales and back to places such as the Permian Basin, a dormant region until the advent of fracking.
Myriad rowdy wildcatters grew shale by taking on billions of dollars of debt and, with investors' blessing, deploying thousands of oil rigs. But many of these producers drilled themselves out of cash on wells that proved less profitable than promised and filed for bankruptcy when oil prices crashed between 2014 and 2015. The period reached its nadir during the pandemic when oil prices collapsed again.
Now, the large cohort of middling shale companies that ran up huge debt piles to grow as fast as possible are too small to attract capital from Wall Street and are running out of their best drilling sweet spots , making them cheaper acquisition targets.
""There are too many companies,"" said Mark Viviano, a managing partner at investment firm Kimmeridge Energy Management. ""Consolidation is the last piece of the puzzle in rationalizing the shale industry.""
Market conditions are ripe for deals as oil prices have recovered from a trough earlier this year and are high enough that sellers think they can get a good deal, but not so high as to deter potential buyers, said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at financial services firm Pickering Energy Partners.
Historically, big deals in the oil patch have come in waves. BP's $48.2 billion acquisition of Amoco in 1998 set off the deal bonanza that created the world's supermajors. More recently, after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, ConocoPhillips scooped up Concho Resources and Shell's Permian assets for almost $20 billion combined; Pioneer bought Parsley Energy and DoublePoint Energy for a combined $11 billion; Chevron snapped up Noble Energy for about $5 billion.
Pickering said a deal between Exxon and Pioneer would create new momentum for transactions in the Permian as it would demonstrate that even one of the largest U.S. producers has to build up its inventory, and that remaining resources in the most prolific basin in the nation are becoming scarce.
""When one company makes a big move, it forces everyone to think harder about where their chess pieces go,"" Pickering said. ""Will they miss something if they don't act relatively quickly?""
Lately in the oil patch, bigger companies have attracted an outsize portion of investors' capital. Last year, some of the largest institutional investors, including Capital Group, Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, increased their U.S. energy holdings to a combined $170 billion, up 27% from 2017.
But most of that investing benefited the five largest U.S. oil companies—Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and EOG Resources, as well as oil-field services giant Schlumberger—which together accounted for about $88 billion of the investment firms' holdings last year, up from $49 billion in 2017, according to an analysis by Kimmeridge.
The lack of available money is squeezing smaller players and prompting them to sell, investors said.
""At these [oil] prices, a lot of boardrooms are going to have to evaluate"" selling their companies over the next year, said Wil VanLoh, chief executive of private investment firm Quantum Energy Partners.
Such deals reduce the acquirer's borrowing costs, extend the lifespan of their remaining inventory of economic drilling locations and cut operating costs. ""There's a lot of industrial logic to it,"" he said.
A Pioneer tie-up would make Exxon by far the largest oil-and-gas producer in the contiguous U.S., almost 50% bigger than Chevron, which is currently the largest producer in the region, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.
Seeing Pioneer sell itself after a long history of scooping up smaller rivals in the Permian might trigger a panic among other industry players, said Alex Beeker, a Wood Mackenzie analyst.
""If there's any deal to trigger a bigger M&A wave, this might be it—watching Pioneer switch from a consolidator to a seller,"" Beeker said.

Exxon Mobil is closing in on a deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a blockbuster takeover that could be valued at roughly $60 billion and reshape the U.S. oil industry.
A deal could be sealed as soon as in the coming days, though it is still possible there won't be one, people familiar with the matter said.
After posting record profit for 2022, Exxon has been flush with cash and exploring options that would push it deeper into West Texas shale.
An acquisition of Pioneer, with a market cap of around $50 billion, would likely be Exxon's largest deal since its megamerger with Mobil in 1999. It would give Exxon a dominant position in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, a region the oil giant has said is integral to its growth plans.
The Wall Street Journal reported in April that the two companies were holding preliminary talks.
Exxon has a market value of more than $436 billion, so the deal, which would be the biggest takeover of the year, should be easily doable.
A deal would eclipse the U.S. oil industry's most recent blockbuster, Occidental Petroleum's 2019 acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum for about $38 billion, and top Exxon's 2010 purchase of XTO Energy for more than $30 billion.
It would also be a legacy-shaping move for Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods, whose tenure at the company has seen its peaks and valleys.
Woods, an Exxon lifer who became CEO in 2017, initially promised to dramatically expand Exxon's oil production only to see his plans felled by the global pandemic. An oil-market collapse in 2020 led to Exxon's first annual loss in decades -- more than $22 billion. It lost a historic proxy fight in 2021 to investment firm Engine No. 1, which excoriated Exxon's finances and argued it had no long-term strategy.
But Exxon rebounded to record profit of $55.7 billion last year, buoyed by soaring global demand for oil and gas as economies reopened. Exxon has used its prolific cash flows to reward investors with buybacks and dividends and pledged disciplined spending, though many wondered whether the company would dip into its coffers for a megadeal in the oil patch.
The acquisition marks Woods's second significant acquisition, coming only a few months after Exxon scooped up carbon-dioxide pipeline operator Denbury for $4.9 billion. It would add swaths of West Texas acreage considered the core of the U.S. shale boom.
Pioneer's acreage in the Midland Basin -- the eastern portion of the Permian Basin, which straddles West Texas and New Mexico -- is seen as one of the largest collections of fertile oil land in the U.S., and the company holds one of the largest numbers of untapped drilling locations of any Permian player, analysts have said.
After the pandemic, Pioneer snapped up two other large Permian operators, Parsley Energy and DoublePoint Energy, for a combined $11 billion in 2021.
Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield started work for predecessor company, Parker & Parsley Petroleum, in 1979. That company merged with another in 1997 to form Pioneer. He had retired in 2016 but returned in 2019.
In April, Sheffield had announced he would retire at the end of this year and that he would be succeeded by his longtime top lieutenant, Richard Dealy, the company's chief operating officer.
""I'm almost 71, we celebrated Pioneer's 25th anniversary last year,"" Sheffield told The Wall Street Journal in an interview in April. ""And so [the] timing was right.""
Pioneer's balance sheet has been in increasingly good shape since oil prices surged, with its debt declining more than 20% since the end of 2021, according to FactSet.
The tie-up could presage a wave of consolidation among shale companies. The industry has shifted from the rapid growth it pursued for more than a decade to a mature business underpinned by fiscal restraint and hefty investor payouts. But producers are contending with dwindling drilling locations. Drilling for new oil discoveries has fallen out of favor with investors, leaving many companies with few options other than to acquire rivals to extend their runway.
Producers have deep coffers at their disposal to pursue deals after Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year sent global prices soaring to more than $127 a barrel. Prices have retreated and been volatile since then.

Exxon's acquisition of Pioneer could be the first of a series of deals in the Permian, which contains shale wells that produce rapidly and don't bind companies to decadeslong megaprojects that have fallen out of favor with some investors who fear a future decline in oil demand.
Environmentalists, lawmakers and others have hoped oil and gas companies would invest their record profits into green energy. Woods has pledged Exxon will invest $17 billion through 2027 in cutting the company's carbon emissions and building a business that would help other companies reduce theirs too, investing in areas including carbon capture, biofuels and lithium mining.
Exxon's move to purchase Pioneer, even after its acquisition of Denbury, the CO2 pipeline operator, signals the company is still primarily planning to lean on its traditional oil-and-gas business for decades.

Oil stocks have quietly been the market leaders this summer—and they should have the energy to keep the streak going the rest of the year.
With technology stocks taking a break, the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLE) has been the best sector performer since the start of June, gaining 17% during that time. That's well ahead of the second-place sectors, consumer discretionary and industrials, each up 12%. All three sector rallies reflect improving investor sentiment on the U.S. and global economy and the market pricing in peak benchmark interest rates.
Energy stocks have other things working for them, too. Prices of crude and natural gas have been boosted by several moves on the supply side. Russia and Saudi Arabia continue to pursue voluntary production cuts , while workers at liquefied-natural-gas plants in Australia have threatened to strike, which could take more supply off the market. The U.S. price of crude oil has surged 19% since June 1, to around $81 a barrel, as the natural gas price has added 17%, to $2.80 per million British thermal units.
""Supply reductions (real, announced, or potential) and peak rates have pushed energy prices higher in the past three months,"" write BofA Securities commodity strategists. More signs of improving demand would help boost the oil price too, but with China's faltering recovery , that may be wishful thinking for now.
Rising oil prices have boosted energy stocks, and signs point to continued gains. While fewer than 15% of energy stocks in the S&P 500 index were above their 200-day moving averages earlier this year, the recent rally has pushed that percentage to greater than 90%. When that proportion of energy stocks has flipped so dramatically in that direction, the sector has been higher six months later in 21 out of 25 historical occurrences, according to data from Dean Christians, senior research analyst at SentimenTrader. While there have typically been some bumps along the way—and a dip in oil prices over the next few weeks shouldn't come as a surprise—energy stocks sported a median gain of 10% six months later.
Oil exploration-and-production companies look like the sweet spot for investors, rather than refiners, oil-field services providers, or other energy-related firms—and not just because of the higher price for the commodity they take out of the ground. Operating costs and capital expenditure requirements are coming down for many producers this year and next, as pandemic-related supply-chain and labor pressures ease. That means higher cash returns for investors, as was seen during second-quarter earnings season.
""The key learning from 2Q23 E&P earnings was clear signs of a comeback for U.S. shale,"" wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Arun Jayaram. ""The strong quarterly results were driven by better than expected well productivity trends, impressive drilling efficiency gains, and deflationary tailwinds, which are poised to improve capital efficiency in 2024.""
Jayaram upgraded shares of Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), a $55 billion independent shale oil and gas producer focused on West Texas' Midland Basin, to the equivalent of Buy from Neutral. He expects the company to increase its oil production by at least 5% next year without spending a penny more on capex. Productivity and efficiency gains are already under way: On Pioneer's second-quarter call, management increased its 2023 oil-production guidance by 1.2%, while also lowering its capex forecast by 3%.
Mizuho Securities USA's Nitin Kumar also has Pioneer as one of his top picks, and he recently upgraded producers Chevron (CVX), Matador Resources (MTDR), and Permian Resources (PR) to Buy, while lowering refiners Marathon Petroleum (MPC), HF Sinclair (DINO), and Magnolia Oil & Gas (MGY) to Neutral. ""Although near-term refining margins are likely strong, risk/reward is skewed to the downside and we move to the sidelines,"" Kumar wrote.
Stick with shares of companies pumping the sticky stuff.

Exxon Mobil and Chevron are hitting their financial targets and returning a growing amount of cash to shareholders, but Wall Street is barely shrugging.
Both companies beat earning expectations on Friday, paid out more than they did last year in dividends, and each said they are on track to buy back $17.5 billion worth of shares this year. But the stocks were hardly moving in early trading.
It's a sign of the ceiling the stocks now face with oil and gas prices falling from last year's levels. Oil has lately traded below $80 per barrel, versus prices above $100 last year at this time.
Chevron (ticker: CVX) reported earnings per share of $3.55 compared with a consensus call of $3.40. The shares fell 0.5% in premarket trading on Friday.
Exxon Mobil (XOM), the biggest U.S. oil company, reported earnings of $2.83 a share, compared with a consensus of $2.60. Its shares were up 0.7%.
There are signs of cost inflation that may be causing concern among investors.
Chevron's capital expenditures rose 55% above last year's levels, though its production fell by 2.6%. CFO Pierre Breber said in an interview with Barron's that the drop in production had to do with some discontinued operations, including a concession in Thailand it no longer operates. Its capital expenditures rose largely because it is expanding in the United States, with the expectation that its production in the Permian Basin will rise considerably in the second half of the year. Breber said that a small portion of the increase had to do with inflation.
""There's a lag between spending capital and seeing production,"" he said, noting that ""our Permian production is back-end loaded. You'll see that particularly in the second half of the year, and you'll see that in other parts of the portfolio.""
Exxon's production is on the rise, growing by 150,000 barrels per day in the latest quarter, or 4.2%, year over year. Its capital expenses rose 36%.
Chevron has been more aggressive than Exxon in its shareholder return policies, however. The company's goal of buying back $17.5 billion worth of shares per year would reduce its share count more than Exxon's because Chevron has a smaller market cap. And its dividend yield is 3.6% versus Exxon's at 3.1%.
Nonetheless both companies are now dealing with a different market than they faced last year: one with fewer clear opportunities for growth. They'll also have trouble topping their 2022 performances. Exxon was up 80% and Chevron 53%.
A year ago, the war in Ukraine drove Exxon's and Chevron's earnings to new heights. But oil prices have been headed lower even as the war drags on, as demand slackens around the world amid recession fears.
The forces that drove the stocks higher last year have dissipated, and investors are waiting for the next catalyst.
At a basic level, both Exxon and Chevron are in strong shape. They are much more efficient than they were before the pandemic, and are consistently increasing their dividends and buying back shares. But they are still having trouble attracting new investors because earnings are expected to flatten out over the next few quarters.
Although first-quarter earnings exceeded last year's levels, this could be the last quarter for at least a year where the companies post year-over-year gains. That's largely because of the decline in oil and gas prices, a factor the companies don't control.
One of the biggest questions from analysts in the coming quarter will be about mergers and acquisitions. Both companies are flush with cash, and analysts have been speculating about whether they're going to make deals to consolidate the industry and boost their inventories.
In the interview, Breber said that any deal would have to clear a ""very high bar"" because Chevron has other ways to grow.
""We have multiple growth assets—not just in the Permian, but the Gulf of Mexico growing 50% by 2026; Kazakhstan, where we've been investing for a number of years in a very large project, which will begin to start up towards the end of the year; and other shale and tight [formations], in particular, the DJ Basin in Colorado and in Argentina.""
That said, he expects the industry to eventually consolidate.
""We've talked about now that we think this industry will consolidate over time, as it has for the 34 years that I've been in the sector,"" he said. ""For a low-growth industry there are too many companies. And it's hard to find another low-growth industry that would have this many companies.""
Analysts are anticipating some deals in the near future.
Several producers ""could be acquired in the coming quarters given the desire for several companies like Exxon to boost inventory,"" Truist analyst Neal Dingmann wrote earlier this month. ""2023 has already started as an active year for upstream M&A and we believe things could remain as busy throughout the year.""
Given its strong balance sheet, Exxon is in a good spot to make acquisitions, wrote Citi analyst Alastair Syme. He thinks the company could even buy a European oil major.
""We continue to argue that trans-Atlantic M&A could bring huge financial accretion,"" he wrote after the earnings announcement. ""So too there lie potential value opportunities through scaling (i.e. acquisitions) within the highly fragmented Permian Basin where Exxo still only sits as the #4 player (measured by resources).""
Exxon has been talking to shale driller Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, although neither company has commented publicly about a possible deal. Exxon characterized it as ""market speculation or rumors."" Chevron made several acquisitions early in the pandemic, but has been quiet lately—focusing instead on ramping up its stock buybacks and boosting its dividend.
For the past three years, investors have mostly been negative on acquisitions because they feared buyers would pay too much. That could change, however, if they think that the major oil companies can purchase attractive properties at reasonable prices.
Not everyone expects deals, however. Pioneer Natural Resources CEO Scott Sheffield said in an interview with Barron's this week that he doesn't expect M&A in the near future, in part because acquiring companies seem unwilling to pay significant premiums.

Scott Sheffield, one of the most prominent oil executives in the U.S., plans to retire as chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. at year-end.
Richard Dealy, Pioneer's chief operating officer, will succeed Mr. Sheffield, who has led the driller for more than two decades over two stints as its CEO.
The announcement marks Mr. Sheffield's second retirement as the head of the company. Mr. Sheffield, 70 years old, previously retired in 2016, only to come back to helm Pioneer in 2019.
Under his leadership, the company morphed from a medium-size oil producer to one of the biggest U.S. shale companies. Pioneer, which used to operate from Alaska to Canada, is now solely focused on the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, where it holds vast reserves of oil and gas.
Pioneer's premier position in the Permian has made it one the most attractive acquisition targets in the region. Exxon Mobil Corp. has held preliminary talks with Pioneer about a possible acquisition, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Any deal, if it happens, likely wouldn't come together until later this year or next year and the early-stage talks may not morph into formal negotiations at all, the Journal reported.
Mr. Sheffield declined to say whether his pending departure signaled that a deal was more likely. ""You can look at it both ways,"" he said.
Mr. Sheffield became a strong voice within the oil industry, successfully pushing for lifting a ban on U.S. crude exports under the Obama administration and promoting shale as the future of U.S. oil and gas.
Mr. Dealy will officially become CEO on Jan. 1, 2024.

Scott Sheffield, one of the most prominent oil executives in the U.S., plans to retire as chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co. at the end of the year.
Richard Dealy, currently Pioneer's chief operating officer, will succeed Mr. Sheffield, who has led the driller for more than two decades over two stints as its CEO.
The announcement marks Mr. Sheffield's second retirement as the head of the company. Mr. Sheffield, 70, previously retired in 2016, only to come back to helm Pioneer in 2019.
Under his leadership, the company morphed from a medium-size oil producer to one of the biggest U.S. shale companies. Pioneer, which used to operate from Alaska to Canada, is now solely focused on the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, where it holds vast reserves of oil and gas.
Pioneer's premier position in the Permian has made it one the most attractive acquisition targets in the region, say analysts. Exxon Mobil Corp. has held preliminary talks with Pioneer about a possible acquisition , The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Any deal, if it happens, likely wouldn't come together until later this year or next year and the early-stage talks may not morph into formal negotiations at all, the Journal reported.
Mr. Sheffield declined in an interview to say whether his pending departure signaled that a deal was more likely. ""You can look at it both ways,"" he said.
Mr. Sheffield became a strong voice within the oil industry, successfully pushing for lifting a ban on U.S. crude exports under the Obama administration, and promoting shale as the future of U.S. oil and gas.
The announcement of his retirement came just after Pioneer reported a $1.2 billion profit for the first quarter of the year, down from about $2 billion for the same period last year. The company in 2022 had its most profitable year ever, netting about $7.8 billion on the back of high oil prices.
Mr. Sheffield said he made a commitment upon his return to the company to prepare a successor. ""I started working on succession day one,"" he said.
Pioneer was one of a number of smaller operators who in the early 2010s unlocked new troves of crude from the Permian's oil-saturated rock layers. In 2014, Mr. Sheffield told Forbes he believed the company could produce up to one million barrels a day within 10 years, up from about 200,000 barrels.
But after overseeing Pioneer's focus on rapidly increasing oil production, Mr. Sheffield in recent years led belt-tightening efforts to meet investors' demands for cash returns over growth. The company last year generated $8.4 billion in excess cash and returned almost all of it to investors via dividends and share repurchases. It produced an average of about 352,000 barrels of oil a day.
Mr. Dealy's future appointment comes as the Permian is likely to hit a production plateau later this decade, according to executives and analysts. Some frackers, including Pioneer, have said they are dealing with less productive wells. The company last year said it would reshuffle its drilling portfolio to generate higher returns in 2023, including by drilling longer horizontal wells.
Mr. Dealy will officially become chief executive officer on Jan. 1, 2024. He was appointed to his present role in 2021 after having served as chief financial officer. He joined Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., a predecessor of Pioneer, in 1992.
Mr. Dealy said that he would maintain the company's goals to modestly grow production and return cash to shareholders. ""My job, really, is to continue to execute on Pioneer's acreage,"" he said.
Mr. Sheffield is expected to continue to serve on the company's board following his retirement. He first joined Parker & Parsley as a petroleum engineer in 1979, climbing the company's ranks to become CEO in 1989, and CEO of Pioneer in 1997.
Mr. Sheffield said that after retiring, he would move back to Santa Fe, N.M., to focus on a charity called First Serve-New Mexico.

Exxon Mobil Corp.'s hunt for a blockbuster deal in U.S. shale could kick off a bonanza of deal making in the oil patch as drillers look to put large war chests of cash to work.
The oil giant has held preliminary talks with Pioneer Natural Resources Co., a Texas fracker with a roughly $52 billion market capitalization, about a potential acquisition, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. Exxon, which has been on the prowl in the Permian Basin for months, has also discussed a potential deal with at least one other company, the Journal reported.
Such a transaction would send the strongest signal yet that drillers in the Permian, the hottest U.S. oil field, are set to bulk up through acquisitions. Oil companies boast healthy balance sheets that give them the stomach and means to shop for targets.
The Journal reported there is no formal process between Exxon and Pioneer, and any deal, if it happens, likely wouldn't come together until later this year or next year. On Monday, the first day of trading since the Journal's story, Exxon's stock dropped less than 1% while Pioneer's stock jumped about 6%.
Investment bankers and analysts have said conditions are ripe for a deal frenzy in the oil patch this year.
The shale industry has shifted from the rapid growth it pursued for more than a decade to a mature business underpinned by fiscal restraint and hefty investor payouts. But shale companies are contending with dwindling drilling locations. Drilling for new oil discoveries has fallen out of favor with investors, leaving many companies with few options other than to acquire rivals to extend their runway.
""We think generally, there's more consolidation that's needed in our business,"" ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance told analysts in February.
Wall Street plowed money into several American frackers on Monday, including APA Corp., Coterra Energy Inc. and Diamondback Energy Inc., adding $7 billion to the collective market value of the 20 largest independent U.S. oil-and-gas companies. Shale stocks climbed even though oil prices declined about 1% Monday because investors were largely betting on an increase in oil mergers and acquisitions, said Neal Dingmann, an analyst at Truist Securities.
Thirst for growth led to a mergers-and-acquisitions boom in U.S. shale in the past decade. Between 2014 and 2019, the sector saw an average of 407 deals -- not restricted to M&A -- each year, with a total annual value averaging about $90 billion, according to investment bank Mizuho Securities.
But the pace of M&A slowed down after the pandemic gutted oil demand and stung companies' balance sheets. Drillers also tightened their belts to meet investors' demands for cash returns. There were, on average, 180 deals a year between 2020 and 2022 for $59 billion a year, according to Mizuho.
Now, producers have deep coffers at their disposal to pursue deals. Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year sent global prices soaring to more than $127 a barrel, translating into windfall profits for oil and gas.
The 10 largest U.S. publicly traded shale companies as of the end of last year earned more than $70 billion in profits in 2022, according to FactSet. Exxon netted $55.7 billion in profit, while Chevron Corp. raked in $35.5 billion.
The next wave of oil deal-making is likely to be set in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, say energy analysts and executives. Oil giants such as Exxon and Chevron favor the region for shale wells that produce rapidly and don't bind the companies to decadeslong megaprojects that have fallen out of favor with some investors who fear a future decline in oil demand.
If an oil company such as Exxon or Chevron snapped up a big Permian company, ""that could obviously ignite a speculative boom,"" said Adam Rozencwajg, a managing partner at investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg.
Exxon has invested heavily in the Permian over the past decade and continues to call it a key source of growth, alongside its massive oil discoveries in Guyana.
The company produced about 550,000 barrels a day on average last year in the Permian and said it plans to increase its output there to 1 million barrels a day by 2027.
But as the region matures, firms have been wrestling with disappointing wells. The average Permian well produced 5% less oil per lateral foot in 2022 compared with the previous year, according to research firm Enverus. In one part of the Permian, Exxon's 2022-vintage wells were 8.4% less productive than the prior year, according to Enverus data analyzed by JPMorgan Chase.
In addition to less-productive wells, operators are contending with shrinking inventories of drilling locations. Public companies and private operators in the Permian have less than eight years of their best locations remaining, investment bank Raymond James Financial estimated last year.
The double whammy creates incentives for companies to merge to gain new drilling opportunities and create economies of scale, executives and investors said.
Also whetting producers' appetite for deals is inflation, which has blunted companies' deployment of capital. The price of labor, steel and equipment has shot up, prompting companies to increase their spending by about 20% this year from 2022 without reaping additional barrels.
Nabbing a competitor allows drillers to augment production while keeping costs in check, said Muhammad Laghari, a senior managing director at investment bank Guggenheim Securities.
""M&A is probably right now, in this inflationary environment, the most cost-efficient way to increase your cash flow per share,"" he said.
While oil-price volatility in recent months complicated deals, the U.S. oil benchmark has dropped roughly $43 from its peak last June and is now in the $70 to $80 range, which supports negotiations between sellers and buyers, analysts said.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Texas-based oil major Exxon Mobil was once known for exploring for oil in all sorts of exotic places, but right now its own backyard is looking like the best option.
The company has reportedly held preliminary talks with U.S. producer Pioneer Natural Resources about a possible acquisition, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Friday. An acquisition of Pioneer, which has a market capitalization of about $49 billion, would be Exxon's largest deal since its merger with Mobil in 1999. It is clear Exxon is itching to put its cash to some use: The company is said to have approached Denbury, an oil producer with an extensive carbon-dioxide-gathering infrastructure, according to a Bloomberg report late last year.
Pioneer, which operates in the Midland Basin of the Permian, is the second-largest producer in that region by operated oil production based on figures last month, according to Enverus. Combined, Exxon and Pioneer produced roughly 1.2 million of oil-equivalent barrels a day from the Permian last year. A tie-up would create the largest producer in that basin, well surpassing current top producer Occidental Petroleum.
Its interest in Pioneer could be a case of fear of missing out. Notably, Occidental came to occupy that top Permian spot after outbidding Chevron to acquire Anadarko Petroleum in 2019. While that purchase was risky and expensive (it saddled Occidental with massive debt right before oil prices plunged in 2020), the acquisition started paying off handsomely in the past two years. Last year, Occidental's return on invested capital was 26.2%, exceeding Exxon's. Pioneer's returns were even higher than Occidental's. Good-quality acreage is important for U.S. producers; more mature U.S. shale plays -- including parts of the Permian -- have started reaching a production plateau, a point many U.S. producers stressed at an industry conference this year.
Whatever Exxon ends up buying, it will have to remember the lessons learned from its expensive, ill-timed $31 billion acquisition of natural-gas driller XTO Energy. When Exxon unveiled its plan to buy the company in December 2009, natural-gas prices averaged more than $5 per million British thermal units and Exxon was late to the shale oil and gas party. Natural-gas prices plunged and didn't recover above that level until 2021. Exxon said it would take a write-down on those natural-gas assets in 2020 -- to the tune of $17 billion to $20 billion.
At least this time there is something of a cushion against a rapid drop in oil prices: U.S. oil producers have shown remarkable financial restraint in how much to drill, and OPEC+ appears determined to retain its roughly $80-a-barrel floor on oil prices. And while there is no price tag on the potential deal, Pioneer's shares don't seem overly expensive: Even after a surge on Monday, its enterprise value as a multiple of forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is 5.51 times, about 9% below its five-year average and 7% cheaper than Exxon by the same measure.
However the deal talks shake out, Exxon's kicking the tires could indicate it is running out of blockbuster organic growth ideas. Guyana has proven to be a prolific find, but other explorations haven't been as successful. Notably, the oil major ended a drilling campaign offshore Brazil after failing to find commercially viable amounts of oil. Last year, Russia pushed Exxon out of a large oil-and-gas project in the country. Investors have been slower to reward major oil companies for large, risky projects.
Before the shale boom, ""peak oil"" had a different meaning -- not the world weaning itself off the fuel but failing to replace aging fields quickly enough. If Exxon's and other majors' growth starts looking more dependent on acquisitions rather than organic growth, that term might come back into vogue.

Pioneer Natural Resources surged Monday on a report that Exxon Mobil could acquire the fracker.
Exxon (ticker: XOM) has held informal discussions with Pioneer Natural (PXD) about a potential acquisition, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. Any deal wouldn't come together until the end of the year, and it is possible nothing comes from the discussions, according to the Journal.
Both Exxon and Pioneer told Barron's that they don't comment on market rumors or speculation.
Because the stock market was closed in observance of Good Friday, investors had their first chance to trade on the news on Monday. Shares of Pioneer Natural jumped 5.8% to $220.22 and it was the third-best performer in the S&P 500.
In a research note, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read wrote that ""with one of the largest and best acreage positions within the Permian Basin, merging with PXD could make strategic sense for many companies desiring a larger Permian footprint.""
The Permian Basin is an oil- and gas-producing area in West Texas and New Mexico. According to Pioneer Natural , the resources deep below the Permian's surface ""could rival the supply of what's now considered the world's largest oilfield in Saudi Arabia,"" and the company has made the decision to become a ""Permian pure-play company.""
Exxon considers the Permian to be one of the company's key growth areas as it pulls back from some other drilling projects. There are few companies with the kind of heft and profitability in the Permian to rival Pioneer—and a combination would make Exxon the largest producer in the region.
David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, which owns both companies, told Barron's that Pioneer has long been mentioned as a possible takeover candidate, so the latest news is no surprise. ""For the last five or six years, a thesis for an equity investor was that they would get bought out because the perception is they were one of the best operators,"" he said.
But he thinks Pioneer is unlikely to sell at or near current prices. ""It's really tough for me to think [Pioneer CEO] Scott Sheffield is gonna sell this company for below a value that it was traded at a year ago,"" he said.
Pioneer's 52-week high is $288, about 30% above Monday's prices. The stock has fallen 2.9% this year.
Pioneer is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on May 3. Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar, who rates the stock as a Buy with a $265 price target, wrote in a research note last week that the company ""is seeing no further increases in service costs due to inflationary pressures. However, they are not planning for any decreases in costs yet either.""

Whatever Exxon ends up buying, it will have to remember the lessons learned from its expensive, ill-timed $31 billion acquisition of natural-gas driller XTO Energy. When Exxon announced its plan to acquire the company in December 2009, natural-gas prices averaged more than $5 per million British thermal units and Exxon was late to the shale oil-and-gas party. Natural-gas prices subsequently plunged and didn't recover above that level until 2021. Exxon finally said it would take a write-down on those natural-gas assets in 2020—to the tune of $17 billion to $20 billion.
At least this time there is something of a cushion against a rapid drop in oil prices: U.S. oil producers have shown remarkable financial restraint in how much to drill, and OPEC+ appears determined to retain its roughly $80-a-barrel floor on oil prices. And while there is no price tag on the potential deal, Pioneer's shares don't seem overly expensive: Its enterprise value as a multiple of forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is 5.24 times, 13.5% below its five-year average and 12% cheaper than Exxon by the same measure.
However the deal talks shake out, Exxon's kicking the tires could also indicate that it is running out of blockbuster organic growth ideas. Guyana has proven to be a prolific find, but other explorations haven't been as successful. Notably, the oil major ended a drilling campaign offshore Brazil after failing to find commercially viable amounts of oil, as The Wall Street Journal reported. Last year, Russia pushed Exxon out of a large oil-and-gas project in the country. Investors have also been slower to reward major oil companies for large, risky projects.
Before the shale boom, ""peak oil"" had a different meaning–not the world weaning itself off the fuel but failing to replace aging fields quickly enough. If Exxon and other majors' growth starts looking more dependent on acquisitions rather than organic growth, that term might come back into vogue.

Exxon Mobil Corp. has held preliminary talks with Pioneer Natural Resources Co. about a possible acquisition of the U.S. fracking giant, as the oil company hunts for a blockbuster deal in the shale patch, according to people familiar with the matter.
Discussions between the two companies have been informal, the people said. But after posting record profits in 2022, Exxon is flush with cash and, according to people familiar with the company's plans, has been exploring options that could reshape a swath of the U.S. oil-and-gas industry while pushing Exxon deeper into West Texas shale.
Exxon executives have discussed a potential tie-up with at least one other company, people familiar with the matter said. Some of the people cautioned there is no formal process between Exxon and Pioneer.
Any deal, if it happens, likely wouldn't come together until later this year or next year, the people said, and talks may not morph into formal negotiations at all, or Exxon may pursue another company. But they said Exxon is on the hunt for a seismic deal to put its windfall profits to use and it sees Dallas area-based Pioneer as a top target.
An acquisition of Pioneer, with a market cap of around $49 billion, would likely be Exxon's largest since its megamerger with Mobil Corp. in 1999. It would give Exxon a dominant position in the oil-rich Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, a region Exxon has said is integral to its growth plans.
Pioneer's size would likely mean a deal larger than the U.S. oil industry's most recent blockbuster, Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s 2019 purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for about $38 billion, and top Exxon's 2010 acquisition of XTO Energy Inc. for more than $30 billion.
The potential megamerger would combine the largest Western oil company -- more than 140 years old and valued at more than $468 billion -- with a West Texas driller that holds vast reserves of oil in America's most-coveted fracking hot spot. Pioneer generated $8.4 billion in surplus cash last year and sent almost $8 billion of that to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.
Pioneer is the largest oil producer in the Permian; Exxon is the sixth-largest, according to analytics firm Novi Labs.
Exxon has been on the prowl for a purchase in the Permian for months, people familiar with the matter said. Its interest in doubling down on U.S. shale signals the Irving, Texas, oil giant may continue to tie its future fortunes to fossil fuels.
Many Western oil companies are retrenching globally, and large European rivals including Shell PLC and BP PLC have grappled with how to balance their fossil-fuel output with spending on renewable and low-carbon energy over the longer term.
Exxon's strategy to lean primarily on its oil-and-gas assets, including its big U.S. refineries, proved lucrative last year: It banked a historic profit of $55.7 billion, which made it one of America's most prosperous companies in fiscal 2022. Oil and natural-gas prices surged to multiyear highs following the onset of Russia's war in Ukraine.
At the same time, a move by Exxon to write a check for one of the biggest U.S. frackers would also show how its options for ensuring years of future oil-and-gas production have narrowed.
Oil companies of Exxon's scale have struggled in recent years to convince shareholders they should plow into megaprojects with decadeslong life cycles, due to concerns about an eventual decline in demand. Adding to that pressure, the Kremlin last year wiped out Exxon's stake in a large oil-and-gas project in Russia's Far East. It had taken a $3.4 billion accounting charge in the first quarter after declaring its plans to exit Russia.
Exxon has also ended a major drilling campaign in the deep waters of Brazil, after failing last year for a third time to find commercially viable amounts of oil, The Wall Street Journal reported this past week, citing people familiar with the matter.
Exxon said it was still engaged in Brazil. But the move marked a major setback in a country it has promoted for years as a source of growth.
The Permian has long been considered the domain of more nimble drillers that could exploit fast-declining shale wells quickly, while major oil companies traditionally have focused on more technically challenging projects. But the U.S. major oil companies have been attracted to the Permian for its ability to boost oil production quickly, which helps to offset declines in other parts of the world.
A large Permian deal could trigger a mergers race among oil companies in the region, according to investment bankers who expect more consolidation across the U.S. oil industry this year. A common refrain in the shale patch recently has been ""everyone is talking to everyone"" about deals.
Pioneer has some of the best assets in the Permian, according to analysts. Exxon would gain access to a vast catalog of drilling locations Pioneer amassed through the acquisitions of Parsley Energy Inc. and DoublePoint Energy, two companies that had also drilled in the Permian, for a combined roughly $11 billion in 2021.
Pioneer's predecessor company, Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., was founded in the early 1960s by two West Texas wildcatters. Pioneer's chief executive, Scott Sheffield, began working at Parker & Parsley in 1979 and later became its CEO and chairman. Parker & Parsley merged with another oil producer to form Pioneer in 1997.
Mr. Sheffield retired in 2016 but returned as CEO in 2019.
Pioneer produced an average of about 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day there in 2022, about 100,000 more than Exxon produced in the region last year, according to company filings. Pioneer executives said the company sits on about 30 years of premium inventory.

Some of the biggest outperformers in the U.S. energy sector—Pioneer Natural Resources and Devon Energy—cut their dividend payouts in the latest quarter as oil prices caused cash flow to slip.
The cuts were expected, and aren't a sign of problems with either company, but they may be a test for investors who have become accustomed to steady growth in dividends for the past two years.
Devon (ticker: DVN) and Pioneer (PXD) announced in 2020 that they each would try a new way of paying profits back to shareholders, dividends that change based on how much cash the companies make each quarter. The companies pay small base dividends, and add variable dividends that change based on results and the balance sheets.
Those payouts have been growing steadily since 2021, as oil prices have soared. But in the latest quarter, the two companies reported total dividend payouts that were considerably below their second-quarter dividends.
Pioneer announced a total dividend of $5.71 per share, 33% below its second-quarter payout. At those levels, the stock's annualized dividend yield is still 9%, well above competitors and more than twice as high as the broader S&P 500. But shareholders don't seem pleased with the smaller dividend. Pioneer's shares have fallen 6% since the announcement. That's a small drop given that Pioneer has more than doubled since the start of 2021. But it could signal a change in sentiment for a stock whose dividend has been a big attraction.
Devon announced late Tuesday that it will pay out $1.35 per share, down from $1.55 per share in the second quarter. On an annualized basis, its latest dividend yield is 7%. The drop in the dividend doesn't look like the main reason why Devon's shares were down 8% on Wednesday—the company's fourth-quarter guidance was disappointing—but it can't have helped either. Shares are still up 360% since the start of 2021.
The benefit of a variable dividend strategy is that shareholders get to participate directly in a surge of cash flow when times are good, while the company can avoid committing to a large regular payout that will be at risk when times get worse. For companies with large regular dividends, a plunge in oil prices can force them to cut the payout—a move that tends to cause stock prices to tumble. Several oil companies, including Shell (SHEL), cut their dividends in 2020. Shell has raised the dividend since.
There are downsides to variable dividends, though. Analysts note that a steady regular dividend is a sign to investors that a company stands behind its balance sheet, and is managing for good times and bad. Investors can buy a well-capitalized stock knowing they are locking in a dividend yield that's not going anywhere, whether or not oil prices rise.
For Pioneer and Devon, variable dividends have helped them stand out from the pack of shale-oil producers, attracting investors who have profited from the rise in commodity prices. As those dividends shrink, that competitive advantage could shrink, too.

Many energy company's stocks—and their dividends—took a big hit earlier in the pandemic, even those of large firms. The global economy contracted along with oil and gas prices, forcing many companies in the oil patch to guard their capital.
Hence a wave of dividend cuts across the energy sector, at the expense of income investors. Halliburton (ticker: HAL) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) are just a couple of the big names that made such cuts.
We went looking for energy companies in the S&P 500 that raised their dividends earlier in the pandemic, specifically in 2020 and 2021. Being able to boost a dividend in such a distressed period is a good starting point for how well a company can weather such periods and have the wherewithal to keep raising payouts.
Among the 21 energy companies in the S&P 500, only about half managed to pay out a higher dividend over the previous year in 2020 and 2021. That was the takeaway from a recent stock screen Barron's ran.
We added one other criteria: The company's market capitalization had to be above $50 billion. That ultimately narrowed the list of qualifying companies to Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), and ConocoPhillips (COP).
Energy companies in general, even if they didn't make this list, have been paying more attention to returning capital to shareholders.
While the price of oil ""has corrected from highs, [energy companies] are all still making a ton of money and have taken that money to give it back to shareholders in dividend increases, buybacks and special dividends,"" says Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors.
Some companies narrowly missed the list Barron's compiled. If a company merely maintained its dividend in 2020, for example, it wasn't included, as we wanted to see increases in 2020 and 2021.
For a while, it looked as though Exxon Mobil wasn't going to boost its dividend in 2021. It declared a quarterly dividend increase in April of 2019, raising the payout to 87 cents a share from 82 cents.
The company didn't increase it in 2020, though the total it paid out for the calendar year, $3.48 a share, was slightly above the previous year's amount, $3.43. Its quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share, put through in April of 2019, enabled the 2020 payout to exceed the previous year's total by 5 cents.
That also allowed Exxon to stay in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, whose members have paid out a higher dividend for at least 25 straight years.
In 2021, the company paid $3.49 a share in dividends, compared with $3.48 the previous year. It boosted its quarterly dividend by a penny , to 88 cents a share, last fall.
Earlier in the pandemic, however, there was concern that the energy giant could cut its dividend as it wasn't generating enough free cash flow to cover the payout.
In October of 2020, for example, the stock on a 12-month trailing basis was yielding more than 10%, according to FactSet. But it has moved down considerably since then, helped by much stronger energy prices. The stock now yields about 3.7%—still attractive but well below distress levels.
Another energy giant, Chevron, never had its dividend yield spike as much as Exxon Mobil's did—though it did rise to about 7% in October of 2020. The company paid a dividend of $5.31 a share last year, up a respectable 3% from 2020 levels.
Due to the volatility of their earnings in recent years, some energy companies are now paying variable dividends as a way to hedge their capital-return policies.
In May, for example, ConocoPhillips declared an ordinary dividend of 46 cents a share and a variable return of cash of 30 cents a share. The firm is among the exploration-and-production companies, which typically aren't as big and global as the do-it-all giants, such as Exxon and Chevron.
Another E&P firm, Pioneer Natural Resources, also uses a base-plus variable dividend structure. That helped lift the total payout to $6.83 a share last year, up from $2.20 in 2020.
The stock was recently yielding 9.8%, the highest of the four companies spotlighted by this screen.
An Aug. 29 Morgan Stanley research note points out that Pioneer is committed to investing 65% to 75% of its cash flow on capital spending but keeping its production growth to 5%.
""The company intends to grow its base dividend while distributing cash windfalls via variable dividend,"" the note observes.
Big energy companies like these four certainly will have their ups and downs, especially if a recession ensues. But they've shown in recent years that their dividends are pretty durable, even in tough circumstances.

What was already going to be a challenging year for investors was further disrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But in a market that has been lacking in certainty, income investors may want to take a look at energy stocks.
Energy has been the best-performing sector in the S&P 500 index this year, with the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLE) climbing 20% this year—far outpacing the 11% drop in the broader index. Even with those gains, investors still have reason to pile into the sector—and not just because of the impact of Russian aggression on commodity prices.
""We have been extremely positive on energy as part of the reflation and recovery trade,"" Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, tells Barron's. He cites the sector's strong balance sheets, shrinking debt costs, and widening profit margins as reasons for the optimism.
Put another way, it's the exact opposite of what the industry faced in early 2016, when oil was below $30 a barrel and many smaller exploration-and-production companies found themselves on the brink of bankruptcy. Since then, the industry has learned to be profitable at $30 a barrel, leaving even more room for it to return capital to shareholders as prices hover around $100 barrel.
""What has certainly become the name of the game is shareholder value,"" Neal Dingmann, analyst at Truist, tells Barron's. The SPDR ETF currently yields 3.9%, but when factoring in the sector's increasing capacity for dividends and buybacks, the all-inclusive yield for some companies could be in excess of 7%, he says.
Normally such high yields would be of concern to investors, who would wonder if they would get stuck in a value trap, but leverage in the energy sector has been coming down for some time. Net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, hovers around 1.5 times and is falling for many of the companies that Dingmann covers. Roughly 20% of those companies are leveraged in excess of two times.
But these high yields are particularly attractive to income-starved investors who haven't been able to catch a break over the past several years, as interest rates have been low. And their attention should only grow now that hopes of more hawkish Federal Reserve boosting some sectors of the economy—particularly financials—were put on pause this past week, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine makes it less likely that the central bank will lift rates aggressively when it meets next month.
Earlier in February, Devon Energy (DVN), which has a dividend yield of 5%, declared a record-high dividend of $1 a share based on its fourth-quarter performance. It added that 50% of excess free cash flow will be returned to shareholders through a variable quarterly dividend. In addition to its dividend increase, Devon said that it increased its share-repurchase authorization by 60%, to $1.6 billion.
Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) is another stock for investors to watch. The Irving, Texas–based exploration-and-production company currently yields 2.5%. Last quarter, it paid out 101% of its free cash flow to investors and repurchased $250 million of stock, in what company executives called ""opportunistic"" use of capital given the company's low debt burden. It has since increased its share repurchase authorization to $4 billion.
While many of these announcements come amid the backdrop of oil rushing toward $100 a barrel or more, analysts still see healthy payouts if the price of oil were to fall in the $70-to-$80 a barrel range.
It may not be a good time to be an energy consumer, but it may be time to be an investor.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Investors are demanding more from oil companies this year: more spending discipline, more cash returns, more details around energy transition strategies. They should add one more thing to the list: more humility.
After an auspicious year, a group of producers tracked by Raymond James reduced the share of production they hedged using derivatives by nearly a half for 2022 compared with this year. No wonder. With oil and natural-gas prices recently hitting multiyear highs, this wasn't a great year for energy companies to lock in the price at which they sold those commodities.
Pioneer Natural Resources, which estimated it had a roughly $2 billion loss through Sept. 30 as a result of hedges, said during an earnings call in November that it will have very minimal hedging in 2022, pointing to the management's bullish view on oil prices. Chief Operating Officer Richard Dealy said on the call that his team thinks ""there's more room to move up than down.""
Yet history shows that an explicit view on oil prices is exactly the wrong reason to put on or take off hedges.
There are broadly two reasons for a producer to lock in prices. One is that it is required to do so because banks won't extend loans otherwise. Occidental, which typically hadn't hedged in prior years, fell into this camp after its expensive Anadarko Petroleum acquisition in 2019 left it heavily leveraged. There is a reason this tends to happen with poor timing: After a year of low oil prices, energy producers tend to rack up more debt, forcing some to hedge more output the year after. In a year when prices rebound strongly (as they did in 2021), they end up forgoing a lot of revenue. But in such cases, ""investors can't get that upset for some hedge losses,"" noted Alex Beeker, research director at Wood Mackenzie.
Harder to justify is the kind of hedging strategy that reflects a producer's bet on the direction of commodity prices. Companies have a poor record of predicting them.
Consider a group of oil-heavy producers that have investment-grade ratings -- companies that wouldn't be forced by banks to hedge. In 2018, they increased their hedging positions to 38% of production from 34% after seeing West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices hover below $50 a barrel for a good part of 2017, according to data from Wood Mackenzie analyzed by The Wall Street Journal.
When oil prices rebounded in 2018, those producers had collectively forfeited $820 million worth of revenue as a result of hedges, according to Wood Mackenzie estimates. This year, the same basket of companies lost out on $3 billion of revenue because of their decision to keep 32% of their volumes hedged.
A comparison of two companies makes a clear case for a consistent hedging strategy. From 2016 to 2021, EOG Resources' hedging (as a percentage of production) stayed relatively constant, ranging from a low of 9% to a high of 23%. In fact, it was one of the companies with the lowest variance among those tracked by Wood Mackenzie. Pioneer Natural Resources had the highest variance (ranging from 12% to 100%). Over that period, EOG actually racked up a cumulative hedging gain of $368 million, by Wood Mackenzie estimates, whereas Pioneer saw $1 billion worth of hedging losses. Comparing the six years starting 2016 is a relatively balanced period because there were two ""good"" years (2018 and 2021) when the average WTI oil price exceeded $60 a barrel, two years when they hovered around shale producers' average break-even price of $50 (2017 and 2019), and two ""bad"" ones when prices were close to $40 or below (2016 and 2020).
There are two schools of thought on how companies should hedge, according to Philip Verleger, energy economist with PKVerleger. One is to forgo hedging altogether so that the producer, over time, reaps both the benefits and losses of fluctuating commodity prices. Major oil companies, with their large balance sheets, tend to eschew hedges, letting the chips fall where they may. The second is to have a continuous hedging strategy that doesn't stop and start based on views of the commodity market. Given the unpredictable nature of the commodity market, companies that hedge based on their views lose money over time without exception, said Paul Cheng, analyst at Scotiabank.
In its last earnings call in early November, EOG's management noted that its hedging strategy hadn't changed, saying ""in general, we like to have a bit of hedges put on, whether oil or gas, to just give us a little bit of line of sight into our budgeting process.""
Oilmen may be good at finding crude, but not at guessing which way its price will move.

Investors are demanding more from oil companies this year: More spending discipline, more cash returns , more details around energy transition strategies . They should add one more thing to the list: More humility.
After an auspicious year, a group of producers tracked by Raymond James reduced the share of production they hedged using derivatives by nearly a half for 2022 compared with this year. No wonder. With oil and natural gas prices recently hitting multiyear highs, this wasn't a great year for energy companies to lock in the price at which they sold those commodities.
Pioneer Natural Resources, which estimated that it had made a roughly $2 billion loss through Sept. 30 due to hedges, said during an earnings call earlier this month that it will have very minimal hedging in 2022, pointing to the management's bullish view on oil prices. Chief Operating Officer Richard Dealy said on the call that his team thinks ""there's more room to move up than down."" Yet history shows that an explicit view on oil prices is exactly the wrong reason to put on or take off hedges.
There are broadly two reasons for a producer to lock in prices. One is that it is required to do so because banks won't extend loans otherwise. Occidental, which typically hadn't hedged in prior years, fell into this camp after its expensive Anadarko Petroleum acquisition in 2019 left it heavily leveraged . There is a reason this tends to happen with poor timing: After a year of low oil prices, energy producers tend to rack up more debt, forcing some to hedge more output the year after. In a year when prices rebound strongly (as they did in 2021), they end up forgoing a lot of revenue. But in such cases, ""investors can't get that upset for some hedge losses,"" noted Alex Beeker, research director at Wood Mackenzie.

US oil producers are not able to increase supply to tame soaring crude prices that remain ""under Opec control"", according to the shale patch's biggest operator.
Brent crude rose to $82 a barrel for the first time in three years yesterday after the expanded Opec+ alliance, which includes Russia, declined to accelerate plans to increase crude production, deepening a global energy crunch that has already pushed natural gas and coal prices in Europe and Asia to record highs. US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate rose above $78 a barrel for the first time in seven years.
But Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Texas-based Pioneer Natural Resources, said America's once-prolific shale producers would keep using their burgeoning cash piles to pay shareholders, not fund new drilling.
""Everybody's going to be disciplined, regardless whether it's $75 Brent, $80 Brent or $100 Brent,"" Sheffield said.
""All the shareholders that I've talked to said that if anybody goes back to growth, they will punish those companies. I don't think the world can rely much on US shale. It's really under Opec control.""
Pioneer bought two rival Texas producers this year, making it the prolific Permian Basin's biggest single oil producer with output of almost 360,000 barrels a day — more than some of the smaller member countries of the Opec oil cartel. It has said it will cap any output increase next year at 5 per cent, well beneath the double-digit rates of previous years.
The Pioneer chief's comments come as the US government puts pressure on
Saudi Arabia, Opec's de facto leader, to increase crude supply to keep further energy price inflation in check.
The group last year agreed deep production cuts to restore crude prices that plunged as pandemic lockdowns hit energy consumption.
But supplies are now short of demand as economies recover, with global crude stockpiles shrinking at a record pace, according to Goldman Sachs. Last week the bank raised its end-of-year Brent forecast from $80 to $90 a barrel.
Some analysts say that the gas crunch hitting Europe and Asia could spill over into markets for liquid fuels, pushing up demand for crude this winter as industries burn more oil to generate electricity. Opec+ agreed in July to add back 400,000 b/d each month until the end of 2022, but some analysts say that supplies must rise more quickly to staunch further price inflation.
US national security adviser Jake Sullivan discussed oil prices with Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince, last week, according to the White House.
Sheffield said that while the Biden administration was calling on Opec to increase supplies, it was trying ""to slow down US drilling in any way they can"" through moves such as a moratorium on leasing federal lands for drilling.
""They'd rather import crude oil from Opec,"" he said.
Soaring shale production in the past decade made the US the world's biggest crude producer, pumping almost 13m barrels a day in late 2019. But years of debt-fuelled drilling exhausted some fields, say operators, and angered investors, leaving the sector vulnerable when the pandemic struck in 2020. The price collapse forced producers to slash capital spending and idle rigs.
Drilling activity has begun to pick up — leading some analysts to predict modestly increasing output — but production remains almost 15 per cent below the pre-pandemic peak.
Sheffield said the dealmaking in the Permian would also temper producers' responses to rising prices.
""There's only four or five companies that have core [acreage],"" and shale would never again hit the annual growth of around 1.5m b/d seen in previous years, he said.
""Maybe a million, at top, for a couple of years,"" he added.

But years of debt-fuelled drilling exhausted some fields, say operators, and angered investors, leaving the sector vulnerable when the pandemic struck in 2020. The price collapse forced producers to slash capital spending and idle rigs.
Drilling activity has begun to pick up — leading some analysts to predict modestly increasing output — but production remains almost 15 per cent below the pre-pandemic peak.
Sheffield said the dealmaking in the Permian would also temper producers' responses to rising prices.
""There's only four or five companies that have core [acreage],"" and shale would never again hit the annual growth of around 1.5m b/d seen in previous years, he said.
""Maybe a million, at top, for a couple of years,"" he added.

After years of outspending their cash production, oil companies are now living within their means. Many are generating enough cash flow to cover their debt, dividends, and production budgets with room to spare. It doesn't hurt that oil and gas prices have rebounded and are trading at multiyear highs .
Investors have been rewarding companies that are doing a particularly good job of pumping out free cash flow and increasing their shareholder returns.
Barron's screened for the companies that are expected to increase their free cash flow the most in the next quarter from the last quarter. We looked at energy companies with market caps over $5 billion in the S&P 1500. The six top performers were Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Range Resources (RRC), EOG Resources(EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Devon Energy (DVN), and Cimarex Energy (XEC).
Natural gas prices have jumped to seven-year highs above $5 a million British thermal units, or BTUs. Gas inventories have been running low, as some companies have cut back on production and demand improves. On Monday, prices were up 7.7%. The upswing has lifted several natural gas producers . Cabot Oil & Gas, which is based in Houston but produces mostly in Appalachia, is expected to pump out significantly more free cash flow in the current quarter than it did in the prior one. Its stock has shot 40% higher in the past month.
For natural gas companies, their ability to benefit from price increases depends on whether they had previously hedged their production at lower prices. Those that hedge less production will be able to turn more of that price increase into cash. As of February, Cabot had hedged a little less than half of its 2021 production. But it had not hedged its 2022 production as of the end of the second quarter. Cabot CEO Dan Dinges said on the company's latest earnings call that it might do so before the end of the year, though investors are unlikely to know the extent of those hedges until the company's next earnings call.
Range Resources, another natural gas producer that extracts gas in Appalachia, has benefited from the price increase, with its stock rising 44% in a month. Range had already hedged some of its 2022 production, but had also left some unhedged to get the benefit of higher prices.
Oil prices have also been on the upswing lately, and U.S. producers are seeing major benefits. Among those are EOG, Pioneer Natural Resources, Devon Energy, and Cimarex Energy. All of those companies have participated in mergers, acquisitions, or land deals over the past year, bolstering their positions as the oil-and-gas industry consolidates. (EOG has not made any big deals, but has done some smaller acquisitions.) Most of those deals were stock transactions, meaning the companies did not add debt. Their hope is that they can add to production without also adding leverage — which has been a problem in the past.
Two companies on this list may soon become one. Cimarex plans to merge with Cabot in an all-stock deal that shareholders are expected to vote on this week.

US oil production is set to pick up steam, this time led by little-known, privately owned companies impervious to the demands of the stock market.
Forecasters project that the nation's crude oil output will increase by about 800,000 barrels a day over the course of 2022, accelerating sharply from this year and making the US the fastestgrowing supplier outside a producer alliance that includes members of the Opec cartel.
Marquee companies are not driving the rise.
Raoul LeBlanc, an analyst at IHS Markit, said that privately held producers, often smaller groups, would account for more than half of total US output growth next year compared with about 20 per cent in a typical year.
The projected output gains come as
US oil prices hover at about $70 a barrel, making most shale wells profitable to drill.
Many of the largest producers have promised shareholders that they will cap spending on growth after racking up huge losses during a decade-long drilling binge.
Private companies, by contrast, have led the rise in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US this year, which has more than doubled from this time last year.
The businesses include larger producers such as Endeavor Energy Resources and Tap Rock Resources along with scores of tiny groups.
LeBlanc said: ""The privates are not on board with this whole capital discipline thing. For them, this is their window. They're thinking, 'Here's my chance and I'm going to take advantage of it.' They see it as maybe their last best chance.""
Prolific output from shale oilfields bolstered the US as an oil producer, but the onset of the pandemic hollowed out oil demand and crushed prices, forcing US producers to throttle back production from a peak of about 13m b/d in late 2019 to about 11.1m b/d by the end of last year.
The US Energy Information Adminis- tration expects domestic crude production to begin to climb this autumn after Hurricane Ida disrupted offshore supplies, eventually reaching about 12.2m b/d by the end of 2022.
Spending on drilling and bringing new wells into production in shale patches onshore will rise from about $65bn in 2021 to more than $80bn next year as activity picks up and some drillers start to see cost inflation, LeBlanc has suggested.
The return of US growth would influence oil market balances at a time many are warning of tight supplies.
Saudi Arabia, Russia and others in the Opec+ group of 23 oil-producing nations are adding about 400,000 b/d of supply to the market each month as they unwind historic cuts that were made last year.
Bank of America is forecasting about 800,000 b/d of new supply from the US in 2022, which it says will ease supply concerns. However, the lender said last week that oil markets remained tight, and even with a strong US rebound, crude prices should stay above the $70 a barrel level next year and potentially shoot as high as $100 a barrel.
Publicly listed independent producers have mounted a smaller recovery than private groups, while majors such as ExxonMobil and Chevron have been slow to bring investment back to their US shale businesses.
Last year's downturn accelerated a strategic shift among leading publicly listed US shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources, Devon Energy and Diamondback Energy. They have been under pressure from shareholders to put profits over production increases and direct cash flow to newly created dividend schemes and paying down debt.
""Getting into 2022, we do expect we're going to limit our growth to 5 per cent,"" Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, the largest producer in the Permian region, said at an industry conference this month. ""We're going to see the market start to get tight. There's less investment on the supply side. We don't have US shale growth any more.""
While top US oil producers have stuck to their shareholder-friendly strategies, their share prices continue to languish.
The XOP, an exchange-traded fund considered a proxy for listed US oil and gas exploration and production groups, has fallen nearly 6 per cent compared with an 8 per cent rise in US crude oil prices since mid-March.
It has also posted lower returns than the broader S&P 500 stock index over that period.
There was still a ""healthy level of scepticism"" from public shareholders that the sector's reforms would stick after a ""decade of disappointment"", and emissions concerns would probably keep some investors away for good, said Matt Portillo, director of research at Tudor Pickering & Holt, a Houstonbased investment bank.
But Portillo saw the tide turning as a combination of higher prices and continued producer capital discipline repaired the sector's reputation. ""There's going to be very fairly significant shifts in sentiment in this space, as we've seen in other sectors"" that have gone through changes in business model, he said.'The privates are not on board with this whole capital discipline thing.

A wave of dealmaking in America's shale patch is intensifying, wiping out weak performers and leaving the oncefractured sector in the hands of a new breed of ""super independents"".
More than $30bn in oil and gas deals were done in the second quarter and analysts and bankers expect the run of dealmaking to continue. Investors are pushing shale producers to bulk up in the hopes that larger operators will rein in rampant supply growth, deliver better returns and clean up the industry's operations amid mounting environmental pressures.
""We have way too many players in the sector that are way too undercapitalised and too small to drive the efficiencies and returns that investors need, so we will continue to see consolidation happen,"" said Stephen Trauber, a vice-chair and veteran energy banker at Citi.
""If you're below a $10bn market cap, it is going to be hard for you to sustain yourself long term,"" he added.
Only a handful of shale specialists are in that $10bn club today, including larger producers ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources. Below them is a still deeply fractured corporate landscape with dozens of smaller private and publicly held producers that have carved up the country's largest oilfields, resulting, analysts say, in huge oversupply and high costs.
The $33bn in deals in the second quarter was the highest quarterly total since the second quarter of 2019, when Occidental Petroleum bought Anadarko for $55bn, according to data from Enverus, an industry consultancy. There has been more than $85bn in deals over the past 12 months as the sector has emerged from a pandemic-driven crash that decimated its finances.
Andrew Dittmar, lead M&A analyst at Enverus, said ""driving factors"" behind the recent wave of deals were still in place and shale producers had ""prioritised consolidation"" as the sector looked to draw investors back.
He added that public companies had recently turned their attention to buying private equity-backed producers. In
April, Pioneer Natural Resources bought DoublePoint Energy, backed by Houston-based energy investment firm Quantum Energy Partners, for $6.4bn in the biggest such deal.
Scott Sheffield, Pioneer's chief executive, said at the time that the deal, which made his company the largest producer in the prolific Permian oilfield in Texas, would deliver ""significant benefits of scale"" while the company planned to tame DoublePoint's rapid growth.
Private equity groups pumped tens of billions of dollars into the shale sector in the early and mid-2010s. But many have found it difficult to exit their positions, especially as public markets soured on the industry, which has generated hefty losses for shareholders.
""Pulling off an IPO is exceptionally hard, we've seen one in the last five years,"" said Dittmar of Enverus. ""Even they struggled out of the gate so there's not a lot of welcome in equity markets for new companies.""
The recent rise in US crude prices to about $70 a barrel is a potentially attractive exit point for private companies, analysts say. This is especially so as many of those energy-focused private equity shops are shifting their focus to low-carbon technologies, where markets are booming in what many see as an echo of the shale frenzy a few years ago.
""Private equity is doing one of two things,"" said Trauber of Citi. ""Either merging among themselves to get bigger to ultimately sell to a big public company, or selling directly to a public company, if they have the quality and size now.""
Regulatory and investor demands for oil and gas producers to cut their emissions are also expected to fuel the industry's consolidation as larger groups have more financial capacity to invest in pollution mitigation. A Dallas Federal Reserve survey last year found that just 10 per cent of smaller companies had a plan to cut their carbon emissions, while 50 per cent of their bigger rivals did.
While green pressures push some shale groups to merge, US supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron are expected to remain on the sidelines for now.
Both groups lost big climate-focused shareholder votes this year and are under pressure to step up investments in low-carbon technologies. Doing a major shale deal now would send the ""wrong signal"", said one energy banker.
Still, there are plenty of large independents that want to set themselves up for the long haul, which means getting bigger. ""We're headed towards a more consolidated industry,"" said Dittmar.
""It's just a matter of the pacing that we get there.""

A wave of dealmaking in America's shale patch is intensifying, wiping out weak performers and leaving the oncefractured sector in the hands of a new breed of ""super independents"".
More than $30bn in oil and gas deals were done in the second quarter and analysts and bankers expect the run of dealmaking to continue. Investors are pushing shale producers to bulk up in the hopes that larger operators will rein in rampant supply growth, deliver better returns and clean up the industry's operations amid mounting environmental pressures.
""We have way too many players in the sector that are way too undercapitalised and too small to drive the efficiencies and returns that investors need, so we will continue to see consolidation happen,"" said Stephen Trauber, a vice-chair and veteran energy banker at Citi.
""If you're below a $10bn market cap, it is going to be hard for you to sustain yourself long term,"" he added.
Only a handful of shale specialists are in that $10bn club today, including larger producers ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources and Pioneer Natural Resources. Below them is a still deeply fractured corporate landscape with dozens of smaller private and publicly held producers that have carved up the country's largest oilfields, resulting, analysts say, in huge oversupply and high costs.
The $33bn in deals in the second quarter was the highest quarterly total since the second quarter of 2019, when Occidental Petroleum bought Anadarko for $55bn, according to data from Enverus, an industry consultancy. There has been more than $85bn in deals over the past 12 months as the sector has emerged from a pandemic-driven crash that decimated its finances.
Andrew Dittmar, lead M&A analyst at Enverus, said ""driving factors"" behind the recent wave of deals were still in place and shale producers had ""prioritised consolidation"" as the sector looked to draw investors back.
He added that public companies had recently turned their attention to buying private equity-backed producers. In
April, Pioneer Natural Resources bought DoublePoint Energy, backed by Houston-based energy investment firm Quantum Energy Partners, for $6.4bn in the biggest such deal.
Scott Sheffield, Pioneer's chief executive, said at the time that the deal, which made his company the largest producer in the prolific Permian oilfield in Texas, would deliver ""significant benefits of scale"" while the company planned to tame DoublePoint's rapid growth.

| Jump to first hit A cadre of oil companies, seeing continued profits in shale, are mulling Royal Dutch Shell's holdings in the largest US oil field as the European giant considers an exit from the Permian Basin, Reuters reported, quoting market experts.The potential sale of Shell's Permian holdings, located in Texas, would be a litmus test of whether rivals are willing to bet on shale's profitability through the energy transition to reduce carbon emissions. Shell would follow in the footsteps of other producers, including Equinor and Occidental Petroleum that have shed shale assets this year, looking to cut debt and reduce carbon output in the face of investor pressure. Shell, which declined to confirm a Reuters report on Sunday that it was weighing the blockbuster sale of its Texas shale assets, also did not comment for this story.To showcase its 260,000 acres (105,200 hectares) in the Permian, Shell has opened a data room, according to two people familiar with the matter. ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Chevron Corp, EOG Resources and some private equity houses are all potential bidders for some or all of Shell's Permian assets, according to analysts. ConocoPhillips and Chevron declined to comment and the others did not immediately respond to requests for comment. US oil output is still roughly 2 million barrels per day below its all-time record production of nearly 13 million bpd hit before the coronavirus pandemic that made it the world's top producer.Oil prices have rebounded in 2021 with fuel demand rising as the pandemic ebbs. Benchmark US crude futures are up 49 per cent this year to nearly $72 per barrel, more than double their 2020 lows. Against this backdrop, estimates for Shell's acreage run from $7 billion to over $10 billion, the latter implying a valuation of almost $40,000 an acre. That would be in line with the per-acre price Pioneer Natural Resources paid for DoublePoint Energy in April, the most costly deal since a 2014-2016 rush by producers to grab positions in the Permian. Most Permian deals this year have closed between $7,000 and $12,000 per acre, said Andrew Dittmar, senior mergers and acquisitions analyst at data provider Enverus.A cash deal seems preferable for Shell, which could deploy the proceeds into debt reduction or clean-energy investments. To increase the number of bidders, Shell could accept shares in the buyer or divide the land into multiple packages, people familiar with the process said.LIKELY SUITORS ConocoPhillips owns acreage close to Shell's holdings and analysts say it is a top contender for the assets. Rival Chevron also has nearby operations that could make a deal attractive, said Artem Abramov, of Rystad Energy.Devon Energy is likely the smallest company that could bid on the acreage, according to analysts. Sven Del Pozzo, analyst at IHS, said the assets could be valuable to the Oklahoma City-based company. The company declined to comment. Smaller competitors are less likely to buy the assets because of the size of the sale, analysts said, and because acquisition financing is limited since last year's oil price crash.""Financing of fossil fuels is under massive pressure,"" said Paul Sankey, analyst at Sankey Research in New York. ""The banks have a choice of multiple sectors to finance and it's a lot easier for them to not finance oil, gas and coal."" The assets are located in the Delaware Basin, the westernmost shale field within the Permian. The location deters Pioneer Natural Resources, which is focused in the Midland region, located further east. Some producers that could qualify for financing might avoid it, said Rystad's Abramov. Mewbourne Oil, the largest private producer in the Delaware, where Shell operates, has decades of good inventory in its existing acreage, making an acquisition unnecessary. The company did not respond to a comment request. Occidental operates in partnership with Shell and is a logical fit for the property, but is still shoring up its balance sheet following its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, said Alex Beeker, principal corporate analyst at Wood MacKenzie. Occidental declined to comment. --ReutersCopyright 2021 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (Syndigate.info)."

When Cimarex Energy and Cabot Oil & Gas recently unveiled their plan to merge in an all-stock deal, one of the selling points was the dividend.
But it's not expected to be a traditional payout.
Instead, the combined entity will aim to offer ""a sustainable base dividend that is positioned to grow over time and a variable dividend and a special dividend,"" Cimarex Energy CEO Thomas E. Jorden told analysts late last month.
Variable dividends, more common in Europe, are still rare in the U.S. But the concept, at least, has gained some traction, helped by a slew of dividend cuts and suspensions across the oil patch and other sectors, owing to the pandemic's onset last year.
A handful of energy companies have switched to this model, which typically uses a fixed base dividend and, depending on cash flow, a variable one as well. An important idea behind it is to give companies more flexibility with their payouts, especially in tougher parts of the economic and business cycle.
Income Investing
Besides the plans outlined by Cimarex Energy (ticker: XEC) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), base/variable dividend adopters include Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN).
""The leaders in the industry who get it understand what shareholders are really looking for,"" says Mike Liss, a co-manager at the American Century Equity Income Fund (TWEIX), adding that the ""opportunity is there to return cash to shareholders.""
Liss expects that ""more companies will continue to move in that direction because they've been rewarded by the market.""
The market has certainly rewarded Devon Energy, an exploration-and-production company based in Oklahoma City. Its shares have returned nearly 100% in 2021, dividends included. Devon recently declared a quarterly disbursement of 34 cents a share, up 13% from 30 cents. That consists of a fixed payout of 11 cents a share and a variable one of 23 cents.
""They are able to return a lot of cash to shareholders right now at what is becoming a really good point in the cycle for them,"" says Jim Covello, co-head of single-name research at Goldman Sachs and a proponent of variable dividends. ""But they are doing it in a way that's not going to constrain their balance sheet and cash flow in a less robust part of the cycle.""
Brent crude was recently around $71 a barrel, up from the high $30s last fall, according to FactSet.
Meanwhile, Pioneer Natural Resources has risen about 47% this year, versus around 44% for the energy stocks in the S&P 500. Cimarex has returned about 90%. Yet not all of these stocks have been outperformers, as shares of Cabot Oil & Gas have gained only 6%, including dividends.
Why haven't more companies—and other sectors—switched to a variable dividend policy?
""We've had a lot of calls with companies in other sectors,"" says Covello. ""But energy is definitely where you've seen it implemented.""
Yet he expects the concept to catch on in more sectors. ""Once a couple of companies start to do it and get rewarded for it, it's something you're going to see more widely adopted,"" he says.
Another selling point for variable dividend payers, Covello says, will be ""if those same companies outperform in a downturn."" Under such a scenario, he adds, their balance sheets would come under less pressure, owing to a payout that ""naturally comes down.""
Until those variables play out, however, variable dividends aren't likely to emerge en masse.

Pioneer Natural Resources, one the US's biggest independent oil operators, is to buy rival Texan producer Double-Point Energy in a $6.4bn cash and stock deal, as consolidation in the country's battered shale patch rolls on.
Pioneer said yesterday the acquisition would give it ""unmatched"" scale in Texas's Permian Basin, the world's most prolific oil-producing region.
Private equity-backed DoublePoint, which hosted Donald Trump during a presidential visit to Texas last July, was one of the Permian producers to increase production through last year's price crash, which briefly left US oil prices trading below zero. Pioneer said that, despite its fast-expanding footprint in the Permian, it would stick with its own plan for modest output growth.
""Pioneer will incorporate these assets into our investment model, migrating the assets from significant production growth to a free cash flow model, moderating growth for the US shale industry and generating significant value for our shareholders,"" said Scott Sheffield, Pioneer's chief executive. In January, Pioneer completed a deal for Parsley Energy, another large Permian producer, in a $7.6bn acquisition that led to Sheffield's company merging with one founded by his son, Bryan Sheffield.
Last year's oil price crash triggered scores of bankruptcies across the shale patch, a sharp fall in production and a wave of mergers and acquisitions. More than $50bn worth of deals were struck in the second half of 2020, according to data provider Enverus.
DoublePoint, backed by private equity groups Quantum Energy Partners and Apollo Global Management, was among the non-listed Permian producers able to increase production. Pioneer, which produced 370,000 barrels a day of oil and gas in 2020, said DoublePoint's production would reach 100,000 b/d by the end of June.
Pioneer's offer comprised 27m in shares, $1bn in cash and the assumption of $900m in debt. Cost savings from the deal would be $1bn over 10 years.
Pioneer said the deal would allow for an increase in the variable dividend paid to shareholders from 2022.

The Small-Cap Rally Is Just Getting Started

The are only a couple of criteria for our list. The stocks have to be down. They also have to be generating free cash flow and have below average debt. No one, including Barron's, wants to buy
value traps
—stocks that are cheap and stay cheap for a reason, such as weak demand or too much debt.
Keeping it simple yields a big advantage. We aren't thinking about the
election
or
Covid-19
or complicated stock factors to generate our list.
The New Dirty Dozen
The newest list has some familiar names that are still beaten up, along with some new companies. Energy stocks are still represented by ConocoPhillips (ticker: COP) and EOG Resources (EOG). A health-care and two defense stocks are repeats, as well: Biogen (BIIB), Huntington Ingalls (HII) and Curtiss-Wright (CW). Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) appears for the second time, too.
The new members of the dozen include Ford Motor (F), Acuity Brands (AYI), Armstrong Worldwide Industries (AWI), Omnicom (OMC), Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Intel (INTC).
Ford's shares are down for the year even as the situation the
car business is improving
. Intel is a microchip giant fallen on hard times. Acuity and Armstrong have been hit by the downturn in commercial construction as more people work from home. Aerojet makes rockets and Omnicom is an advertising giant.
The new names are down about 23% year to date on average. The entire dozen stocks are down about 30%.
This screen, or any screen, doesn't substitute for a full investment thesis. Investors, of course, can choose to buy, and can make money on, a regimented list of stocks with similar characteristics again and again. if they do that, however, they should pay close attention to whether the strategy is working. Styles and stocks go in and out of favor.

Growth stocks
, for instance, have beaten value stocks for a long time. Our dirty dozen is a value list, with stocks trading at either a low
price-to-asset ratio
or a low price-to-earnings ratio.
Looking Back
The strategy of buying beaten-up stocks with decent balance sheets has worked fairly well in 2020.
In April, the dirty dozen included Pentair (ticker: PNR), Steel Dynamics (STLD), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), Curtiss-Wright, Aptiv (APTV), Lear (LEA), Ralph Lauren (RL), General Motors (GM), Southwest Airlines (LUV), Expedia (EXPE), Valero Energy (VLO), Devon Energy (DVN) and Pioneer Natural Resources.
That dozen is up almost 50% since April, better than the 26% and 23% respective returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average over the same span. Pioneer is the only one of the 12 that fell, down less than 0.1% since the article was published.
In July, the second dozen included Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Medtronic (MDT), Universal Health Services (UHS), L3Harris Technologies (LHX), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Elanco Animal Health (ELAN), Biogen, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Hershey (HSY), Baxter (BAX), Cboe Global Markets, and Mercury Systems (MRCY).
That dozen hasn't outperformed. The average change is a roughly 6% gain, compared with 11% and 9% returns of the S&P and Dow. Six stocks are up and six are down.
Performance from the September group has been a little better. The third dirty dozen included ConocoPhillips, Pioneer Natural Resources, EOG Resources, Chevron (CVX), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), FLIR Systems (FLIR), Hexcel (HXL), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Euronet Worldwide (EEFT), Jabil (JBL), CDW (CDW) and Citigroup (C).
That group is up almost 9% over the past couple of months, better than the 4% returns of the S&P and Dow. Nine of the 12 stocks are up. Two of the three stocks that fell are the energy names—Pioneer and Conoco. It has been a tough year for oil and gas. The energy components of the S&P 500 are down about 45% year to date, and that is after those stocks rallied 14.2% on Monday.

The oil industry feels like it did in the late 1990s. That's a good thing, says Goldman Sachs analyst Michele Della Vigna. Oil prices bounced around in the '90s, falling below $10 a barrel in 1998. But oil stocks performed well, largely through consolidation. Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999 to form Exxon Mobil, and the shares rose 10%.
This decade has been miserable for oil and gas stocks, which are trailing the market despite leading a U.S. energy renaissance. Domestic output has more than doubled since 2010. That will have to reverse for a rebound, Della Vigna argues. The industry lost nearly a quarter of its workforce in the 1990s, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In recent weeks, four North American oil-and-gas deals have been announced, mostly involving shale companies: Cenovus Energy buying Husky Energy; Pioneer Natural Resources acquiring Parsley Energy; Devon Energy merging with WPX Energy; and ConocoPhillips buying Concho Resources. This will likely result in fewer workers, too.
As they join forces, industry members should start making better investment decisions, he adds: ""The oil-and-gas industry has transformed over the past few years, in terms of long-cycle developments, into the most consolidated market structure we have seen in 20 years.""
Investors and lenders have grown pickier about funding energy projects. But fewer of these, Della Vigna writes, should mean better economics for those moving forward. Capital expenditures per barrel peaked at $300 in 2016, he notes, and are now below $150. As production slows, prices will rise. Goldman has one of Wall Street's highest oil price targets: an average $59 next year, versus $40 today.

In a White House race defined by the pandemic, the future of the US energy industry made a rare intrusion at the final presidential debate.
Joe Biden's suggestion that he would ""transition away from the oil industry"" was seized on by Donald Trump, who warned that massive job losses would follow.
But for the US shale industry, whose pioneering technology and recordbreaking production have upended the oil market in the past decade, job cuts are nothing new. With many operators stretched even before virus crippled demand, bankruptcies are mounting and the jobs picture is deteriorating.
Hopes that the prized US shale patch, one that stretches from Texas to Pennsylvania and up to North Dakota, would propel the US to energy independence appear increasingly forlorn. After years of stunning growth, domestic oil output is likely to fall this year by the biggest annual margin on record.
""Christmas 2019 will forever be seen as the good old days of the US oil and gas industry,"" said Adam Waterous, head of Waterous Energy Fund, a private equity firm that is eschewing shale investments in favour of oil assets in Canada. If gloom has descended on a sector confronting a less dazzling future, a consensus is emerging on its priorities. According to Daniel Yergin, vice-chairman of consultancy IHS Markit, repairing relations with investors tops the list. The sector burned through $400bn of outside capital between 2008 and 2018, according to consultancy Rystad Energy, while barely managing to turn a profit. Even for the best operators, the cost of capital is rising, a reflection of shale's poor returns and an investor base beginning to turn its attention to renewable energy.
""Even before Covid, shale needed a second revolution,"" said Mr Yergin, author of a book on energy, The New Map. ""It needed a revolution in terms of its relationship with its investors.""
Some investors hope that if oil prices remain around $40 a barrel, a wave of consolidation will deliver a far more efficient industry and one more enticing to Wall Street.
The momentum behind M&A is building. In the past month, Devon Energy has bought WPX Energy, ConocoPhillips has pounced on Concho Resources, and Pioneer Natural Resources has announced its plan to buy Parsley Energy.
The bulls also look back to the shale patch's recovery in 2016, when it emerged from a price crash leaner and fitter, able to increase production rapidly at much lower prices.
Muqsit Ashraf, head of Accenture's energy practice, pointed to factors that had gained in importance since the industry grappled with the last swoon in oil prices. Digitalisation allowed for better well design, placement of well bores and understanding of the subsurface, which could all yield 20 to 40 per cent efficiency gains.
But operators said repeating the simple changes like round-the-clock fracking that drove break-even prices down during the last crash was not an option.
""There's only 24 hours a day,"" Matt Gallagher, chief executive of Parsley Energy, said this summer. ""It will be single-digit cost reduction percentages from here.""
With squeezing costs and driving efficiencies harder than it was, it is little surprise that the consolidation of the past month has centred on the premium acreage of the Permian Basin, the prolific field in west Texas and south-eastern New Mexico. It is an acknowledgment that only the best oil-bearing shale rock will offer profits in a world of lower oil prices.
Companies were focused on the ""core of the core"", said Mr Ashraf — the very best acreage, where crude could be produced cheaply. Parts of the Permian, he said, could break even in the low $20s or $30s a barrel.
That was beyond much of the industry, said Mr Waterous, who argued that ""you need a price north of $70 before you start achieving a cost of capital"".
There is little doubt that the executives driving the past month's dealmaking have one eye on Wall Street.
Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, said that in an industry littered with dozens of independent operators, only four companies were ""investable"": his own, plus EOG Resources, ConocoPhillips and Hess.
""Most companies are below a $10bn market cap. And so most investors are not going to look at the small companies to invest in.""
Occidental Petroleum, which last year borrowed more than $50bn to buy Anadarko in a deal decried as among the worst bets in a shale patch that has not been short of them, did not make his list.
Few believe consolidation can stop here. But more bankruptcies might precede it, said Chris Duncan, a director at Brandes Investment Partners, an advisory firm.
Thanks to a borrowing binge during the boom and the more recent crash in the sector's valuation, more than half of operators carried debts equal to or greater than their market capitalisation, said Mr Duncan.
Rystad Energy estimated that North American oil and gas sector debt this year had hit an all-time high and could reach $100bn before the year is out, far more than in 2016, after the last price crash. As many as 55 E&P companies would go bust this year, it projected.
That is a prospect that will deepen the sector's pain, as unsecured debts are left to reverberate down a list of creditors that includes service providers and midstream companies.
Mr Duncan said: ""I don't think it's a matter of if more consolidation happens. It's just how it happens and how fast.""
For Mr Ashraf, one consequence of the consolidation will be that the top 10 oil producers will provide as much as half the shale industry's total capex in the next five years, up from less than 30 per cent during the past decade.
The big beasts, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, will impose economies of scale concentrated on the Permian.
If the industry's future is smaller and concentrated in fewer hands, most believe the halcyon days of giddy growth in production are also behind it. US oil output more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, hitting a record near 13m b/d before the pandemic struck.
Mr Sheffield puts US oil production growth at 2 per cent a year over the next decade.
Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the collapse in capital investment could leave production next year 4m barrels a day below its recent historic peak.
""Shale shook the world's oil market not just because the total volume was so large but because the annual growth rate was so rapid,"" said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. ""But those days are over.""The big beasts, including Chevron and Exxon, will impose economies of scale focused on the PermianUS oil output is forecast to keep falling Crude production (million barrels per day) Sources: Energy Information Administration; Haynes and Boone LLP; Baker Hughes Number of rigs (oil and gas) The US rig count went into freefall as drilling activity collapsed 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 2001 05 10 15 20 Forecast 0 10 20 30 40 50 Jan Sep * Figures include US and Canada Bankruptcy numbers have accelerated Chapter 11 filings* (cumulative) 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 2020 2018 19 20 Exploration & production Oilfield services

""Most companies are below a $10bn market cap. And so most investors are not going to look at the small companies to invest in.""
Occidental Petroleum, which last year borrowed more than $50bn to buy Anadarko in a deal decried as among the worst bets in a shale patch that has not been short of them, did not make his list.
Few believe consolidation can stop here. But more bankruptcies might precede it, said Chris Duncan, a director at Brandes Investment Partners, an advisory firm.
Thanks to a borrowing binge during the boom and the more recent crash in the sector's valuation, more than half of operators carried debts equal to or greater than their market capitalisation, said Mr Duncan.
Rystad Energy estimated that North American oil and gas sector debt this year had hit an all-time high and could reach $100bn before the year is out, far more than in 2016, after the last price crash. As many as 55 E&P companies would go bust this year, it projected.
That is a prospect that will deepen the sector's pain, as unsecured debts are left to reverberate down a list of creditors that includes service providers and midstream companies.
Mr Duncan said: ""I don't think it's a matter of if more consolidation happens. It's just how it happens and how fast.""
For Mr Ashraf, one consequence of the consolidation will be that the top 10 oil producers will provide as much as half the shale industry's total capex in the next five years, up from less than 30 per cent during the past decade.
The big beasts, including Chevron and ExxonMobil, will impose economies of scale concentrated on the Permian.
If the industry's future is smaller and concentrated in fewer hands, most believe the halcyon days of giddy growth in production are also behind it. US oil output more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, hitting a record near 13m b/d before the pandemic struck.
Mr Sheffield puts US oil production growth at 2 per cent a year over the next decade.
Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips, said the collapse in capital investment could leave production next year 4m barrels a day below its recent historic peak.
""Shale shook the world's oil market not just because the total volume was so large but because the annual growth rate was so rapid,"" said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. ""But those days are over.""The big beasts, including Chevron and Exxon, will impose economies of scale focused on the Permian

Pioneer Natural Resources is in talks to buy rival Parsley Energy, according to people briefed about the matter, in the latest sign that consolidation in the US shale industry is gaining pace.
The two oil and gas producers — both exclusively focused on the Permian Basin, the world's most prolific oilfield — are negotiating an all-stock deal that would help them better weather the headwinds faced by producers due to low prices of crude.
A deal, which would create a significant Permian player with about $10bn in revenues and production of more than 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, could be reached within weeks, people close to the talks said.
A tie-up between the two producers would mark the fourth big deal on the US oil patch since this year's price crash sent the market into freefall and left companies scrambling to cut costs.
ConocoPhillips on Monday announced it had agreed to buy rival Concho in a deal valued at $13.3bn including debt. Chevron agreed to buy Noble Energy in July in a $13bn transaction, while Devon Energy last month agreed to take over rival WPX for $12bn.
The Saudi-Russia price war earlier this year and a collapse in demand due to global lockdowns wreaked havoc on the market, sending the US benchmark West Texas Intermediate tumbling below zero in April for the first time.
Prices have since bounced back, but at around $40 a barrel they remain down by a third since the beginning of the year. That has forced producers to dial back activity and make deep spending cuts as they fight to survive the worst oil price crisis in decades. The North American rig count — a key measure of drilling activity — has dropped more than 60 per cent compared to last year.
But companies have begun to take advantage of the crash, which has sent valuations plummeting to multiyear lows, in order to build up scale in the US shale sector.
The two companies are already well connected. Parsley was set up by Bryan Sheffield, the son of Pioneer chief executive Scott Sheffield, in 2008. Matt Gallagher, the current head of Parsley, also spent five years working at Pioneer.
Valued at about $14bn with daily production of 375,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter, Pioneer is significantly larger than Parsley, which produced 183,000 barrels and whose market capitalisation has tumbled from a peak of more than $9bn in mid-2018 to about $3.8bn.
Last week Saudi Arabia and Russia urged other oil producer countries to stick to supply cuts agreed in April, given growing concerns about the limited capacity in markets to absorb extra supply and fears the pandemic could inflict lasting damage on the industry.
The potential merger between Pioneer and Parsley was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
Neither Pioneer nor Parsley responded to requests for comment.A deal would help both weather the headwinds faced by producers due to low prices of crude

| Jump to first hitConsolidation in the U.S. shale industry is accelerating, ratcheting up pressure on oil and gas producers to gobble up smaller rivals, analysts and executives said.
Pioneer Natural Resources Co., one of the largest independent shale operators, joined the ranks of dealmakers as it announced on Tuesday a low-premium US$4.5-billion buyout of Parsley Energy Inc.
The coronavirus pandemic has slashed oil demand and forced struggling shale producers to cut costs as they cope with a suboptimal US$40-per-barrel crude price, an uncertain outlook, and the need to invest to keep production flat due to the swift rate at which shale well output declines. Global majors are not likely to step in, so analysts expect the dwindling universe of notable producers to seek out deal partners.
""The universe of companies with which you can combine is shrinking by the day,"" said Matthew Portillo, managing director at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
On Monday, Concho Resources Inc. agreed to sell to ConocoPhillips for US$9.7 billion. That followed Chevron Corp.'s US$4.2-billion purchase of Noble Energy this month, and Devon Energy Corp.'s US$2.6-billion all-stock, low premium buy of rival WPX Energy Inc. in September. European majors are avoiding new oil and gas purchases and Exxon Mobil Corp. is cutting costs, making them unlikely candidates for a deal.
""Those without very strong balance sheets are trying to survive,"" Concho Resources chief executive Tim Leach said in an interview on Monday, when the Conoco deal was announced.
Leach said companies with stronger balance sheets will buy weaker firms.
Investors are increasingly looking for companies with market values of at least US$5 billion, preferably those that pay dividends. While most of the larger shale firms pay dividends, a Refinitiv Eikon index of U.S. oil-and-gas producers has lost 55 per cent this year, compared with the S&P 500's 7.4 per cent rise.
""The outlook for the smaller companies in the sector has diminished,"" Portillo said.
Buyers could include Marathon Oil Corp., Apache Corp. and EOG Resources Inc., while Cimarex Energy Co., PDC Energy Inc. and Parsley are top consolidation candidates, Portillo said.
Financial buyers could emerge as buyers, as many companies carry heavy levels of debt.
""It's going to take the banks to take over on companies and consolidate them into bigger companies,"" said one shale executive, who did not think many companies had strong enough balance sheets to acquire rivals.
Bankruptcies are up 21 per cent so far this year among energy producers, according to law firm Haynes and Boone.
Even combined companies would ""still have to walk the tightrope"" between trying to return capital to shareholders and spending to keep high-decline shale fields pumping, said Andrew Dittmar, M&A analyst at Enverus.
Shale output rebounded during the summer after the initial pandemic-induced lockdowns, but companies are investing less now. Shale production is expected to fall by 123,000 barrels per day in November, the largest drop since May, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.
Deals must add to cash flow, not add too much debt and have small premiums, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. ""Any deal that requires significant cost savings or a higher oil price to justify the price paid will not be well-received,"" she said."

Pioneer Natural Resources Co. has agreed to buy Parsley Energy Inc. for $4.5 billion, the latest in a flurry of U.S. oil tie-ups as companies seek to weather low prices brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
The all-stock deal values Parsley at a 7.9% premium to its closing value Monday and would solidify Pioneer's place as one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top American oil field.
The string of transactions is expected to continue for healthier companies in America's most prolific oil fields, investors said. But many smaller, debt-burdened-companies that are hoping for a deal may be left with few offers.
Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said that size and scale would be key to surviving as an independent oil-and-gas producer as the world transitions away from fossil fuels. ""There's really going to be three or four players left in the U.S. independent sector,"" he said.
The deal comes a day after ConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion. Last month, Devon Energy Corp. agreed to a $2.6 billion merger with WPX Energy Inc., while Chevron Corp. in July agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion. All of them all-stock deals with premiums of 15% or below. The targets are among a relatively small group of U.S. oil-and-gas companies considered financially healthy enough to attract buyers, investors said.
Pioneer expects the combined company to realize $325 million in savings annually by reducing administrative expenses and other costs. The deal, which is expected to close early next year, is subject to approval from the shareholders of both companies.

Pioneer Natural Resources
agreed to buy
Parsley Energy after the market closed on Tuesday, the latest in a flurry of oil acquisitions.
Pioneer (ticker: PXD), a $14 billion company, will buy Parsley (PE) in an all-stock transaction, valuing Parsley's equity at $4.5 billion. That is a slight bump from Parsley's $4.2 billion market cap as of Monday's close. Adding in debt, it is a $7.6 billion transaction.
One analyst considered the 7.9% premium to Monday's close relatively small. ""I thought it would be moderate but this was even a bit less than I was thinking,"" Truist analyst Neal Dingmann said in an email. In general, oil companies have been agreeing to relatively small premiums this year, probably because the outlook for oil prices is subdued for the next several months.

that the two companies were talking
, without saying what price they were considering. Once the price was disclosed after the market closed, Parsley shares fell 3%. Pioneer was down 0.3% in after-hours trading after falling 4% during regular trading hours. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%.
Both companies have significant holdings in the Permian Basin, a productive oil region in Texas and New Mexico. In a release announcing the deal, they emphasized that the combination would allow them to reduce their combined costs by $325 million a year. And they may be able to recover oil more cheaply in the future. Shale-production can often be done more efficiently on larger parcels of land for technical reasons.
""With neighboring acreage positions located entirely in the low-cost, high-margin Permian Basin, the industrial logic of this transaction is sound,"" Parsley CEO Matt Gallagher said in a statement.
The two companies are connected by more than their Perman acreage, however. Parsley founder and Chairman Bryan Sheffield is Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield's son. That family connection might necessitate more board scrutiny, J.P. Morgan analyst Arun Jayaram wrote before the deal was announced.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co. has agreed to buy Parsley Energy Inc. for $4.5 billion, the latest in a flurry of U.S. oil tie-ups as companies seek to weather low prices brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
The all-stock deal, which values Parsley at a 7.9% premium to its closing value Monday, would solidify Pioneer's place as one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the top American oil field.
The long-anticipated string of transactions is expected to continue for healthier companies in the country's most prolific oil fields, investors said, while many smaller, debt-burdened companies that are hoping for a deal may draw few offers.
Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said in an interview Tuesday that size and scale would be key to surviving as an independent oil-and-gas producer as the world moves away from fossil fuels, and would help his company return more cash to shareholders. But he said additional combinations of industry players may take time.
""I do not see much more coming until these other companies can deliver with excess cash flow over the next two or three years,"" he said.
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Pioneer and Parsley were in talks to combine . Shares in Parsley increased about 5% on Tuesday, as Pioneer's stock fell around 4%.
""The combination of Parsley and Pioneer creates an organization set to thrive as we forge a strong new link at the low end of the global cost curve,"" Parsley Chief Executive Matt Gallagher said in a statement. He is poised to join the combined company's board of directors
 The deal comes a day after ConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for $9.7 billion. Last month, Devon Energy Corp. agreed to a $2.6 billion merger with WPX Energy Inc., while Chevron Corp. in July agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion. All of them were all-stock deals with premiums of 15% or below.
The targets are among a relatively small group of U.S. oil-and-gas companies considered healthy enough financially to attract buyers, investors said.
Only about a quarter of major U.S. shale operators were attractive acquisition or merger targets based on their financial and operational strength, the Deloitte consulting firm said in a recent report. Less-attractive possibilities made up about half of the sector and a significant portion of U.S. oil and gas production. Deloitte deemed the rest as either risky investments or attractive largely to private-equity firms.
In addition to having poor returns, many companies accumulated steep debts during the fracking boom, while only a few have managed to operate with lower costs that allow for better returns when oil prices recover, said Ben Cook, portfolio manager at BP Capital Fund Advisors.
Though the industry is in a consolidation phase that will likely extend beyond the Permian Basin into other parts of Texas as well as North Dakota, Mr. Cook said, ""I don't think [M&A] happens for everyone.""
All told, U.S. shale drillers have generated net negative free cash flows of about $300 billion since 2010, Deloitte said. Since 2015, at least 248 North American oil and gas producers have filed for bankruptcy, according to Dallas law firm Haynes & Boone. The industry's bankruptcy cases have involved more than $175 billion in debt, the firm said in a recent report.
This year, operators including Chesapeake Energy Corp., Whiting Petroleum Corp. and California Resources Corp. filed for bankruptcy as the coronavirus pandemic crushed energy demand.
There is no market for about 80% of the roughly 500 oil and gas producers in North America, according to Adam Waterous, the founder of Waterous Energy Fund, a private-equity firm. Mr. Waterous said many companies bought up unproven assets during the boom, most of which have proven to be unprofitable without high oil prices.
""It's not as simple as smashing together some private equity [oil and gas] companies that have no buyer,"" said Mr. Waterous, who was previously the head of investment banking and energy at Bank of Nova Scotia. ""The vast majority of these are not good assets.""
Still, absent a jump in prices to $50 or $60 per barrel, deals in the oil patch should continue to flow, said Ben Dell, managing partner at private investment firm Kimmeridge Energy Management Co. U.S. benchmark oil settled around $41 a barrel Tuesday.
""There's a palpable feeling of being left behind now and that the business model has changed, and that's resonating with management teams,"" Mr. Dell said.
Mr. Sheffield, Pioneer's chief, is the father of Parsley's executive chairman, Bryan Sheffield. Pioneer Chairman J. Kenneth Thompson said in an interview that neither Scott Sheffield nor Bryan Sheffield was allowed to participate in deal negotiations.
Scott Sheffield said he was also barred from discussing the acquisition with executives.
Pioneer said it expects the combined company to realize roughly $325 million in savings annually by reducing administrative expenses and other costs.
The deal, which is expected to close early next year, is subject to approval from the shareholders of both companies. The companies said that Quantum Energy Partners, Parsley's largest shareholder, with a 17% stake, backs the combination.

Two more U.S. oil and gas producers are reportedly considering joining up, another sign that
the recent trend of mergers and acquisitions is real and persistent
.
Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin,
is in talks to buy
Parsley Energy (PE), a smaller company with several historic ties to Pioneer, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Pioneer CEO Scott Sheffield is the father of Parsley Chairman Bryan Sheffield, and current Parsley CEO Matt Gallagher used to work at Pioneer.
The two companies are reportedly discussing an all-stock transaction, which has been the trend with several recent deals. The price isn't clear, though analysts have speculated it could be at a small or medium-size premium, potentially up to 25%. Neither company responded to requests for comment.
Pioneer stock fell 5% and Parsley was up 0.4% on Tuesday morning.
Like other oil-and-gas companies, Pioneer and Parsley are facing a prolonged period of low oil prices, because the world is using less jet fuel and other products as people hunker down and try to avoid Covid-19. Few companies can thrive when oil prices are at $40 a barrel, and it makes it particularly hard when several companies are competing aggressively for market share.
That's why consolidation makes sense now and could finally bring the market back into balance after
a decade of underperformance for oil stocks
. Investors have shunned the industry, and energy recently made up less than 3% of the S&P 500 after accounting for more than 10% in 2008.
But consolidation could radically change the industry if it leads to a few more-rational players.
""What emerges after the consolidation? Less players, better managements, better capital discipline,"" wrote analyst Paul Sankey of Sankey Research. ""The set up is terrific. We remain very concerned about the next year oil balance, as does OPEC+, with continued excess inventory and spare production capacity. However, the main problem in global oil markets has been excess U.S. supply at sub-economic returns. The consolidation of the US E&P industry, through mergers and bankruptcies, is underlining the cyclical nature of oil. Low prices will cure low prices. When demand returns, so will excess returns.""
The growing U.S. government deficit also sets up well for oil, Sankey argues. It could lead to inflation, which would put pressure on the value of the dollar. A cheap dollar historically has helped oil prices.
Although there have been deals overseas, the latest wave of consolidation is mostly centered in the U.S. Chevron (CVX) bought Noble Energy, Devon Energy (DVN) plans to merge with WPX Energy (WPX), and ConocoPhillips (COP)
announced on Monday
that it had agreed to buy Concho Resources (CXO) for $9.7 billion.
Oil companies seem particularly focused on expanding their drilling in the Permian Basin, which is in Texas and New Mexico. Parsley and Pioneer already drill there and their acreage is contiguous in some places. Shale-drilling technology has made it cost-efficient to drill on large parcels so combining acreage can help returns.
Truist analyst Neal Dingmann thinks a few other companies are in a good position to be on the buying or selling side of a deal. And as companies pair off, there could be an accelerating case of FOMO—fear of missing out. Eventually all the good dance partners find other suitors.
Dingmann projects that this deal ""could drive additional potential takeouts such as ""Cimarex Energy (XEC), Whiting Petroleum (WLL), EOG Resources (EOG), Matador Resources (MTDR), QEP Resources (QEP), Penn Virginia (PVAC),"" and more.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co. is in talks to buy Parsley Energy Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, as a wave of consolidation takes hold in the beleaguered oil patch.
The two oil-and-gas companies, shale producers that operate in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, are discussing an all-stock deal that could be completed by the end of the month assuming the talks don't fall apart, the people said.
Austin, Texas-based Parsley has a market value of about $4 billion. It also has more than $3 billion of debt.
The combination would be the latest in a series of tie-ups among energy producers seeking to scale up amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has eroded oil demand. That has caused a historic collapse in U.S. benchmark oil prices, which briefly plunged below zero in April and have since rebounded to around $41 a barrel.
A deal would follow close on the heels of ConocoPhillips's $9.7 billion agreement Monday to buy Concho Resources Inc. Devon Energy Corp. agreed last month to a $2.6 billion merger with WPX Energy Inc., while Chevron Corp. agreed in July to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion .
Buying Parsley would give Pioneer additional acreage in the Permian, solidifying the company's place as one of the largest oil producers in America's top oil field.
Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield is the father of Parsley's co-founder and chairman, Bryan Sheffield. Based in Irving, Texas, Pioneer has a market value of roughly $15 billion after its shares dropped by nearly two-thirds from a high in mid-2014.
The elder Sheffield previously ran Pioneer from 1997 to 2016. He returned to the company in 2019 after Pioneer strained to meet production goals and its costs soared under his successor. The company recently said Chief Financial Officer Richard Dealy would become president and chief operating officer early next year, likely setting him up to eventually take over.
Parsley was founded by Bryan Sheffield along with Mike Hinson and Paul Treadwell in 2008, and named for Mr. Sheffield's late maternal grandfather, Joe Parsley, whose hundreds of small-but-steady West Texas wells gave rise to a dynasty.
Parsley's current CEO, Matt Gallagher, came over a decade ago from Pioneer. Mr. Gallagher, who is in his late 30s, is one of the youngest chief executives in the oil patch and earlier this year joined Pioneer in calling for Texas regulators to limit oil output in the state for the first time in decades. Like rivals, Parsley has been working to reduce drilling and spending to keep costs low.
Parsley is set to report third-quarter earnings Oct. 28, while Pioneer is set to report Nov. 4.

Oil companies are reporting their worst earnings results in years, but their stocks are on the rise. In fact, the energy sector is up 4% on the week, better than any other sector in the market.
It is a sign that investors have moved on from the disastrous second quarter and are starting to pick winners for the future. Among the companies winning strong reviews for their earnings reports are shale-oil drillers Devon Energy (ticker: DVN), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG).
They aren't the only ones getting the benefit of the doubt. Major European oil companies have also been up over the past two days following BP's (BP) announcement on Tuesday
that it will cut its dividend in half
, a decision that was less drastic than some analysts had expected.
It helps that the price of oil has been rising. On Wednesday, crude futures jumped. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 3.8% to $46.11. as West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose by 3.9% to $43.34.
Oil inventories fell over the past week,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration said
on Wednesday. Oil prices also rose on Tuesday
after an explosion in Beirut
. There were initial fears that the blast was caused by an attack, though more evidence now indicates it was an accident.
For some U.S. producers, it has also helped that they are returning cash to shareholders, or committing to return it in the years ahead. Devon Energy was up 9.3% near midday Wednesday after announcing a $100 million special dividend—26 cents per share—connected to the earlier-than-expected sale of its holdings in the Barnett shale play in Texas. Devon also impressed Wall Street by producing more oil than expected despite drastic cuts in capital spending. And its projections for the rest of the year indicate that trend will continue.
Devon reduced its capital-spending guidance while increasing its production guidance, Raymond James analyst John Freeman noted. And Devon is reducing debt. ""Notably, Devon plans to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in outstanding debt which should result in a $75 million reduction in annual interest expense,"" he wrote.
Pioneer Natural Resources also was rising on Wednesday after posting better-than-expected production and in-line earnings. Shares were up 2.4%. Its production beat expectations by 7% even as its capital expenses came in 11% below expectations.
In addition, Pioneer plans to return more cash to shareholders.
""Pioneer announced a long-term plan targeting 10%+ shareholder total return,"" Freeman wrote. ""The plan involves cash flow reinvestment of 70-80% that will deliver 5% plus oil growth and the remaining cash flow delivered to shareholders through the combination of a growing base dividend and variable dividend.""
Diamondback Energy also
showed it can be more efficient
, reporting ""impressive reductions in well costs and cash operating costs, both of which we believe may represent the lowest in the Permian,"" according to Truist analyst Neal Dingmann. ""Get ready for months and months of free cash flow,"" he wrote. Diamondback shares were up 3.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2%.

Convertible-bond issuance is running at a record pace as companies like Lyft (ticker: LYFT), Zillow Group (Z), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN), and Penn National Gaming (PENN) seek to shore up their balance sheets or simply take advantage of strong investor demand for the hybrid securities.
U.S. convertible issuance in April totaled $14 billion, the strongest month for issuance since 2008. And so far in May, more than $10 billion of deals have been priced, according to Michael Youngworth, the head of global convertibles strategy at BofA Securities. U.S. issuance year to date has run at about $39 billion, well ahead of the pace last year, when issuance totaled $53 billion.
Youngworth says some of the issuance is ""rescue financing"" for companies hard hit by the economic downturn triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. ""The convertible structure is attractive for capital raising,"" he says.
Companies can get much lower yields on convertible debt than regular, or ""straight,"" bonds by offering investors an equity kicker, with the debt convertible into stock at an average premium of about 30% above the share price at the time of pricing. They can be converted at the investor's discretion.
For investors,
convertibles are appealing because they usually offer limited downside
given the debt structure, as well as a chance to realize hefty gains if the stock rallies. For many companies, convertibles are their only debt.
Youngworth adds that companies with highly volatile stocks can get relatively low yields in the convertible market. The models used by many professional convertible investors favor such stocks.
Lyft issued
$650 million of five-year convertible notes Tuesday
with a rate of just 1.5% and a conversion premium of 30%. Penn National Gaming, a regional casino company,
sold $300 million of 2.75% notes
due in 2026, also with a conversion premium of 30%.
Pioneer Natural Resources had
one of the largest deals recently
, a $1.15 billion five-year convertible with a rate of just 0.25% and a 30% premium. The low rate reflected the company's investment-grade bond ratings. The company's straight debt yields about 3%.
Carnival (CCL), the leading cruise line operator, which has been hard hit by Covid-19, offered $2 billion of 5.75% convertible debt in early April, compared with an 11.5% rate on straight debt. The convertibles have appreciated 40% since then as the stock has rallied—demonstrating their appeal.
Most convertibles are sold to institutional investors under SEC Rule 144A, but some are registered and are available to retail investors, including Southwest Airlines' (LUV)
$2 billion of 1.25% convertibles issued in late April.

There are many other ways to invest in convertibles, including exchange-traded funds like SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Convertible Securities (CWB), closed-end funds, and open-end mutual funds.

Two leading shale producers in America's hottest oilfield are formally asking Texas regulators to consider curtailing crude output in the state as the industry grapples with collapsing demand and plunging prices.
Pioneer Natural Resources Co. and Parsley Energy Inc. sent a letter Monday requesting that the Railroad Commission of Texas hold a hearing on the idea of curbing crude production, something the state hasn't done since the 1970s. The two are among the largest producers in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
""We're already being prorated by pipelines, so we want fairness in the state of Texas,"" Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield said in an interview.
Matt Gallagher, Parsley's chief executive, warned that without additional regulation, many producers likely would have to shut down their wells soon.
""If we keep producing until we hit a wall, with no proactive decisions, we're going to see single-digit prices across the country,"" Mr. Gallagher said, adding that an aggressive response by U.S. drillers to curtail production could encourage rivals Saudi Arabia and Russia to do the same.
The Wall Street Journal first reported March 19 that
Texas regulators were considering
limiting production in response to producer requests. It isn't clear whether the three-member commission is likely to do so, however. Just one of the commissioners, Ryan Sitton, has publicly supported the idea.
Mr. Sitton tweeted Monday that the commission should hold a hearing on the matter as soon as possible. ""You either proactively manage or you simply reactively manage,"" he said in an interview.
A spokesman for Wayne Christian, the agency's chairman, said stabilizing the oil market is essential for the Texas economy and national security.
""Chairman Christian looks forward to continue discussing stabilization efforts, including tools like proration, to ensure we are doing everything we can to get Texans back to work,"" he said, adding that the state shouldn't act unilaterally.
Chevron Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp., two of the largest producers in the Permian, are opposed to any mandated cuts to oil production, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Sheffield said that several of the companies that buy Pioneer's oil called late Friday requesting that the company reduce output.
""The message was: Everybody needs to slow down and reduce their production. And everybody needs to stop completing wells,"" Mr. Sheffield said. ""That's primarily due to the fact that the refiners are cutting back their runs and they don't need any more product.""
He said he would recommend that the state curtail oil output by 20% until demand rebounds, though that might not be enough.
U.S. benchmark oil prices fell Monday to around $20 a barrel, their
lowest level
in nearly two decades.

Boone Pickens Jr. Dies; A pioneer in hostile takeovers, he made a name for himself with a string of unsolicited bids for larger oil companies",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/oilman-t-boone-pickens-jr-dies-pioneer-hostile/docview/2288103274/se-2?accountid=7064,PXD,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

T. Boone Pickens Jr., an oil prospector and pioneer in hostile takeovers whose folksy wit made him one of America's most recognizable business leaders, has died at age 91.
Mr. Pickens rose to fame as founder and chief executive of Mesa Petroleum Corp., where he was an advocate for shareholder rights who liked to vilify the excesses of ""Big Oil"". He later morphed into a high-stakes energy trader before becoming a philanthropist and early investor in renewable power.
His incisive business opinions and colorful turns of phrase made him a popular figure for decades. ""I'd rather be lucky than good,"" Mr. Pickens often remarked.
But his defining characteristic was a seemingly bottomless well of confidence—in his ventures, as well as in U.S. energy, whether it was oil, natural gas or, later in life, wind.
Mr. Pickens eventually accomplished a rare feat among business leaders: single-name celebrity. He was simply ""Boone.""
He died Wednesday of natural causes, surrounded by friends and family, according to spokesman Jay Rosser. He had endured a series of strokes in recent years and sustained head injuries in a 2017 fall.
In an annual letter last month to football fans of Oklahoma State University, where he was a major benefactor, Mr. Pickens reflected on his mortality. ""I'm realistic about being close to the finish line,"" he said. ""And I'm working diligently to complete projects as quickly as I can and tie up any loose ends.""
Born in Holdenville, Okla., as Thomas Pickens Jr., he was a trained geologist who went to work for Phillips Petroleum after graduating from college. Two years later, he struck out on his own,
forming what was later renamed Mesa
.
He was little known outside of energy circles until 1968, when he made the first of a string of unsolicited bids for much-larger oil companies. He later claimed the idea for a hostile takeover came to him in the shower, after a friendly overture was turned down. ""It has become cheaper to look for oil on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than in the ground,"" he said at the time.
In 1983, Mesa, which at the time was based in Amarillo, Texas, made a bid for Gulf Corp., one of the largest corporations in America and a titan in the oil world. While unsuccessful, the bid forced Gulf to accept a merger with Chevron Corp. A Pickens-led investment group earned $760 million when the shares it bought in Gulf appreciated during the takeover.
Though his targets regarded him as a financial pirate fueled by junk bonds, Mr. Pickens contended that executives leading companies in his crosshairs were poor managers and not looking out for the interests of their shareholders.
""Chief executives, who themselves own few shares of their companies, have no more feeling for the average stockholder than they do for baboons in Africa,"" Time magazine quoted him as saying in a 1985 cover profile.
Eventually, oil companies erected stronger takeover defenses to fend off Mr. Pickens and other activist investors.
Mesa Petroleum hit hard times when the price of natural gas collapsed. Fort Worth, Texas, billionaire Richard Rainwater and his wife, Darla Moore, who managed their investments, bought shares in Mesa. Eventually, Ms. Moore pushed Mr. Pickens out of the company he had run for 40 years in 1996—an ironic twist for the onetime corporate raider.
Mesa
eventually merged
with another independent energy producer to become Pioneer Natural Resources Co., now a major operator in West Texas' Permian Basin.
The year Mr. Pickens left Mesa, he launched BP Capital Energy Fund. While much of Wall Street was headed toward technical trading and using complex algorithms, Mr. Pickens focused on fundamental analysis of supply and demand for oil and natural gas.He later branched out from fossil fuels, making high-profile, although unsuccessful,
investments in water and wind
.
His order of 667 wind turbines from General Electric in 2008 was the largest single order ever at the time and was destined for a planned wind farm in the Texas panhandle. He pulled the plug on the $2 billion project a year later because of difficulty moving electricity from such a remote region to city centers and because falling natural gas prices made competing electric power sources inexpensive.
""Over a lifetime in business I've had to make a lot of tough calls—right and wrong, and many of them very public. Good calls have made me a lot of money, and I've lost my ass on the bad ones,"" Mr. Pickens later wrote online. ""Fortunately, I've been right more often than I've been wrong.""

When Mr. Pickens' book, ""The First Billion Is the Hardest,"" made its debut
, he told The Wall Street Journal: ""I can still reach a young audience who want to know that average intelligence and a good work ethic is all you need.""
His fans were legion. Young and old, liberal and conservative, many Americans embraced his Pickens Plan to break OPEC, wean the U.S. from foreign crude and drill for more cleaner burning natural gas across the U.S. to replace dirty coal in power plants.
Former Texas governor and current U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry praised Mr. Pickens on Wednesday as ""a Texas-sized legend who left a permanent impact on the world of American energy as we know it. He was a bold visionary who long championed a diverse energy mix from renewable power to oil and gas, and understood that American energy security is critical to our national security.""
Mr. Pickens, a graduate of Oklahoma State, donated $165 million to transform athletics at his alma mater, one of the largest gifts ever to a college sports program. His largess helped improve the fortunes of the Oklahoma State Cowboys football team, which upgraded its redbrick football stadium, now known as Boone Pickens Stadium, with luxury suites that raised its standing in the Big 12 Conference.

T. Boone Pickens Jr. Settles SEC Charge of Misleading Investors in 1988 Deal
(Sept. 28, 1990)
But the school athletics fund encountered financial difficulties after Mr. Pickens recommended it try to boost its returns by
taking out insurance policies
on the lives of Oklahoma State alumni, which backfired when the death payouts didn't cover the premiums. The plan was ultimately abandoned.
Some of his later energy bets were also not as prescient as his earlier ones. His ever-bullish outlook for oil trades led to
losses of $2 billion
during 2008's financial crisis, for example.
As fracking triggered a revolution in U.S. oil production, Mr. Pickens was initially skeptical that the techniques could produce enough to have an effect on global prices, a stance that proved folly.
Mr. Pickens spent his later years running his financial firm, BP Capital, from his office in a low-rise Dallas office complex. There, he hunkered down in a conference room with a small dog at his feet and his beloved bite-size Butterfinger candy bars always within reach in a glass bowl marked ""Boone's Butterfingers.""
His trading positions were projected onto one wall and on another hung maps of his huge range in the Texas Panhandle, showing the wells he had drilled there and those that were planned.
His Mesa Vista ranch was a source of immense pride for Mr. Pickens, who hosted heads of state, oil executives and other A-listers there. It sprawled over more than 100 square miles, had its own airport, art gallery, a chapel in which he once married and an 11,000 square-foot kennel for his pack of hunting dogs, which numbered more than three dozen. To be invited to Mesa Vista for a bird hunt was a rite of passage for aspiring energy tycoons. Mr. Pickens had an unflappable memory when it came to hunt companions who couldn't shoot straight.
Mesa Vista was a lot to keep up, though, and Mr. Pickens listed it for sale in late 2017. The asking price: $250 million.
Mr. Pickens closed his energy-focused hedge fund early last year amid declining health and waning interest in energy markets. ""If you are lucky enough to make it to 89 years of age like I have, those things tend to put life in perspective,"" he said at the time. ""Trading oil is not as intriguing to me as it once was.""
Shortly thereafter, some of Mr. Pickens' lieutenants started the Pickens Oil Response Exchange Traded Fund, which
was tailored to mimic his investing philosophies
and wager on U.S. energy abundance. This summer, the ETF, just as the oilman once did, changed its focus from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Its ticker symbol changed too, to RENW.
Mr. Pickens is survived by his five children—Deborah Pickens Stovall, Pam Pickens Grace, Michael Pickens, Tom Pickens and Liz Pickens Cordia—as well as 11 grandchildren and ""an increasing number of great-grandchildren,"" according to his family.
Memorial services are planned in Dallas, where he lived, and Stillwater, Okla., home of Oklahoma State, where he is set to be buried on campus.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Concerns about shale have roared in recently like a Texas tornado -- sudden and violent.
Permian Basin oil-and-gas driller Concho Resources posted a 25% drop in adjusted second-quarter earnings Wednesday night despite a year-over-year increase of more than 40% in oil and natural-gas volume. The results sent Concho's shares plunging by over one-fifth on Thursday.
Concho wasn't alone: Whiting Petroleum's shares were off by more than one-third after a surprise quarterly loss. The results dragged down shares of other regional drillers including Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley Energy.
Prices for oil and gas were lower in the quarter, which didn't help, but costs were the real culprit in Concho's disappointing results. They underscore challenges shale drilling poses for energy producers. At Concho, higher volume helped push up total operating revenue by more than 19%.
However, extracting the oil using water and sand at high pressure is increasingly expensive. Total operating costs and expenses more than doubled in the second quarter.
Shareholders have become more sensitive to the cost side of the equation recently and have pressured drillers to rein in spending and to focus on returning cash. It isn't working.
In the first quarter of this year a basket of seven unconventional oil-focused drillers collectively reported free cash flow of negative $1.58 billion, according to Wood Mackenzie -- more than twice their free-cash-flow burn in the fourth quarter of 2018 and more than four times worse than during the first quarter of 2018.
Shale is uniquely problematic because of rapid production-decline rates and the constant need to reinvest.
Other drilling, such as deep-water, has high upfront costs but relatively modest continuing investment.
True, other producers are less nimble than shale producers and are making more of an outright long-term bet on commodity prices, but investors seem to have rediscovered the charms of conventional-oil production.
For example, Hess Corp, in a partnership with Exxon Mobil, has plunged into a big project in Guyana.
Hess's return on invested capital has been negative since oil prices collapsed in 2014, yet its shares are suddenly in favor again, rising almost 60% so far this year.
Other Permian drillers such as Pioneer Natural Resources have started to rethink their ambitious targets and instead are slimming down operations.
Conversely, big integrated oil companies such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil have raised their spending on shale while Occidental Petroleum has launched an ambitious deal for Anadarko Petroleum to plunge further into the area.
The wisdom of those bets will take years to dissect, but for now the wind suddenly seems to be blowing the wrong way.

Early this year, Scott Sheffield realized he had a problem. Investors were cooling on Pioneer Natural Resources Co., the company he built into one of the leaders of the American fracking boom.
Like many shale companies, Pioneer was pumping a lot but making little. It was spending hundreds of millions more than budgeted as it strained to meet a goal Mr. Sheffield set years back -- producing a million barrels of oil and gas a day within a decade, enough to rival OPEC nations such as Libya.
So in February, the company's board replaced Chief Executive Timothy Dove, who had presided over the cost overruns, with Mr. Sheffield, who had retired as CEO in 2016, and asked him to engineer a turnaround.
Mr. Sheffield has since embarked on an extreme belt-tightening regimen at the Irving, Texas-based producer. Pioneer is cutting more than one-quarter of its workforce, including a cadre of senior executives, in part through layoffs and buyouts. Among those who are leaving is Mr. Sheffield's own brother, Thomas Sheffield, the company's vice president of health, safety and environment.
The million-barrel-a-day goal? It's on ice as Mr. Sheffield tries to convince skeptics that Pioneer is a shale company that can live within its means.
""We lost the growth investors,"" he said in a recent interview. ""Now we've got to attract a whole other set of investors.""
Shale drillers transformed the U.S. into the world's largest oil producer, churning out roughly 12 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Information Administration. But after years of losing money, they are coming under intense pressure from investors and Wall Street financiers to boost returns. How they respond will shape America's heady pursuit of ""energy independence"" and its burgeoning status as a geopolitical oil player.
Companies long valued on growth prospects are seeing new capital dry up as many find it more expensive than anticipated to meet lofty production goals. Under pressure to generate positive cash flows, executives are slashing overhead and dialing back drilling plans.
As the frenzy slows, the pace of U.S. production growth is set to moderate this year. Many older wells are falling short of expectations, and some operators acknowledge that they have fewer future drilling locations than they once predicted.
Over the past 10 years, 40 of the largest independent oil and gas producers collectively spent roughly $200 billion more than they took in from operations, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from financial-information firm FactSet. During that time, a broad index of U.S. oil-and-gas companies fell roughly 10%, while the S&P 500 index nearly tripled.
""It's time to be smarter about being responsible stewards of capital,"" said John Groton, director of equity research for Thrivent Asset Management, a Pioneer investor with about $19 billion under management.
At Pioneer, some employees were concerned about the feasibility of meeting the million-barrel-a-day target set by senior executives, former employees said in interviews with the Journal. Some also raised questions about whether Pioneer's production forecasts were too optimistic and would lead investors to overvalue the company, former employees said.
Pioneer said in a written statement the target was achievable and designed to challenge employees, noting that Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. recently announced similar goals. Pioneer added that it encourages employees to debate the assumptions used to make decisions.
""To date, our well results have, on average, been consistent with our expectations,"" Pioneer said.
Mr. Sheffield said the company had become overly focused on growth. ""I just don't think the discipline was there on the capital side,"" he said. Mr. Dove, the former CEO, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Shale wells produce a lot of oil and gas early on, but taper off quickly, meaning drillers must continuously plow money back into the ground to maintain output. The Journal previously reported that thousands of wells drilled in the last five years are producing less oil and gas than companies forecast to investors. Pioneer is among the companies whose wells in some areas are on track to fall short of expectations, according to the Journal's analysis. The company disputes the findings, saying its methodology for estimating well productivity differs from the Journal's.
Pioneer was formed in 1997 after Mr. Sheffield merged his family's company, Parker & Parsley Petroleum Co., with wildcatter T. Boone Pickens's Mesa Inc. At the time, the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, once a powerhouse oil field that helped the Allied campaign in World War II, had turned into a sleepy province of smaller, low-margin companies.
In one deal after another, Mr. Sheffield, a Dallas native and petroleum engineer trained at the University of Texas, steered Pioneer toward international prospects. He always kept his eye on the Permian Basin, associates say, refusing to sell its holdings there because he valued the predictable returns.
About a decade ago, Pioneer and other smaller operators in West Texas came to understand that new hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies could be applied to the Permian's oil-soaked layers of rock. The innovations led to a renaissance for the Permian, which has since become the chief engine of the American shale boom.
As ""Permania"" took off, Mr. Sheffield emerged as its central pitchman. He made frequent television and conference appearances to talk up the basin's abundance of oil. He developed a knack for using figures that forecast the scale of the coming boom, frequently comparing the Permian to prolific areas of Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Sheffield began laying out an ambitious vision for Pioneer's future. In 2014, he said the company had an inventory of wells to last as many as 150 years. That year he told Forbes he believed Pioneer could increase its output to one million barrels a day by 2024, from about 200,000 barrels.
Infusions of money from Wall Street, eager for a piece of the fracking action, fueled growth at Pioneer and other shale companies. Frackers tapped investors for more than $176 billion in financing from 2015 to 2018, using debt and sales of new shares to continue increasing production. Pioneer financed its expansion during that time with $3.57 billion in bond and equity deals, according to Dealogic.
""It wasn't how much money you were making. It was, 'How many locations do you have?'"" said Jon Brumley, a former chairman of Pioneer's board.
Mr. Sheffield spoke optimistically about returns on the company's wells, but that didn't always translate to overall profits.
In August 2015, Mr. Sheffield said Pioneer's wells were expected to yield 45% to 60% returns on investment at the oil prices at that time, excluding costs such as administrative expenses and taxes. The company lost $218 million in the second quarter of that year.
The company acknowledged that capital spending exceeded operating cash flow in 2015, but said it is focused on changing that in 2019 and beyond.
In late 2016, Mr. Sheffield pushed back the timeline of the million-barrel goal by two years, to 2026. He stepped down as CEO at the end of that year and retired to the Santa Fe, N.M., area, where he had bought a 2,300-acre ranch from actress Jane Fonda.
That left his handpicked successor, Mr. Dove, to complete Pioneer's transformation. Mr. Dove, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, sought to make the million-barrel goal part of the company's strategic plan.
In early 2017, he gathered employees at a Dallas opera house to formally unveil the goal, a move that took some employees by surprise. He later told investors that Pioneer would reach that target by increasing output by at least 15% annually. He also said the company would bring spending in line with cash flow by 2018, assuming a $55 oil price.
Some employees were less confident. Several times in recent years, technical staffers raised concerns to management that Pioneer was being too aggressive with how it talked up its prospects to investors and potential business partners, according to people familiar with the matter.
In one of those instances, the company eventually walked back internal production forecasts for some of its wells in the Permian, according to one of the people. In other instances, Pioneer continued to use what some of the people said were overly optimistic estimates.
Pioneer now says its oil output has been consistent with expectations, and that it has produced more natural gas and natural-gas liquids than expected. It says well productivity has become more predictable as it has drilled more wells and gathered additional data.
Pioneer ran into operational difficulties trying to produce as much oil as it had forecast. In a rocky conference call in August 2017, Mr. Dove disclosed it had drilled a series of ""train-wreck wells"" and said it would be lowering its oil production target for the year. The company's stock fell 11% on the news.
Under pressure to meet quarterly output targets, Pioneer began what employees called ""the production push,"" according to one former employee. It drilled two West Texas wells to horizontal distances of 6,200 and 6,400 feet, according to data from energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie -- barely half the 12,100 feet the company had permits to drill.
That allowed the wells to be finished faster and contribute sooner to quarterly results, the person said, but at the cost of reducing their total long-term production. After 16 months, the wells generated about 125,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil, respectively, according to ShaleProfile, an industry analytics platform. Pioneer's average Permian well from 2017 generated about 212,000 barrels of oil in that time, ShaleProfile data show.
Pioneer said it didn't drill shorter wells to accelerate production. ""It is not unusual to drill shorter lateral wells for a variety of reasons, including to reduce the risk of operational challenges associated with longer lateral lengths,"" the company said.
Last year, Pioneer's board grew more concerned about exceeding the budget, chairman J. Kenneth Thompson said in an interview. Shareholders were ratcheting up pressure to moderate growth and spending. Pioneer spent $549 million more than it took in from operations in 2018, according to FactSet, even though U.S. benchmark crude prices rose to an average of $65 a barrel. Many competitors also overshot their budgets, few by as much as Pioneer.
Pioneer's board approved a $500 million increase in the company's capital budget, to between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, in the middle of last year, but was surprised to learn in January about additional overspending of about $350 million, Mr. Sheffield said.
By late February, Pioneer's shares had declined about 40% from their 2014 peak. The board, with Mr. Sheffield as chairman, reached a ""strong consensus"" that major cost reductions were necessary, and Mr. Dove elected to retire, the company said.
Mr. Thompson, the current chairman, said the board wanted to cut overhead to $2.25 per barrel of oil and gas produced, from $3.26, and that Mr. Dove had opposed such moves, which would require layoffs.
In his first year back as CEO, Mr. Sheffield wants to generate roughly $800 million in excess cash, which would demonstrate that Pioneer can meet investor demands for profits, cash flow and growth. In addition to the job cuts, it sold acreage in South Texas and is looking to shed assets used to process natural gas.
Pioneer's shares temporarily surged after Chevron sought to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Mr. Sheffield made clear he isn't interested in selling Pioneer. He also isn't quite letting go of his million-barrel goal.
""I can't guarantee we're going to grow 15% a year if I don't know what the oil price is,"" he said, explaining it could take as long as 15 years if the industry experiences more downturns. ""But my point is the rock will produce over one million barrels a day,"" he said.

Mr. Thompson, the current chairman, said the board wanted to cut overhead to $2.25 per barrel of oil and gas produced, from $3.26, and that Mr. Dove had opposed such moves, which would require layoffs.
In his first year back as CEO, Mr. Sheffield wants to generate roughly $800 million in excess cash, which would demonstrate that Pioneer can meet investor demands for profits, cash flow and growth. In addition to the job cuts, it sold acreage in South Texas and is looking to shed assets used to process natural gas.
Pioneer's shares
temporarily surged after
Chevron sought to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Mr. Sheffield made clear he isn't interested in selling Pioneer. He also isn't quite letting go of his million-barrel goal.
""I can't guarantee we're going to grow 15% a year if I don't know what the oil price is,"" he said, explaining it could take as long as 15 years if the industry experiences more downturns. ""But my point is the rock will produce over one million barrels a day,"" he said.
Based on its existing well production and drilling practices, Pioneer would need as many as 90 rigs—about four times its current total—to reach one million barrels a day by 2026, estimates Tom Loughrey, president of oil-and-gas consulting firm Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners LLC. ""This is really outside the realm of possibility,"" he said.
Pioneer has told investors it would take 60 to 70 rigs to produce one million barrels a day by 2026. It said it hoped drilling advances would allow it to reach the target with fewer rigs.

Frackers are set to plow more cash into oil fields this year compared with last, but it isn't expected to unleash the flood of crude that past spending binges in the shale patch have.
EOG Resources Inc. said it would spend about $1.4 billion more than last year, but that its oil production would rise by about 3% in 2023. Pioneer Natural Resources Co. said it would augment its budget by nearly $1 billion, but its production would increase by less than 7% from 2022. And Marathon Oil Corp. said that although its expenses would jump by up to 35%, its production would remain flat.
The disconnect between spending and production gains makes for a murky outlook for oil and gas producers in 2023, analysts said. It comes after many producers rode high oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine to record profits in 2022, but suggests their ability to grow is limited.
EOG reported this week that its yearly profit jumped $3 billion to $7.7 billion. Pioneer said it netted $7.8 billion last year, almost four times what it made in 2021. Diamondback Energy Inc. said its net income more than doubled from 2021 to $4.5 billion. These three companies churned out more than $20 billion in free cash flow last year, compared with $11.1 billion in 2021.
Those profits may be difficult to replicate. The industry is dealing with inflation, which sent the price of equipment, labor and materials to new heights, analysts said. Drillers are warning they will have to splurge more to extract the same volumes of hydrocarbons, in part because shale fields from North Dakota to Texas, the oil basket of America, are maturing.
Shale companies in the past decade capitalized on low-cost debt to fuel explosive growth in the oil patch, which contributed to a glut of supply and a collapse in oil prices in 2014 to 2016. The free spending led to multibillion-dollar losses and angered investors.
Drillers pledged to rein in spending and focus on capital returns and showered their investors with cash last year. According to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, through the third quarter of 2022, a group of 38 shale companies distributed $42 billion to stockholders through dividends and buybacks -- slightly more than what these companies spent on production over the same period.
The fact that companies have moved to funnel most of their cash back to shareholders, and not into squeezing out new molecules, has become a source of pride for oil bosses. Marathon Oil Chief Executive Lee Tillman told investors earlier this month that his company had ""the lowest reinvestment rate in our peer group, a full 10 percentage points below the S&P 500 average.""
The companies' frugality has attracted investors: In the past year, the S&P 500 Energy stocks increased by over 26%, even as the broader index fell 5%.
The industry is now reversing its austerity measures. Investment bank Evercore ISI estimated in December that shale companies' budgets would increase by 46% in 2023, putting U.S. spending on par with levels last seen in 2009 -- about half its historical peak. That rise follows a 30% increase in spending last year from 2021, according to Wood Mackenzie. In 2022, the 51 largest U.S. shale companies spent $52.6 billion on oil fields, the firm said.
Drillers say they are spending more to keep production roughly flat. Their budget increases in 2022 resulted in a 4% increase in oil production for the group, according to Wood Mackenzie's models. Companies largely attributed their ballooning budgets in 2022 and this year to inflation, which raised the cost of labor and materials by around 20%, as well as to one-time items, such as well maintenance.
But some frackers, such as Pioneer, said they have been dealing with capricious wells. The driller last year said its Permian Basin wells had disappointed, and that it would reshuffle its drilling portfolio to generate higher returns in 2023.
In addition to productivity troubles, frackers face an existential predicament: fewer sweet spots to drill, analysts said. Shale executives privately concede the problem and in earnings calls this month tried to reassure investors they had ample running room, pointing to recent acquisitions that added to their inventories of drilling locations.
Marathon's Mr. Tillman, for instance, said the company bought Ensign Natural Resources, in the Eagle Ford region of Texas, last year as it looked for ""assets or opportunities that would also have a net positive effect on inventory life.""

Energy exploration and production company EOG Resources had a boffo 2022, and one of its directors made his second purchase of shares in three months.
EOG stock (ticker: EOG) surged 46% last year, lifted by rising oil prices . The company also announced a strong third quarter in November, along with a higher dividend . ""EOG is in a better position than ever to deliver value for our shareholders and play a significant role in the long-term future of energy,"" the company said.
On Jan. 12, EOG director Mike Kerr paid $2.6 million for 20,000 shares, at an average price of $130.49 each. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Kerr purchased the shares through a family trust that now owns 170,000 EOG shares. Kerr also owns 10,854 EOG shares through a personal account.
EOG didn't make Kerr available for comment. An EOG director since 2020, Kerr is a former equity portfolio manager at Capital Group, the sponsor of American Funds.
Kerr's last open-market purchase of EOG stock came in November, when he paid $4.3 million for 50,000 shares, at an average price of $86 each. He bought the shares through his personal account. In December, he transferred 150,000 EOG shares to the family trust from that personal account.
On Jan. 11, John Gerdes, president of Gerdes Energy Research, initiated coverage of EOG Resources stock at Buy with a $164 price target. He expects EOG to generate about $31.3 billion of free cash flow from 2023 through 2027.

Oil and gas companies could face more stringent regulations under Democratic control of the White House and Congress. But analysts remain confident about their prospects, as political shifts often result in surprising changes.
In fact, President-elect Joe Biden's victory has
coincided with a runup in prices
even though he is considered to be less of a friend to the industry than a Republican administration would have been.
Truist analyst Neal Dingmann found six stocks he calls ""Democrat Darlings"" that could do especially well in the next year—both because they can handle any new regulatory requirements, and because their core businesses are set up well to generate cash in the current environment.
His favorite stocks for the coming political shift include several stocks whose free cash flow is likely to grow considerably at higher oil prices. They also tend to have relatively low debt. These ""Democrat Darlings"" include Apache (ticker: APA), Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), EOG Resources (EOG), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Penn Virginia (PVAC).
Dingmann wrote that the most likely changes to come out of Congress and the Biden White House are
limits on drilling on federal land and tax increases
. Biden has said he wants to raise corporate taxes, reversing about half of the cuts that President Trump and Republicans made in 2017.
Democrats could also change tax rules targeted at oil and gas names, including amending a break that allows companies to deduct most of the cost of drilling new wells, known as intangible drilling costs. Biden could delay or stop new pipelines as well, after the Trump administration had eased their regulatory path.
For oil companies, several of those changes could pinch profits and future growth. But Dingmann noted that most oil and gas companies did so poorly in the last few years that they'll be able to carry forward considerable net operating losses, and potentially pay ""little cash taxes in the coming years,"" he wrote.
Biden has also called for an end to new permits on federal land. In anticipation, producers filed permits for new leases in a rush last year, with nearly 3,800 being approved in the second half of the year, Dingmann noted. Those permits tend to last for several years, so the companies could be insulated from changes in the near term. EOG, for example, has high exposure to federal land, but got 620 federal permit approvals in the second half of last year, the most of any operator. The fourth quarter permit haul was the largest of the Trump years, he wrote.
EOG shares were up 2.4% around midday Thursday, while the S&P 500 was up 0.2%. Apache stock gained 4.9%, Devon shares advanced 6.2%, Diamondback rose 2.2%, Marathon Oil rallied 8.3%, and Penn Virginia gained 3.1%.

Oil-and-gas companies are accelerating investments in geothermal energy, betting the technologies that fueled the shale revolution can turn the budding industry into a large producer of clean power.
Chevron, BP and Devon Energy are part of a group of fossil-fuel companies investing hundreds of millions of dollars in modern geothermal startups and projects. Many of these companies are using the same technology employed by frackers, but instead of searching for oil and gas, they are looking for underground heat.
The new geothermal industry is the result of a surprising confluence of interests among the oil-and-gas, technology and green-power industries. The heat that the drillers find underground can be used to generate a steady, round-the-clock supply of carbon-free electricity, which is coveted by tech companies for their power-hungry data centers.
Finding pockets of underground heat is relatively easy in places with lots of geothermal activity, including parts of the U.S., Indonesia and New Zealand. When the heat is deeper in the earth, it is more difficult and more expensive to find. Those constraints have kept the sector's share of U.S. electricity generation at less than 1%.
Technological advances in well drilling, modeling and sensor technology are expected to change that: The Energy Department estimates geothermal energy could power the equivalent of more than 65 million U.S. homes by 2050.
New funding for a startup called Fervo Energy follows drilling results showing declining costs in the sector.
The industry began changing about five years ago, when companies like Google launched efforts to run their operations on renewable power 24/7 and found that wind and solar, which can't supply uninterrupted power, couldn't get there on their own.
""It created this huge market momentum around looking at something new,"" said Tim Latimer, Fervo's chief executive. ""That's what allowed us to put geothermal on the map for the first time in a long time.""
Geothermal energy is more typically used for heating and cooling. This process relies on the steady underground temperature a short distance below the surface. That reduces the amount of heating and cooling needed on hot and cold days.
Fervo, by using horizontal drilling and pumping water underground through fractures in rock in a process similar to fracking, found that many more parts of the world could economically generate electricity from geothermal energy.
After the water is heated up deep underground, it returns to the surface, where it transfers the heat to another liquid with a lower boiling point. That generates steam, which spins turbines for generating electricity. Geothermal power is currently much pricier than wind, solar and natural-gas power, putting pressure on the industry to reduce costs.
Fervo is raising $244 million from investors including Devon, billionaire former Enron trader John Arnold, Liberty Mutual Investments and commodity trader Mercuria. Devon is putting in $100 million, one of the biggest such investments by an oil-and-gas company in a clean-energy startup.
BP was among the investors that recently put $182 million into Canadian startup Eavor Technologies, which counts Chevron among its early backers and tries to simplify geothermal by essentially burying a large radiator deep underground and circulating fluid through it. Chesapeake Energy recently made an early stage bet on a startup called Sage Geosystems that is led by a former Shell executive.
Old oil-and-gas wells could be retrofitted to produce geothermal power, while existing wells can extract geothermal energy alongside fossil fuels, potentially helping accelerate the industry's growth.
Oil companies understand subsurface geology, have experience building infrastructure projects and have cash available to deploy. That is why Chevron is joining with other companies and pursuing geothermal pilot projects in Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., said Barbara Harrison, vice president of offsets and emerging technologies at Chevron New Energies.
""We are choosing to pursue direct investment in novel geothermal technologies in a way that we've not directly invested in wind or solar,"" she said.
About 60% of Fervo's roughly 80 employees have an oil-and-gas background, said Latimer, a Texas native and former drilling engineer for BHP Billiton.
Fervo said drilling costs for its first four horizontal wells for a project in Utah fell to $4.8 million per well from $9.4 million a couple of years ago at its first commercial project in Nevada. The company aims to soon reach electricity costs around $100 per megawatt hour.
Fervo recently began sending electricity from the Nevada operation to the local grid to power Google data centers and other local projects. In Utah, it hopes to produce enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes.
""Once the industry is proven, I would not be surprised for today's oil-and-gas industry to either buy or build their way to be significant players in advanced geothermal,"" said Arnold, a widely followed energy investor who put $30 million into Fervo through his family office.
Google is looking for more potential sites for geothermal power, said Maud Texier, the company's global director of clean energy and decarbonization development. Companies are willing to pay more for geothermal because it can be a hedge against wind and solar, she said. ""Corporate buyers have a key role to play,"" Texier said.
Additional support is coming from Washington. The Energy Department recently granted $60 million to a trio of projects from companies including Chevron and Fervo, with a further boost coming from tax credits that were part of the 2022 climate law.

| Jump to first hitThe founders of Oklahoma’s largest oil companies say Chesapeake’s emergence as the nation’s largest independent natural gas producer will strengthen Oklahoma City’s energy industry and power the local economy to even more growth.Devon Energy co-founder Larry Nichols and Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm say Chesapeake’s announced merger with Southwest Energy last week will give Oklahoma City more of an edge in recruiting corporate talent from other oil and gas hubs like Houston, Dallas and Denver.But that’s not all, said Nichols, who now serves as chairman emeritus at Devon. Chesapeake’s deal raises Oklahoma City’s profile even higher in the energy space, and the entire community will benefit from that.Chesapeake and Southwest startled Wall Street and the energy industry last week when they announced plans to merge to form a natural gas behemoth with capacity to deliver gas to the nation and the world. Once the deal is completed in the second quarter, a combined company will emerge with an enterprise value of about $24 billion.Chesapeake’s decision to stay in Oklahoma City came as no surprise, said Nichols, who guided Devon through several multi-billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions while serving as the company’s chief executive and chairman of the board.“In all mergers, when it comes to social issues like headquarters location, who the CEO will be, and who’s on the board, the larger company gets to decide,” Nichols said. “In all the deals Devon did, we were the larger company. That’s why we survived.”Chesapeake’s emergence as a larger and stronger energy company will enhance Oklahoma City’s reputation, he said.“It will be good to have three large energy companies and not just two and a smaller one,” he said. “The addition of Chesapeake as a large publicly traded company helps advertise the city as a great place for other companies to come and do business.”“I’m very excited about it,” Hamm agreed. “This takes me back to the days when Continental moved from Enid to Oklahoma City. Larry Nichols was the most supportive of the move. We could have moved to Dallas, Houston or anywhere and he said come to Oklahoma City. Now, we have a wonderful community we all contribute to.”All of the energy companies benefit from strong engineering and geology programs at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University, and it’s good to have all three pioneers in shale oil and gas production in the same place, Hamm said.Multiple community benefitsChesapeake supports a lot of the same charities as Continental, and if they weren’t here, it would leave a big vacuum that would be hard to fill, he added. This is good for Oklahoma City’s arts community and cultural organizations as well as medical research, sports, entertainment, and quality of life.Having three large energy producers in Oklahoma City is also good for employees because it gives them options where they can work, he said. All the companies compete for the same people and that makes the three companies better employers, he said.The merger will strengthen the stature of Oklahoma City and Oklahoma as the epicenter of the diversified shale business, said Continental Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler.“This gives us optimism in the future as an oil and gas center,” Lawler said. “With the strength of the three companies, it helps strengthen the industry within Oklahoma.”Prior to taking his role at Continental, Lawler served as Chesapeake’s CEO from 2013 to 2021, the company’s most turbulent period, marked by the death of Chesapeake founder Aubrey McClendon, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and involvement by activist investor Carl Icahn.The company eventually overcame billions of dollars in debt, emerged from bankruptcy and recovered to resume business as one of the industry’s top performers.“It took several years to transition Chesapeake to success from those hard times,” Lawler said. “The company is taking all that we learned, and it is using the good things from that experience.”“I’m excited that they are staying in OKC,” Lawler said. “We wish them the very best in their endeavors, and we’re excited for them.”Jake Dollarhide, energy industry watcher and chief executive of Tulsa’s Longbow Asset Management, said the merger is a great story for the state and the industry. The deal is indicative of the enhanced role natural gas will play in the world’s energy future.Russian President Vladamir Putin set the stage when he invaded Ukraine and disrupted the reliability of natural gas supplies to Europe and other parts of the world, Dollarhide said. Natural gas has come a long way from the days when it was “second fiddle’ to oil.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The smell of mergers and acquisitions is in the air after more than $110 billion of oil megadeals this month -- Chevron's agreement to buy Hess and Exxon Mobil's deal for Pioneer Natural Resources.
Devon Energy is said to be eyeing targets that include Marathon Oil and CrownRock, according to a report from Bloomberg. Gas producer Chesapeake Energy is reportedly considering an acquisition of Southwestern Energy, according to Reuters.
Between the declining pool of quality shale inventory and the limited number of sizable targets in the Permian Basin, energy companies could soon be forced into deal-making action.
The fear-of-missing-out ""component of it is only going to accelerate. See one or two more deals, and there could be a scarcity premium that starts to emerge,"" said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.
Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy and Diamondback Energy are among the largest producers in the Permian, according to data from Enverus, and are large enough that they could be a potential target or an acquirer, according to Pickering. All three have estimated resource lives of roughly 30 years or more, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.
While EOG Resources is one of the top producers there, the company has been more interested in asset acquisitions rather than corporate deals, Pickering added. Smaller Permian producers, those with sub-$10-billion market capitalizations, include Matador Resources and Permian Resources, which agreed to acquire Earthstone Energy in August.
ConocoPhillips could be another acquirer. Given major European oil companies' lagging valuations and the pressure they face to decarbonize, they seem less likely to throw their hats into the ring.
The market was ripe for consolidation. In a white paper published in June, energy asset manager Kimmeridge noted there are ""too many public companies relative to the degree of investor interest"" for U.S. oil and gas producers. In its analysis of filings for the five largest active fund managers (including Fidelity and J.P. Morgan), it found those managers' holdings of the five largest energy companies in the S&P 500 expanded from 40% to 53% of U.S. energy holdings in the second quarter of 2023, compared with the same period five years earlier. At the same time, holdings of smaller energy companies declined.
The valuation gap between the energy giants and the smaller producers has widened. An index that is heavily weighted toward Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other large producers commands a valuation, measured as enterprise value as a multiple of forward-12-month Ebitda, that is 44% higher than an index tracking smaller producers. The premium averaged 14% over the past 17 years and, at the peak of optimism about the shale patch, there was a time when small, fast-growing frackers were valued more highly than larger, less nimble peers.
There is reason to think the wave of deal-making might not be fast and furious. Kimmeridge portfolio manager Mark Viviano argued that, in many cases, entrenched executives and boards at potential target companies don't have an incentive to green light deals. In a previous report, Kimmeridge noted most chief executives of exploration and production companies own very little stock directly and their skills typically aren't transferable outside the industry, making exits undesirable.
The Exxon Mobil-Pioneer deal ""was headline grabbing and I'm hoping it serves as a catalyst, but I'm naturally skeptical,"" Viviano said.
Betting on the next target is tricky, but the trend of consolidation should be bullish for energy-sector investors. While Exxon Mobil signaled the combination with Pioneer will result in more production than if the companies had remained independent, other consolidations over the past 18 months have involved a reduction in rig count, according to Robert Clarke, vice president of upstream research at Wood Mackenzie. As long as future consolidations result in more reductions, it should be supportive for commodity prices and returns.
The growth FOMO that plagued drillers during the shale boom was unhealthy. Consolidation FOMO is one investors can applaud.

Large troves of lithium will be needed to make the batteries for growing numbers of electric cars on the road. To find new supplies, companies and researchers are turning to an unexpected source: oil-and-gas reservoirs.
These oil-and-gas sites harbor not only hydrocarbons, but also brine that contains metals including sodium, calcium and some lithium. When drillers poke holes into oil-saturated formations, the brine flows back to the surface along with the molecules that end up as fuel, and companies have been prompt to discard the earthy marinade. But now that the EV battery material has become a prized commodity, lithium companies are developing technologies to remove it from this brine --and oil-and-gas companies are also taking a second look.
The process, known as direct lithium extraction, could mark a new era for the industry, researchers and analysts say.
Extraction can be labor-intensive and has yet to be commercialized at scale, but rising demand for lithium is increasing the focus on new methods. ""We need to rethink and look at assets that will require modern processes to unlock,"" says Robert Mintak, the chief executive of Vancouver-based Standard Lithium.
In Arkansas, now a minor producer of oil and gas, Standard Lithium is running a demonstration plant to extract lithium from oil-field brine. In Canada, the company E3 Lithium is working with an oil-and-gas company to produce the metal from a depleted oil-production field. And in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico, driller Devon Energy is testing techniques with other companies to produce lithium from wastewater it pumps alongside oil and gas.
Demand for lithium batteries is projected to shoot up this decade, with U.S. demand expected to increase by nearly six times by 2030 to reach $52 billion, according to a Boston Consulting Group analysis. Billions of dollars in government subsidies are also bolstering companies' bets on finding new ways to extract the metal.
Now, most of the world's lithium supply comes from Australia, Chile and China. They provided about 92% of the 130,000 metric tons of lithium extracted globally last year, according to investment bank Raymond James. Producers crush rocks to extract lithium, or collect it by pumping shallow subterranean brines --which offer much higher concentrations of lithium than oil-field brines --and pouring it into gigantic evaporation ponds. This involves using large amounts of water, and environmental groups say the ponds can contaminate the air and soil.
Tapping the brine in North America's oil fields with direct lithium extraction is less damaging, companies and researchers say. Because energy companies have drilled millions of oil-and-gas wells and collected subsurface data in the process, lithium prospectors know where to look.
Direct extraction could also speed up lithium production. Concentrating lithium in brine ponds can take up to 18 months and recovers about 50% of the lithium, according to an April report by Goldman Sachs. In direct extraction, brine is sent to a processing unit, where chemicals, a resin or a membrane are used to capture the lithium ions. The water is then reinjected into the aquifer where it originated. The process takes at most a few days, and recoveries are up to 90%. Analysts say direct-extraction technologies could be applied to lithium-rich shallow brines as well.
The technology presents some challenges. Because each brine is a unique broth of chemicals, collecting lithium through direct extraction will require tailored approaches for each project, says Kevin Murphy, director of metals and mining research at S&P Global Commodity Insights. The lower the concentration of lithium in the brine, the higher the operating costs, as producers need to process more water. The presence of other elements can also interfere with the extraction process, Murphy says.
In Canada's Alberta province, E3 Lithium aims to coax the metal from the Bashaw district in the depleted Leduc oil field, an area that it estimates contains about 16 million metric tons of lithium -- about five times the estimated lithium in Canada's rock deposits. The company has received Canadian federal grants totaling more than 30 million Canadian dollars (about $22 million). Imperial Oil, an oil producer majority-owned by Exxon Mobil that discovered oil at Leduc, has invested C$6.4 million in E3 Lithium, according to the companies. The partnership grants E3 Lithium access to Imperial Oil's freehold lands and to its water and reservoir-management savvy.
""We operate like conventional oil,"" says E3 Lithium Chief Executive Chris Doornbos.
E3 Lithium, which plans to begin operations at an extraction pilot plant in the third quarter of 2023, hopes to initially produce 20,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year. It aims to pump brine from a depth of 1.5 miles, potentially using existing wells as well as new ones. The liquid will then likely be sent through pipelines to a facility where a sorbent material will capture the lithium and reject impurities to create a concentrated liquid, which then will be further refined into battery-grade material.
The Smackover formation of southern Arkansas is seen as one of the most promising regions in North America to test and deploy the technology. Exxon this year purchased drilling rights to a significant lithium prospect in the region, which it intends to develop, according to people familiar with the matter. The metal's concentration there can be over 500 milligrams per liter, by some estimates, compared with around 75 milligrams per liter in the Leduc field.
Exxon declined to comment.
Chemical companies in the region have long produced brine from depleted oil fields to collect bromine, another valuable chemical in the salt water. Now, lithium companies want to get a piece of the action.
Standard Lithium has been operating an industrial-scale plant in the Smackover area since 2020 with German chemical maker Lanxess. Brine, which Lanxess processes to produce bromine, flows into the facility at the rate of about 3,000 gallons a minute. Using the same brine, Standard Lithium expects to produce just under 6,000 metric tons of lithium annually from this plant and targets a production of 50,000 metric tons across the company's projects in Arkansas, chief executive Mintak says.
Some companies hope the direct-extraction technology will also open the door to producing lithium in the Permian basin of New Mexico and West Texas, the most active oil field in the U.S. Drillers there inject millions of gallons of water down wells to frack shale rock. As this wastewater flows back up along with brine, producers have to dispose of it. The Permian basin produced around 18 million barrels of water a day in 2021, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs. Monetizing the lithium in the salt water could allow the drillers to offset the cost of having to handle it, executives and analysts say.
Permian producer Devon Energy has invested millions of dollars through venture-capital firms into companies working on alternative energy projects and technologies, including direct lithium extraction, says Trey Lowe, the company's chief technology officer. Because lithium is so diluted in Permian water, Devon is working with specialized companies to test techniques that concentrate the metal further, and is looking at ways to extract other valuable chemical elements, such as iodine.
Others are more skeptical. Amanda Brock, the chief executive of Aris Water Solutions, a water-management company in the Permian, says that it has looked into producing lithium from wastewater, but that it doesn't see near-term potential given lithium prices and production costs.
""We would love to find a way to cost-efficiently extract lithium,"" she says.

The partnership grants E3 Lithium access to Imperial Oil's freehold lands and to its water and reservoir-management savvy.
""We operate like conventional oil,"" says E3 Lithium Chief Executive Chris Doornbos.
E3 Lithium, which plans to begin operations at an extraction pilot plant in the third quarter of 2023, hopes to initially produce 20,000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide per year. It aims to pump brine from a depth of 1.5 miles, potentially using existing wells as well as new ones. The liquid will then likely be sent through pipelines to a facility where a sorbent material will capture the lithium and reject impurities to create a concentrated liquid, which then will be further refined into battery-grade material.
The Smackover formation of southern Arkansas is seen as one of the most promising regions in North America to test and deploy the technology. Exxon Mobil this year purchased drilling rights to a significant lithium prospect in the region, which it intends to develop, according to people familiar with the matter. The metal's concentration there can be over 500 milligrams per liter, by some estimates, compared with around 75 milligrams per liter in the Leduc field.
Exxon Mobil declined to comment.
Chemical companies in the region have long produced brine from depleted oil fields to collect bromine, another valuable chemical in the saltwater. Now, lithium companies want to get a piece of the action.
Standard Lithium has been operating an industrial-scale plant in the Smackover area since 2020 with German chemical maker Lanxess. Brine, which Lanxess processes to produce bromine, flows into the facility at the rate of about 3,000 gallons a minute. Using the same brine, Standard Lithium expects to produce just under 6,000 metric tons of lithium annually from this plant and targets a production of 50,000 metric tons across the company's projects in Arkansas, chief executive Mintak says.
Some companies hope the direct-extraction technology will also open the door to producing lithium in the Permian basin of New Mexico and West Texas, the most active oil field in the U.S. Drillers there inject millions of gallons of water down wells to frack shale rock. As this wastewater flows back up along with brine, producers have to dispose of it. The Permian basin produced around 18 million barrels of water a day in 2021, according to investment bank Goldman Sachs. Monetizing the lithium in the saltwater could allow the drillers to offset the cost of having to handle it, executives and analysts say.
Permian producer Devon Energy has invested millions of dollars through venture-capital firms into companies working on alternative energy projects and technologies, including direct lithium extraction, says Trey Lowe, the company's chief technology officer. Because lithium is so diluted in Permian water, Devon is working with specialized companies to test techniques that concentrate the metal further, and is looking at ways to extract other valuable chemical elements, such as iodine.
Others are more skeptical. Amanda Brock, the chief executive of Aris Water Solutions, a water-management company in the Permian, says that it has looked into producing lithium from wastewater, but that it doesn't see near-term potential given lithium prices and production costs.
""We would love to find a way to cost-effectively extract the lithium,"" she says.

The economic highlight of the week comes on Wednesday, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the consumer price index for April. Economists forecast a 5% year-over-year increase, matching the March data. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 5.4%, two-tenths of a percentage point less than previously. Both indexes are well below their peaks from last year but also much higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
On Thursday, the Bank of England is scheduled to announce its next monetary-policy decision. The central bank is widely expected to raise its bank rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 4.5%. The United Kingdom's CPI rose 10.1% in March from the year prior, making it the only Western European country with a double-digit rate of inflation.
Also Thursday, The Department of Labor reports initial jobless claims for the week ending on May 6. Claims averaged 239,250 in April, returning to historical averages after a prolonged period of being below trend, signaling a loosening of a very tight labor market.
And the BLS releases the producer price index for April. The consensus call is for the PPI to increase 2.4% and the core PPI to rise 3.3%. This compares with gains of 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively, in March. The PPI and core PPI are at their lowest levels in about two years.
Finally, on Friday, the University of Michigan releases its consumer sentiment index for May. Economists forecast a dour 62.6 reading, about one point lower than in April. Consumers' year-ahead inflation expectations surprisingly jumped by a percentage point in April to 4.6%.

2791061603,"Feb 25, 2023",Cost inflation takes chunk out of US shale cash haul after bonanza year: Oil &amp; gas,https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/cost-inflation-takes-chunk-out-us-shale-cash-haul/docview/2791061603/se-2?accountid=7064,DVN,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

Persistent cost inflation is putting pressure on US shale oil and gas groups this year, the heads of the sector's largest producers have warned, even as they report record results for 2022.
Companies such as Devon Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources and EOG Resources that lead exploration in shale rock regions earned outsized profits last year after energy prices soared in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Oil and natural gas prices have since slid below levels before the invasion. Costs such as equipment and labour continue to escalate, however, prompting the biggest operators to brace for a smaller cash haul in 2023.
""We've seen anywhere between 30 and 50 per cent inflation — depending on which cost category you're talking about — that's what we're walking into in 2023,"" Jeff Ritenour, chief financial officer of Devon Energy, one of the biggest shale operators, told analysts on its earnings call.
""I know everybody is tired of talking about it — I certainly am as well,"" he said of inflation's impact.
During the past two weeks some of the biggest shale oil operators have reported earnings that dwarfed any previous year, allowing them to shower record returns on shareholders.
Devon's $6bn in annual net profit more than doubled year on year from $2.8bn. Pioneer's more than tripled to $7.9bn from $2.1bn in 2021, its previous record. EOG, which reported on Thursday night, earned $7.8bn, up from $4.7bn the previous year.
Despite the cash bonanza, markets were largely unimpressed. Shares in Devon closed down more than 10 per cent the day after its earnings report revealed higher than expected capital spending to cover production costs at the end of 2022 and the company said spending would rise another third in 2023. EOG traded 4 per cent lower after market hours late on Thursday after it predicted another sharp rise in wellhead costs in 2023.
Ezra Yacob, EOG's chief executive, bemoaned a ""challenging inflationary environment"" as the group estimated another 4 per cent increase in well costs in 2023 after a 7 per cent rise in 2022.
The cost of casing, the pipe used to line wells, has almost tripled over the past year and a half to $110 a foot, according to Diamondback Energy, another big US shale producer.
Kaes Van't Hof, Diamondback's chief financial officer, told investors this was the ""biggest headwind"" for the sector.
""I think the headwind is going to ease — if not, it's a little bit out of our control,"" he said.
Morgan Stanley said that while there were signs inflation was slowing in some areas, most management teams were still budgeting for a 10-20 per cent rise in capital spending in the year ahead, biting into earnings.
Rystad Energy, a consultancy, estimated free cash flow, a key industry metric defined as cash from operations less capital expenditure, among shale oil producers peaked at $104bn last year. It expects this will fall to about $87bn in 2023 as rising costs drive up spending requirements.
""With oil prices expected to be lower in 2023 and well cost inflation remaining an issue — albeit with the pace of inflation easing — free cash flow will probably be down from 2022 levels,"" said Matthew Bernstein, analyst at Rystad. Shale groups funnelled unprecedented amounts of cash back to shareholders in the forms of dividends and stock buybacks in 2022, responding to Wall Street demands after a decade of debt-fuelled drilling binges that caused investors to flee the sector.
Pioneer returned more than 95 per cent of its $8.4bn free cash flow to shareholders as Scott Sheffield, chief executive, boasted of a ""fortress-like balance sheet"". It will have less money to return this year: 2023 free cash flow is likely to fall to about $4bn, the company said.
Companies vowed to continue returning funds to investors this year, despite pressure from US president Joe Biden to use the cash haul to drill more to bring down prices at the pump for motorists. Biden has accused the companies of ""war-profiteering"".
Bernstein said: ""Significant growth is still off the cards for the majority of public shale oil E&Ps [exploration and production companies], who have continued to set cash return targets over production targets and are not willing to budge from focus on capital discipline.""

Shortly after the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November, Jeff Maggioncalda, the CEO of online education company Coursera Inc., jumped into the technology to see if it could save him time.
He began using the chatbot to draft company letters and notes, and asked his executive assistant to try the same for drafting replies to his inbound emails. She prompts ChatGPT based on how she thinks he would respond, and he edits the answers it generates before sending.
""I spend way more time thinking and way less time writing,"" Mr. Maggioncalda said. ""I don't want to be the one who doesn't use it because someone who is using it is going to have a lot of advantages.""
Around the world, business people across industries including architecture, software and entertainment are testing out tech's new frontier: so-called generative AI programs that produce writing, images and art much like humans do.
In the past, AI was hidden within layers of back-end infrastructure for streamlining logistics or automating content moderation. Now, applications like ChatGPT and the image-generator Midjourney have placed the technology directly into the hands of individuals and small businesses who are using the tools to see if they can automate laborious tasks or speed up creative processes. Some are driven by the thrill of being able to do things not previously possible; others by an existential push to master the nascent technology so they don't fall behind.
The groundswell of experimentation has put larger corporations on notice that such tools could soon shake up their industries. From Netflix Inc. to oil-and-gas producer Devon Energy Corp., some companies have started taking tentative steps with generative AI.
AI experts caution, however, that such tools should only be used to support people who are already experts in their domain. Generative AI has been shown to spew disturbing content and misinformation, while other concerns have surfaced over intellectual property theft and privacy.
""The purpose that it is serving is not to inform you about things you don't know. It's really a tool for you to be able to do what you do better,"" said Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at AI research startup Hugging Face.
Telmo Gomes, the co-founder and IT director of LiveSense, which is based in Melbourne, Australia, said ChatGPT saves him significant time on research. After his company was hired to develop a system that can detect vaping in public places, he spent hours calling people and googling to determine which sensors worked best. Information was limited; other companies selling vaping detection solutions didn't disclose what they were using.
Then he typed the question into ChatGPT. Within a few seconds, it spat back several answers, including ones that exactly mirrored the solutions he had settled on from his research. It also added a note of caution to consider the ethics of monitoring people's behaviors.
""It completely blew my mind,"" Mr. Gomes said. ""We're a small company. It will let us do more with less.""
Nidhi Hegde, a designer at Wimberly Allison Tong & Goo, an architecture firm specializing in luxury hotels, said she concluded generative AI would transform her profession when a client sent her team early concept sketches of the building they wanted, which they had created with Midjourney.
Midjourney, which launched in July, takes a range of prompts from text to three-dimensional forms and gives users a high degree of control to edit its generated images.
The sketches that the client provided are traditionally the architect's job, but Ms. Hegde embraced the process. She fed the client's images back into Midjourney and asked the program to create several new variations with different structures while keeping a similar design. The clients loved the final version, she said.
""The role of the architect really, really changes,"" she said. ""Within the industry, we really have to rethink what we're doing as a service.""
Ms. Hegde now regularly uses Midjourney and dedicates the first half-day of each project to what she calls ""the failure stage."" Once, she fed Midjourney an image of a rock and asked it to ""make the rock gold."" It generated a glittering gold torso of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.
At the Oklahoma headquarters of driller Devon Energy, leadership grew excited about ChatGPT after a group of technicians showed that they could use the tool to test their computer code, said Trey Lowe, the company's chief technology officer. The group manages the firm's automation system, which controls equipment in oil fields.
Separately, engineers and scientists have started using the tool to summarize large technical documents, he said. The experiments persuaded the company to pay close attention to how the technology develops.
Many in white-collar and creative professions fear that once generative AI advances enough, it will replace them the way robots have replaced factory jobs.
In February, Netflix faced backlash on Twitter after saying it used generative AI to create the background images in a short anime film posted on YouTube. Critics said the move threatened to take opportunities away from human artists.
Taiki Sakurai, Netflix's director of anime, said the company is committed to supporting human talent.

The rapid shift is prompting the firm to formalize policies around generative AI, including to consider the ethics and legal ramifications, according to Sean Harry, the company's managing principal of design technology, who is leading the effort.
At the Oklahoma headquarters of driller Devon Energy, leadership grew excited about ChatGPT after a group of technicians showed that they could use the tool to test their computer code, said Trey Lowe, the company's chief technology officer. The group manages the firm's automation system, which controls equipment in oil fields.
Separately, engineers and scientists have started using the tool to summarize large technical documents, he said. The experiments persuaded the company to pay close attention to how the technology develops.
Mr. Lowe said the company hopes ChatGPT will one day be capable of looking up academic repositories and summing up, say, a hundred scientific papers about hydrogen into a concise report. ""For some individuals, just a summary of it will be 100% beneficial to helping them make a decision,"" he said.
Lucas Winterbottom, a software engineer at Hong Kong-based financial-technology startup Reap, began using Copilot, an AI coding assistant , built off an earlier version of ChatGPT's underlying technology, in mid-2022 when it became available to an early batch of testers. He now uses it daily to speed up regular programming tasks, switching to ChatGPT for help in solving less common coding problems.
ChatGPT also helps him get 90% of the way there for drafting internal company notes, he said. ""I'm a tech person,"" he said. ""I don't fully enjoy writing.""
Not everyone has embraced the technology. Andrew Hundt, a robotics researcher, said he avoids coding with generative AI tools because they've been shown to copy chunks of their training data, which he worries could compromise the originality of his research. His opinion of the tools soured after he learned from other users that his own code was turning up in their generated outputs, he said.
Many in white-collar and creative professions also fear that once generative AI advances enough, it will replace them the way robots have replaced factory jobs.
In February, Netflix faced backlash on Twitter after saying it used generative AI to create the background images in a short anime film posted on YouTube that was made as part of a program that experiments with new technology. Critics said the move threatened to take opportunities away from human artists.
Taiki Sakurai, Netflix's director of anime, said the company is committed to supporting human talent.
Publishers including BuzzFeed Inc. and Sports Illustrated publisher Arena Group Holdings, who are testing generative AI to produce articles and content, have said that the tools are intended to assist, not overtake, their staff.
Humans will play the role of providing ideas, ""cultural currency"" and ""inspired prompts,"" BuzzFeed Chief Executive Jonah Peretti wrote in a memo to employees, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Daron Acemoglu, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies technological change, said the impact remains to be seen. ""ChatGPT's claim to fame is that it sounds more like a human. The more human-like it is, the more it can be substituted in for human tasks,"" he said.
Surya Ravikumar, vice president of data and strategy at Singapore-based Smartkarma, a financial investment research network, said that the company has drawn a distinction between which content on its platform should and shouldn't be automated.
The firm, which gives subscribers access to independent investment advice, is testing using ChatGPT to generate summaries and tweets of reports, as well as to draft search-engine optimized corporate blog posts on the basics of investing that are posted outside the platform's paywall.
The company won't use AI to write reports from their experts, Mr. Ravikumar said. ""That's where the true value of our platform lies. We can't be generating that,"" he said.
Cynthia Ting, an architect at American firm NBBJ, says she has watched Midjourney spread like wildfire among her peers. She is working with the Hong Kong chapter of the American Institute of Architects to build a think tank that will help architects learn to use generative AI and other technologies.
""In the future, I feel like AI will be our third brain,"" Ms. Ting said. ""We have our left brain and right brain; sometimes we make decisions by logic, sometimes with emotion. Now we'll have an AI brain to provide us information and data analysis. It will help us to make better decisions.""

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy Corp. on Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of $1.89 billion.On a per-share basis, the Oklahoma City-based company said it had profit of $2.88. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were $2.18 per share.The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.13 per share.The oil and gas exploration company posted revenue of $5.43 billion in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $4.91 billion.“Devon’s third-quarter performance demonstrated the flexibility of our cash-return business model to create value for shareholders in multiple ways,” Devon President and CEO Rick Muncrief commented. “Foundational to our success was the team’s consistent execution of our disciplined plan. This was once again demonstrated by strong well productivity and efficiency gains that drove volumes above the high end of guidance with a capital spend that was below forecast.”Production for the third quarter averaged 614,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, exceeding guidance by 2%. The performance was driven by the company’s Delaware Basin asset that accounted for nearly 70% of total production. Devon’s upstream program in the quarter averaged 21 operated drilling rigs, and 103 gross operated wells were placed online. Total capital spending was $688 million in the third quarter, or 4% below guidance.“Importantly, our strong operating performance resulted in another quarter of impressive financial results that allowed us to reward shareholders with a 61% increase in the dividend payout and our ongoing stock buyback program continued to compound per share growth,” Muncrief continued. “We also took important steps to opportunistically strengthen the quality and depth of our asset portfolio by closing on two highly accretive bolt-on acquisitions that further enhance our ability to deliver sustainable long-term results.”During the quarter, the company closed on acquisitions in the Williston Basin and Eagle Ford for $2.5 billion. After funding them with cash, Devon exited September with cash balances of $1.3 billion and strong investment-grade credit ratings."

| Jump to first hitChampions of the lesser prairie-chicken are awaiting word whether the rare dancing grouse will be relisted under the Endangered Species Act two months after a final decision was expected.The Center for Biological Diversity notified the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on Thursday that it would sue the agency for failing to protect the birds under the ESA if it did not do so within 60 days.The delay is not good because it creates uncertainty, said Wayne Walker, CEO of LPC Conservation, the only private conservation bank for the lesser prairie-chicken in the bird’s range, which includes western Oklahoma.Conservation banks work with landowners to preserve habitat needed to save species in danger of dying out while allowing essential economic drivers to continue development.“They (landowners) get what they need financially, and the bird gets what it needs,” Walker said.As they await the listing decision, conservationists have received some good news.The role of private conservation banks which provide a permanent solution compared to the conservation efforts led by state and regional programs is now being formally recognized by the Fish and Wildlife Service.On July 27, the service announced it is developing specific standards and objectives for private banks and mitigation credits.“The rulemaking is welcomed by the mitigation industry because it will set a standard for mitigation performance for all species going forward,” Walker said. The hope is it will replicate the successful 2008 program for restoration and protection of wetland, he said.Listing the bird under the ESA would require industries to mitigate any negative impacts they have on the species. A decision not to list leaves mitigation efforts to their discretion.A portion of the lesser prairie-chicken’s range overlaps with the oil- and gas-rich Permian Basin. Oil and gas industry trade groups have argued that ongoing voluntary efforts to prevent the bird’s extinction are sufficient and increased federal regulation would harm the industry.Conservationists say the species has suffered serious population declines and needs the protection.Aerial surveys presented by the Western Alliance of Fish and Wildlife Agencies at its summer conference in Oklahoma City showed a 20% decline since 2020. Only 1,500 birds remain in New Mexico and Texas, and about 25,000 in Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma, WAFWA reported.The lesser prairie-chicken was listed as a threatened animal under the federal Endangered Species Act in 2014. Oil and gas companies, wind developers and others that disturbed the ground in the bird’s five-state habitat were required to either avoid its habitat or pay to conserve critical habitat in a different part of the territory.But in 2015, a federal judge reversed the threatened listing for the lesser prairie-chicken. All of the conservation efforts became voluntary.Last year the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed an endangered listing for the bird in southeast New Mexico and West Texas and a threatened listing for the birds in Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma. A decision was expected in June but has been delayed.A species is considered “endangered” by the agency when its extinction is believed imminent, while “threatened” means the animal could soon warrant endangered status.LPC Conservation has 70,000 acres of suitable habitat under contract and 40,000 acres of conservation credits that could be purchased right now by developers who need to compensate for unavoidable adverse impacts their projects have on the species, Walker said.The conservation bank has a range-wide habitat conservation plan specifically for the oil and gas industry that was approved by the Fish and Wildlife Service on June 3. It enables energy developers to obtain legal assurance in exchange for contributing to securing conservation strongholds and habitat restoration, Walker said.“We believe using a market-based business model is the best way to secure the desired outcomes for all involved to finally deliver quantifiable conservation benefits to the lesser prairie-chicken,” he said.WAFWA announced in 2014 that five oil and gas companies voluntarily enrolled nearly 1.5 million acres of land under a plan to conserve the lesser prairie-chicken.Continental Resources, Devon Energy, Apache Corp., Occidental Oil and Gas Corp. and Samson Resources were the first to commit to develop enrolled land in ways that minimize impacts on lesser prairie-chicken habitat and to provide funding for conservation on private land throughout the region.Continental currently has no operations in areas that are known habitats for the lesser prairie-chicken, Kristin Thomas, chief communications officer, said.Lisa Adams, head of corporate communications for Devon Energy, said she was unable to provide information about the company’s efforts by deadline.The WAFWA range-management plan hasn’t worked because agreements are temporary and the programs don’t bring in enough money to pay for what is needed, Walker said.“Wildlife agencies are really good at hunting and fishing, but not when it comes to complicated endangered species mitigation,” Walker said. Conservation bankers are people who know how to work with private landowners and navigate the “quagmire of ESA challenges,” he said.They pay ranchers a lump sum to secure acreage that becomes a permanent conservation easement held by a nonprofit land trust that will pay for the management going forward.The Natural Resources Conservation Service reports about 95% of the lesser prairie-chicken’s habitat is privately owned, making the land management decisions of landowners pivotal to the bird’s success."

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy Corp. posted profits of $1.93 billion in the second quarter, the company reported Monday.On a per-share basis, Oklahoma City-based Devon said it had profit of $2.93. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were $2.59 per share.The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $2.38 per share.The oil and gas exploration company posted revenue of $5.63 billion in the period, also surpassing Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $4.8 billion.The company reported financial highlights for the quarter including:Its fixed-plus-variable dividend increased by 22% to a record-high $1.55 per share.Its share-repurchase program has retired 4% of outstanding shares since inception.Operating cash flow more than doubled year over year and free cash flow reached the highest level in the company’s history.The company employed a disciplined capital allocation framework that moderated reinvestment rates to 22% of cash flow.Its balance sheet strengthened with cash balances increasing by $832 million to a total of $3.5 billion.“The second quarter saw our business continue to strengthen and build momentum as we delivered systematic execution across the financial, operational and strategic tenets of our cash-return business model,” Devon President and CEO Rick Muncrief said in a release. “This success was showcased by production from our Delaware-focused program that exceeded guidance expectations, our streamlined cost structure captured the full benefit of higher commodity prices and we returned record-setting amounts of cash to shareholders. In addition, we took important steps to strengthen the quality and depth of our asset portfolio.”Updated guidanceMuncrief added that as a result of the strong performance Devon has updated its full-year 2022 guidance.Devon is raising its full-year 2022 production forecast by 3% to a range of 600,000 to 610,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The improved volume outlook is due to better-than-expected well performance year-to-date and the effect from a bolt-on acquisition in the Williston Basin. With the ongoing share repurchase program, production per share is expected to grow 8% compared to 2021. The company also adjusted its upstream capital guidance to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion versus prior guidance of approximately $2.1 billion.The updated outlook incorporates $100 million of incremental capital related to the acquisition in the Williston Basin and the effect of inflationary cost pressures. Devon said it expects its capital to be fully funded from operating cash flow, which is forecasted to be nearly $9 billion at current strip pricing.“This improved outlook raises production targets, increases free cash flow projections and enhances our ability to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders,” Muncrief said.The company reported operational highlights for the quarter including:Production averaged 616,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, an increase of 7% from the first quarter of 2022.Oil production accounted for the largest component of the company’s product mix at 49% of total volumes.Upstream capital spending was 5% below guidance, totaling $513 million in the second quarter. Devon’s capital program averaged 19 operated drilling rigs; 67 gross operated wells were placed online during the quarter.Production costs, including taxes, averaged $13.01 per Boe. Devon’s low operating cost structure, coupled with benefits of an oil-weighted production mix, expanded field-level cash margins to $60.12 per Boe in the quarter. That was a 22% improvement from the first quarter of 2022."

Richard E. ""Rick"" Muncrief was a relatively under-the-radar executive at a small oil-and-gas explorer before the Covid pandemic. That changed last year when Muncrief, 63, became CEO of Devon Energy following its merger with his company, WPX Energy.
Muncrief now leads a $35 billion company, and has quickly become a trendsetter in the oil patch, with a generous shareholder-return policy that has inspired admirers—and copycats. That's one reason that more than 60% of the analysts who cover Devon still have Buy ratings on the stock, even after its nearly 90% rise in the past year.
The Top CEOs of 2022
Devon lost nine cents a share in 2020, before Muncrief arrived. It is on track to earn $8.98 this year, helped by the steep rise in oil prices.
More of the company's earnings are going to shareholders, who could receive about $4.75 a share this year. Devon now pays a variable dividend in addition to its fixed dividend of 64 cents a share, a strategy that allows the company to return a growing amount of cash to shareholders when times are good without the threat of a cut when times get tougher.
Devon currently has a dividend yield of about 9%—six times higher than the average S&P 500 company, Muncrief likes to point out. What's more, he has employees on board, too. They ""all own our stock and look forward to that quarterly dividend check just as much as you do,"" he said on a first-quarter earnings call.

Diamondback Energy surged on Tuesday after the oil explorer said it would increase its base dividends from $2.80 to $3 per common share annually, a 7.1% jump, beginning at the end of the month. The implied annual dividend yield is 2.5%, based on Friday's closing price.
The company will also continue the common stock repurchase program it started in September last year. Diamondback (FANG) has bought back approximately $690 million worth of shares and plans to spend up to $2 billion.
""The increased return of capital framework announced today displays the confidence we have in our forward outlook,"" Diamondback CEO Travis Stice, said in a statement. He also expressed confidence that the company's ""strong balance sheet can withstand another down cycle.""
To David Deckelbaum and Kathy Yang of Cowen Equity Research, all this seems ""hard to ignore.""

May was a rocky month for the stock market, but investors were still able to find some winners amid the carnage—especially in the energy sector.
The S&P 500 is down 0.6% this month. That might be somewhat surprising, given that the index dipped dangerously close to bear territory in May, fueling fears that it was approaching a drawn-out bear market.
While many stocks took a hit in May as investors fretted over challenging macroeconomic conditions, some were able to leverage a tough situation.
The energy sector, for example, has significantly outperformed the market, with the S&P 500 Energy Sector index providing a month-to-date return of 16.8%. This was likely driven by surging oil and gas prices, which have remained elevated since February, when Russia invaded Ukraine.
It's no surprise, then, that energy stocks have led the S&P 500's top performers in May. Here's how the index's winners have fared to date.
* Albemarle
Specialty chemicals and materials manufacturer Albemarle Corp. (ticker: ALB) is the top performer in May, gaining 35.1% for the month through Tuesday's close. Albemarle mines lithium and other chemicals that are crucial components for electric-vehicle batteries, and as demand for EVs skyrockets, so has Albemarle's stock. The company recently raised its financial forecasts for the full year, even as others across sectors have lowered their estimates. The forecast update comes only three weeks since management issued previous guidance.
The stock has gained 11.4% this year.
2. Devon Energy
Trailing closely behind Albemarle is Devon Energy (DVN), which is up 28.8% for May. The company engages in oil and gas exploration—a sector that has benefited from rising oil prices. The shares have gained about 70% this year.
3. NRG Energy
Utility company NRG Energy (NRG) has been a more quiet, yet stable, performer this month. The stock surged 28.3% in May, as investors have been steadily flocking to utility stocks as a way to hedge rising inflation. The shares are up 6.9% this year.
4. EPAM Systems
 EPAM Systems (EPAM), a software-design company, said in February it was withdrawing its financial forecasts for the first quarter and all of 2022 after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. The company said in its annual 10K filing that its largest software-development sites, called delivery centers, were in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
Its shares rose 27.8% in May, but are down 49.4% year-to-date.
5. Marathon Oil
Marathon Oil (MRO) is wrapping up a months-long sprint. Shares of the oil producer have risen about 26.1% in May and 59.1% this year. In April, Barron's identified Marathon Oil as an energy stock that has generally traded with particularly low valuations.

First-quarter earnings season continues this week, with more than 150 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report their results for the first three months of 2022. A Federal Reserve interest-rate decision and Jobs Friday will be the economic-data highlights of the week.
The earnings parade begins with Clorox, Devon Energy, Expedia Group, and NXP Semiconductors on Monday, followed by a busy Tuesday: Advanced Micro Devices, Airbnb, Biogen, BP, DuPont, Marathon Petroleum, Paramount Global, Pfizer, and Starbucks all report.
Wednesday's highlights will include Booking Holdings, CVS Health, eBay, Etsy, Moderna, and Uber Technologies. Then Anheuser-Busch InBev, ConocoPhillips, Illumina, Royal Caribbean Group, and Shell report on Thursday and Cigna and Under Armour close the week on Friday.
The Federal Open Market Committee concludes a two-day meeting on Wednesday, when it will announce a monetary-policy decision. Market pricing overwhelming implies expectations of an interest-rate increase of half a percentage point, to a Fed Funds target range of 0.75% to 1%.
Economists will also be closely watching the Bureau of Labor Statistics' April jobs report on Friday morning. The average forecast is for a gain of 375,000 nonfarm payrolls, compared with an increase of 431,000 in March.
Other economic data out this week will include the Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for April on Monday, followed by the Services equivalent on Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitPresident Joe Biden announced Tuesday the U.S. will ban all Russian oil imports and warned that Americans will see rising prices, particularly at the gas pump.The move follows growing bipartisan pressure and pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, omitted in the initial sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine. Biden called the action a ""powerful blow"" against Russia's ability to fund its war against Ukraine, but warned, “Defending freedom is going to cost.”U.S. oil prices spiked to their highest levels since 2008 in anticipation of the announcement Monday, with crude in the U.S. hitting $130 a barrel. Gasoline prices were at the highest level ever Tuesday a gallon of regular was selling for an average of $4.17 and are forecasted to climb even higher.In response to the soaring oil prices, Exxon Mobil and Chevron say they are increasing their oil production from the Permian Basin field in West Texas and southeast New Mexico, Oklahoma Energy Today reported Tuesday.However, expect less-than-robust production from large independent Oklahoma oil companies like Continental Resources, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy, said Stuart MacDonald, director of Energy Land Management at the University of Texas Permian Basin. Small operators with five wells and financing from the local bank are “operating flat out,” he said, but major financial institutions and investors are showing a lot more restraint.“Those who advocate alternative energy have squeezed the financing and slowed down the money to the oil field. That makes it difficult to ramp production up,” MacDonald said.Devon Energy President and CEO Rick Muncrief said in October the company has “capped organic growth through the drill bit at 5%. We’re going to focus more on giving cash back to shareholders.”Investors who want a stock to guard against global uncertainty in light of the Russia-Ukraine war should look to Devon Energy, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Friday. “That’s your insurance policy against continued geopolitical chaos.”MacDonald said the nation’s best response to the invasion is to “start drilling and start exporting oil.” Russian President Vladimir Putin “can’t afford to do this at $50 a barrel.”The White House said the ban on new purchases was effective immediately but the administration was allowing a 45-day ""wind down"" for continued delivery under existing contracts.Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Cole and Frank Lucas of Oklahoma said the step was important to cut off funding to Putin.“While I am encouraged that the president announced the U.S. will finally stop buying Russian oil and energy products, this key sanction should have happened much sooner not because of pressure from Congress and public outrage, but because it is the right thing to do,” Cole said.“The world is a safer place when America is providing energy for the world. . The administration must not stifle American production with burdensome regulations or policies that penalize and curtail the supply of domestic energy,” Lucas said.State Sen. Mark Allen, R-Spiro, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said in addition to the ban Biden should take immediate action to reverse some of his energy policies “that have curtailed domestic energy production and contributed to increased costs for the American public.”Most of the U.S. oil imports come from Canada, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, but the amount of imported Russian oil has been increasing over the past few years, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. imported about 8% of its oil and refined products from Russia last year.While Russian oil makes up a small amount of overall energy imports, the U.S. could replace Russian crude with imports from other oil-rich nations, but that could prove politically problematic.Senior U.S officials traveled to Venezuela over the weekend in a bid to unfreeze hostile relations with Vladimir Putin’s top ally in Latin America, Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela is a top oil exporter whose reentry into U.S. energy markets could mitigate the fallout at the pump.""Putin's war is already hurting American families at the gas pump,"" Biden said Tuesday, adding, ""I'm going to do everything I can to minimize Putin's price hike here at home.""Key U.S. senators, however, are warning the Biden administration against seeking any oil import deal from the Maduro regime.Inflation is at a 40-year peak, fueled in large part by gas prices, and that could hurt Biden heading into the November midterm elections.""If gas is $5 (per gallon), it will impact the election,” MacDonald said. “If the result is more balance in Washington some Democrats will start to move back toward the middle.”That would ease policies affecting oil production.American Petroleum Institute on March 1 released new polling by Morning Consult that found 85% of American voters believe producing natural gas and oil in the U.S. could help lower energy costs for American consumers and small businesses, and 84% agree that producing natural gas and oil in the U.S. helps make the country and allies more secure against actions by other countries, such as Russia.The Associated Press contributed to this story."

| Jump to first hitIn what was described as a “breakout year” for Devon, the Oklahoma City-based energy corporation tripled its operating cash flow in 2021. Driven by production growth and margin expansion witnessed especially in assets in the Delaware Basin, free cash flow rose to the highest level reported in the company’s 50-year history, according to financial reports released this week.As a result of strong performance, Devon’s fourth-quarter dividend payout improved to a record high of $1 per share. The company’s board approved a 45% increase to its fixed quarterly dividend.“2021 was a breakout year for Devon that can best be defined by our bold strategic consolidation, unyielding commitment to capital discipline and the successful deployment of our industry-leading cash-return business model,” Devon President and CEO Rick Muncrief said in a statement. “With our powerful suite of assets and financially driven strategy, we delivered on exactly what we promised to do by generating a record-setting amount of free cash flow that was returned to shareholders through market-leading dividend payouts, opportunistic share buybacks, and improvements to our investment-grade financial strength.”In the fourth quarter of 2021, Devon reported net earnings of $1.5 billion, or $2.23 per diluted share. It identified core earnings as $935 million, or $1.39 per diluted share. Operating cash flow was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, a 173% increase from the first quarter of 2021, when Devon’s merger with WPX closed. The level of cash flow funded all capital requirements and resulted in $1.1 billion of free cash flow for the quarter.For the full-year 2021, operating cash flow totaled $4.9 billion, a more than threefold increase from 2020, and Devon generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow, it said.The company said it accelerated cash returns through execution of its share-repurchase program. In the fourth quarter, Devon repurchased 14 million shares at a total cost of $589 million. The board also expanded the company’s share-repurchase authorization by 60% to $1.6 billion, which is equivalent to 5% of Devon’s market capitalization.“In 2021, the company took steps to strengthen its financial position by retiring $1.2 billion of outstanding debt. At Dec. 31, 2021, the company had $2.3 billion of cash on hand and intends to further improve its balance sheet by retiring low-premium debt of up to $1.0 billion in 2022 and 2023,” the report stated.Operating results, plans for 2022Devon’s total production averaged 611,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter, exceeding guidance by 3%. Positive variance was across all products and driven by high-margin production growth in the Delaware Basin.The company’s fourth-quarter capital program averaged 16 operated drilling rigs and 4 completion crews, with over 80% of activity in the Delaware Basin. The benefits of an oil-weighted production mix, coupled with low operating costs, led to field-level cash margins expanding to $42.37 per Boe in the quarter. This result was a 14% improvement from the previous quarter, according to the report.In the Delaware Basin, production averaged 416,000 Boe per day. Volume growth in the quarter was driven by 65 new wells that achieved first production across Devon’s 400,000 net acre position in New Mexico and Texas. A key operating highlight in the fourth quarter was development of the Avalon Shale within Devon’s Cotton Draw leasehold in New Mexico. The grouping of six wells significantly exceeded pre-drill expectations, with average 30-day rates reaching up to 3,600 Boe per day.In 2022, Devon expects to operate an average of 14 rigs and bring online approximately 220 new wells in the Delaware Basin. Approximately 60% of activity will be directed toward development opportunities in New Mexico, with the remaining investment allocated to well-delineated opportunities across the company’s acreage in Texas.In the Anadarko Basin, production averaged 78,000 Boe per day, with gas and NGLs representing over 80% of the product mix. In 2021, Devon operated two drilling rigs in the basin. The company launched drilling of 31 wells, with 16 commencing first production during the year.In 2022, Devon plans to accelerate activity to a three-rig drilling program and bring online approximately 40 new wells across its acreage position.“As I look ahead, the value proposition of Devon only strengthens,” Muncrief said. “Our business is streamlined to capture the benefits of higher commodity prices and we will remain extremely disciplined by prioritizing value over the pursuit of volume. This shareholder-friendly approach will once again translate into differentiated cash returns and excellent returns on capital employed.”"

More than a dozen S&P 500 companies declared dividend increases this week as earnings season, typically a busy time for such announcements, rolls ahead. Estee Lauder Companies, Becton, Dickinson, and Simon Property Group were on the list.
Estee Lauder (ticker: EL), whose portfolio includes fragrances and skin-care products, said it would boost its quarterly payout to 60 cents a share, up 13% from 53 cents. The stock, which was recently yielding 0.7%, has returned about 28% this year through the close on Thursday, dividends included. That is a little ahead of the S&P 500's 26% return.
Medical technology company Becton, Dickinson (BDX) declared a quarterly dividend of 87 cents a share. That is an increase of about 5%, or 4 cents a share.
The stock, which has returned about minus 1% this year, yields 1.4%. This marks the 50th straight year in which the company has raised its dividend. It is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, whose members have paid out a higher dividend for at least 25 straight years.
Simon Property Group (SPG), a real estate investment trust focused on shopping malls and outlets, is planning to raise its dividend for the third time this year. Its board this week declared a quarterly disbursement of $1.65 a share, an increase of 10% from $1.50.
In June, the company said it would boost its quarterly dividend to $1.40 a share from $1.30. In August, management declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50.
The stock, which yields 3.9%, has returned about 100% this year, reflecting increasingly positive investor sentiment toward shopping malls and the economy's reopening following the pandemic.
Emerson Electric (EMR) said it plans to raise its dividend by a penny, or 2%, to 51.5 cents a share. The stock, which has returned about 23% this year, yields 2.1%. The company is also a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.
Devon Energy (DVN) declared a quarterly dividend of 84 cents a share , up sharply from 49 cents a share previously. The increase reflects higher oil prices and improved conditions in the energy business.
The company's board also authorized a $1 billion share- repurchase program through the end of 2022—a total equal to about 4% of the company's market capitalization. Devon Energy has a fixed dividend with variable additional payouts that hinge on business conditions.
In the previous quarter, the fixed dividend was 11 cents a share, while the variable one was 38 cents, for a total of 49 cents. The stock, which has returned about 180% this year, yields 2.9%.
Pharmaceutical drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (ABC) plans to increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents a share, to 46 cents, an increase of 4.5%.
The stock, which yields 1.4%, has returned about 31% year to date.
In other news, apparel company PVH (PVH) said that its board's executive committee on Oct. 29 declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 3.75 cents a share on the common stock.
The dividend was suspended last year due to the pandemic. The stock has returned about 27% this year.
The company's brands include Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.

| Jump to first hitWhen the price of oil passed $60 per barrel and kept rising, Tom Seng was stunned that he didn’t see a comparable increase in drilling activity.Three years ago, when prices averaged $65, oil and gas producers were borrowing money against reserves in the ground and aggressively going after them.“It was drill, baby, drill,” said Seng, director of the School of Energy Economics, Policy and Commerce at the University of Tulsa.Today, Oklahoma producers are showing a lot more restraint, reflecting a change in sentiment among investors at a time when global oil production and prices are booming, experts told The Journal Record. The modest approach to new drilling could have long-term implications on Oklahoma's energy industry, those experts said.U.S. oil prices finished above $80 per barrel for the first time in nearly seven years on Oct. 11. The last time that happened was Oct. 31, 2014.Baker Hughes reports 43 rotary rigs currently are operating in Oklahoma. By comparison, the Oklahoma rig count in October 2014 was 208.“We’ve gone from one extreme to another,” Seng said. “I think this is a long-term change for publicly traded companies. Shareholders won. They don’t want to go back to the old ways.”Finance expert Debbie Fleming agrees.“After the shock of pandemic pricing and the lasting impacts of strong shareholder activism on the culture of most energy companies, there is a measured response rather than an all-out race to drill,” said Fleming, executive in residence for energy programs at Oklahoma City University’s Meinders School of Business.“The rig count is significantly higher than last year, but month-to-month increases have been steady, not dramatic,” she said. “Cash flow and consistent results are absolutely the most important measures of success now and investors have little appetite for risk.”Rather than acquiring more debt while prices are high, investors want producers to pay down debt and pay dividends, Seng said.Oil production in Oklahoma was down 20% in July from the same month one year ago at the same time demand was going up. “The industry has never been this disciplined,” he said.“We’ve learned that investors are no longer interested in having us burn through capital at their expense,” Devon Energy President and CEO Rick Muncrief said. “So we’ve capped organic growth through the drill bit at 5%. We’re going to focus more on giving cash back to shareholders.“In addition to a fixed dividend that we’ve paid for 28 years, we’re also now paying a variable dividend. We were the first company to implement one and we did it earlier this year,” Muncrief said. “It’s a cash-return model. It’s something investors had been asking for, for quite some time, and we’re pleased to be the first to implement it.”Fleming said the increase in rigs in the Permian Basin andOklahoma plays highlight how companies are primarily focused on areas with known reserves. “However, with the current pricing and demand for natural gas, it’s a safe bet the gas-focused rig count will increase,” she said.Capitol Hill connectionBrook Simmons, president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, said clearly there is a broad-based recovery in the oil and gas industry in OklahomaData from the most recent Oklahoma Energy Index show every index component except for crude oil spot price has moved higher from one month ago. Rig activity is climbing and is taking employment along with it, the OEI shows. Natural gas prices have spiked as market conditions, especially in Europe, remain very tight.Simmons warned the recovery is still fragile due to supply chain challenges, inflation, more competition for capital and federal policies that could be harmful.“The immediate future of the state’s defining industry could be determined on Capitol Hill,” he said. “In Washington, D.C., lawmakers are currently debating an infrastructure and social spending plan that is touted by the Biden administration as a transformative economic stimulus.”Proposals include significant tax increases on the oil and natural gas industry to fund alternative energy investments.“The extent to which the spending package is a net economic stimulant depends on both the size of the bill and the composition of tax policies adopted to finance it,” Simmons said. “If the goals of the Biden administration are met, the increased taxes on the oil and natural gas industry in the form of methane taxes and carbon taxes could have a chilling effect on Oklahoma’s oil and gas industry and the state’s economy as a whole.”The government could create an artificial scarcity of oil and gas by imposing regulations and fees and canceling pipelines, resulting in hesitancy to get back to full activity, he said.The high crude prices have pushed prices at the pump to the highest in seven years. AAA reported Friday the average price of gasoline nationwide was $3.306 per gallon, up from $2.178 one year ago. GasBuddy reported the cheapest price for regular in Oklahoma City on Friday was $2.64 at CM Food Mart, 6201 NW 10th St.Oilprice.com noted Oct. 14 that high prices at the pump are notorious as a voting preference factor, so Democrats preparing for next year's midterm need to act fast to lower prices.After the Biden administration called on other oil-exporting nations to bring more oil to the market to no avail, the president decided to reach out to an industry against which much of his political agenda is directed, Politico reported.""Senior staff is preoccupied with trying to identify options to bring down oil prices, which they believe are driving (the) inflation uptick,"" Stephen Brown, energy lobbyist and strategist with RBJ Strategies, told Politico. ""Some producers will talk to them, but it is also not like they have a lot of friends in this sector.""Being in the gameLarge independent Oklahoma oil companies like Continental Resources, Devon Energy and Chesapeake Energy are not picking up as rapidly as would be expected, said Stuart MacDonald, director of Energy Land Management at the University of Texas Permian Basin.The less-than-robust return to drilling activity stemming from various factors doesn’t signal a sea change in the industry, MacDonald said.When something as complex as the oil and gas industry shuts down, it takes a while to start it back up, he said.Other factors are the increasing difficulty in getting oil and gas financing and the psychological effect of being “kicked in the teeth” and told how horrible people in the fossil fuel business are, MacDonald said. “It saps somebody’s will and spirit.”Exploration and production are going through a transition and big companies like Exxon, Chevron and Shell may move to more downstream operations to appease important government relationships, he said.MacDonald predicts E&P will shift to more private equity financing and fewer firms will go public, but oil and gas production is not going away.“Modern industrial countries cannot function without fossil fuel,” he said.“People in the industry it’s about being in the game, being a part of it,” MacDonald said. “There’s too much money in the ground and they won’t leave it.”"

| Jump to first hitDevon Energy Corporation, an Oklahoma-based oil and natural gas exploration and production company, and its affiliates, Devon Energy Corp. (Oklahoma) and Devon Energy Production Company LP (collectively, Devon), have agreed to pay $6.15 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by underpaying and underreporting royalties for natural gas from federal lands in Wyoming and New Mexico.The United States leases federal lands for the production of natural gas in exchange for the payment of royalties on the value of the gas produced. Lessees must put the gas in marketable condition at no cost to the United States. The settlement resolves allegations that, in calculating royalties, Devon improperly deducted payments to third-parties for gas transportation and processing that included costs to place the gas in marketable condition, and thereby knowingly underreported and underpaid royalties to the Department of the Interior (DOI). The United States allows companies to remove gas from federal lands, which belong to all of us, in exchange for the payment of appropriate royalties, said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton of the Justice Department's Civil Division. This settlement demonstrates that the government will hold accountable those who take improper advantage of public resources.We hold our public lands very dear in Colorado, said Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew T. Kirsch for the District of Colorado. We will not allow companies extracting natural resources from those lands to avoid paying what they rightfully owe.The Office of the Inspector General is committed to working with our partners at the Department of Justice, Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Office of the Solicitor to ensure that companies producing minerals from areas under Federal jurisdiction fulfill their legal and professional responsibilities, said Special Agent in Charge Ron Gonzales for the DOI Office of Inspector General's Energy Investigations Unit.The resolution in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department's Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section and the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado, with the assistance of DOI's Office of the Inspector General-Energy Investigations Unit, DOI's Office of the Solicitor, and DOI's Office of Natural Resources Revenue. The matter was investigated by Senior Trial Counsel Gregory Pearson and Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Rocque of the District of Colorado. The claims resolved by the settlement are allegations only and there has been no determination of liability.Source: U.S. Department of Justice"

After years of outspending their cash production, oil companies are now living within their means. Many are generating enough cash flow to cover their debt, dividends, and production budgets with room to spare. It doesn't hurt that oil and gas prices have rebounded and are trading at multiyear highs .
Investors have been rewarding companies that are doing a particularly good job of pumping out free cash flow and increasing their shareholder returns.
Barron's screened for the companies that are expected to increase their free cash flow the most in the next quarter from the last quarter. We looked at energy companies with market caps over $5 billion in the S&P 1500. The six top performers were Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Range Resources (RRC), EOG Resources(EOG), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), Devon Energy (DVN), and Cimarex Energy (XEC).
Natural gas prices have jumped to seven-year highs above $5 a million British thermal units, or BTUs. Gas inventories have been running low, as some companies have cut back on production and demand improves. On Monday, prices were up 7.7%. The upswing has lifted several natural gas producers . Cabot Oil & Gas, which is based in Houston but produces mostly in Appalachia, is expected to pump out significantly more free cash flow in the current quarter than it did in the prior one. Its stock has shot 40% higher in the past month.
For natural gas companies, their ability to benefit from price increases depends on whether they had previously hedged their production at lower prices. Those that hedge less production will be able to turn more of that price increase into cash. As of February, Cabot had hedged a little less than half of its 2021 production. But it had not hedged its 2022 production as of the end of the second quarter. Cabot CEO Dan Dinges said on the company's latest earnings call that it might do so before the end of the year, though investors are unlikely to know the extent of those hedges until the company's next earnings call.
Range Resources, another natural gas producer that extracts gas in Appalachia, has benefited from the price increase, with its stock rising 44% in a month. Range had already hedged some of its 2022 production, but had also left some unhedged to get the benefit of higher prices.
Oil prices have also been on the upswing lately, and U.S. producers are seeing major benefits. Among those are EOG, Pioneer Natural Resources, Devon Energy, and Cimarex Energy. All of those companies have participated in mergers, acquisitions, or land deals over the past year, bolstering their positions as the oil-and-gas industry consolidates. (EOG has not made any big deals, but has done some smaller acquisitions.) Most of those deals were stock transactions, meaning the companies did not add debt. Their hope is that they can add to production without also adding leverage — which has been a problem in the past.
Two companies on this list may soon become one. Cimarex plans to merge with Cabot in an all-stock deal that shareholders are expected to vote on this week.

| Jump to first hitTwo university professors with ties to Oklahoma and Devon Energy are researching ways to potentially better safeguard the environment and save companies substantial money through early detection of oil and gas leaks.University of Oklahoma physics and astronomy associate professor Alberto Marino and Jyotsna Sharma, the Devon Energy career development professor at Louisiana State University, are conducting research into how “quantum-enhanced fiber sensing” could be employed to detect petroleum leaks before human or animal lives or the environment might be harmed. Their research was funded through a $750,000 grant from the Department of Energy.“A major area of concern in the oil and gas industry is preventing environmental contamination caused by subsurface leaks due to well integrity issues and surface spillage through the millions of miles of surface, underground, and subsea pipelines that accrue over years,” Sharma said. “This spillage causes ecological damage, human casualties, and economic loss.”Current commercial techniques for leakage detection are limited by environmental and background noise and don’t offer enough sensitivity to detect small leaks. Such noises include pump- and fluid-handling noise and waves in offshore operations.“We will use quantum states of light to enhance the sensitivity of fiber-optic leakage sensors,” Sharma said. “We believe that the recent developments in quantum information science can lead to a paradigm shift in the field with the potential for a large impact for oil and gas applications through improvements in monitoring technology for earlier identification and warning.”Sharma, who is co-principal investigator on the project, and Marino, the principal investigator, are working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory on the three-year project. After performing initial lab tests, the team will test developed quantum techniques under real-life, high-pressure conditions in a 5,000-foot-deep test well instrumented with fiber-optic sensors."

Stocks dropped on Friday as the market continues to adjust to a more hawkish Federal Reserve . The latest policy maker comments on Friday reinforced the narrative of a reflation trade in trouble. That meant losses for value stocks and commodities and a rising U.S. dollar.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 533 points, or 1.6%, on Friday, while the S&P 500 declined 1.3% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.9%. The Dow's 3.4% loss for the week was its biggest decline since the last week of October 2020, right before the presidential election.
 Speaking on CNBC on Friday morning, St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard acknowledged that the central bank has been surprised about the quick recovery in inflation and that policy will get tighter sooner as a result. He said that he could see an interest-rate increase as soon as next year and that discussion about tapering, or reducing the size of the Fed's monthly bond purchases, had begun.
""[The market] has held up pretty well, but the more comments we get like this, the worse it could get over the coming days,"" writes Evercore ISI strategist Dennis DeBusschere. ""He seems pretty clear that tighter financial conditions are coming.""
Bullard isn't currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, but will rotate into a voting seat next year. His comments came after the Fed didn't change its policy stance at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, but did signal a shift in its thinking. Officials' Summary of Economic Projections, or the so-called ""dot plot,"" showed that the median FOMC member now expects two rate increases in 2023 , enough to demonstrate a hawkish lean to the committee. The previous dot plot in March had no hikes until 2024.
That increasingly hawkish tilt has caused stocks that benefit from a stronger economy and hotter inflation—the financials, energy, and materials sectors among them—to get hit hard, and has sparked a resurgence in the tech trade. Growthier tech stocks again beat cyclical and value stocks on Friday.
S&P 500 financials closed down 2.4% and energy stocks lost 3%. Tech stocks, meanwhile, slipped 1%. All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 finished in the red on Friday.
Some of those movements may be about making up for past underperformance by tech stocks. ""The fear of a more hawkish Fed and rates rising sooner we believe has been a 10%+ overhang on tech stocks this year as multiples compressed and we saw a curtailing of risk assets led by tech and EV stocks,"" says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
It wasn't a great day for the dividend-paying utilities and consumer staples sectors either, which lost 2.7% and 1.8%, respectively. Higher interest rates and bond yields make those stocks' payouts less attractive by comparison.
Other asset classes were also reflecting an anti-reflation trade dynamic on Friday. The U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the price of the greenback against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.5% after surging on Thursday. Copper, gold, and iron ore prices fell, while oil partially rebounded from Thursday's loss. Gold had suffered its worst one-day percentage loss of the year and settled at the lowest level in close to seven weeks on Thursday.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, meanwhile, ticked down 0.06 percentage point to 1.45%, while the 2-year Treasury note yield rose nearly 0.05 percentage point, to 0.26%. That's a so-called ""bear flattener"" in the Treasury yield curve, which implies relatively weaker economic growth in the future. It's also tough on banks, whose bread-and-butter business is to borrow short to lend long. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) closed down 3.3% on Friday.
There were a handful of technical curveballs likely impacting the market as well. The once-quarterly simultaneous expiration of options and futures on single stocks and indexes is Friday, known as quadruple witching day . The annual rebalancing of FTSE Russell's indexes takes place after the close next Friday. And the second quarter ends in less than two weeks. Fund managers, index funds, and institutional investors all tend to adjust their portfolios around those types of events, adding some volatility and buying or selling pressure to pockets of the market.
Overseas stock action on Friday was a mixed bag. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.2%. The Stoxx Europe 600 index and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 both lost 1.6%, dragged down by banks and energy shares.
These stocks were making moves on Friday:
Lennar (LEN) gained 3.7% after getting upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at JPMorgan.
Cimarex Energy (XEC), EQT (EQT), and Devon Energy (DVN) fell 1.5%, 5.6%, and 3.0%, respectively, after getting downgraded to Equal Weight from Overweight at Morgan Stanley.
Biogen (BIIB) closed up 1.3% after getting upgraded to Overweight from Neutral at Piper Sander.
Adobe (ADBE) gained 2.6% after reporting a profit of $3.03 a share, beating forecasts for $2.81 .
23andMe Holding (ME) stock dropped 5.5% following the closing of its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which took the genetic testing company public.

Developments in the past couple of weeks showed that the two American supermajors—Exxon Mobil and Chevron—can no longer kick the can down the road when it comes to addressing climate risk. While the heat is on the oil giants, though, their market share won't exactly be easy pickings for other producers.
On May 26, the two largest U.S. descendants of Rockefeller's Standard Oil empire both had a reckoning of sorts . Exxon lost director seats to nominees put forth by the sustainability-focused activist investor Engine No. 1, an upstart fund with a fraction of its shares. On the same day, another activist group successfully persuaded the majority of Chevron's shareholders to demand more emissions cuts.
Since then, both Exxon's and Chevron's shares have gained about 5% on the back of higher crude prices, but they lagged behind producers not affected by activist-related headlines. Devon Energy and Occidental Petroleum have both gained at least 15%, while ConocoPhillips and EOG Resources gained close to 10%.
That might be in part driven by an expectation that the limits placed on the industry's giants will lead to market-share gains for others. Scrutiny of Exxon and Chevron will almost certainly place a higher hurdle on their future investments. In some cases, it might lead to divestments if certain assets don't meet return hurdles or emissions targets.
In theory, independent exploration and production companies are in a solid position to step in. Many of them have proven to have better well performance and productivity compared with supermajors in previous years, according to Scott Hanold, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. That is in part because the independent E&P companies tend to focus primarily on oil and gas production and are optimized for it; major oil companies have a more sprawling business model that includes hydrocarbon transportation, refining and petrochemicals. The concentrated business model of independent E&Ps could, in some cases, shield them from investor pressure to stifle new production. After all, there is only so much shrinking a pure-play oil producer can tolerate; without new wells, their revenue sources dry up quickly.
It won't be easy for those independent E&Ps to seize the moment, though. The recent sustainability pressure comes from investors with a keen eye on the bottom line. They want to do well by doing good, and they haven't been pleased with Exxon's performance in particular. Yet independent E&P companies' record has been less than stellar in recent years. That alone will make it difficult for those companies to start a spending spree.
Five-year average returns on invested capital as of 2019 were lower for many independent E&P companies compared with Exxon and Chevron, including ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Devon Energy, EQT and Occidental Petroleum. Those firms also lack the distinct advantage of being completely integrated with cash flows that can provide a buffer when oil and natural gas prices are low.
And the activists might show up at their doors, too. Earlier in May, Follow This, the investor behind the push to reduce Chevron's emissions, successfully put forth resolutions at ConocoPhillips to set concrete emissions targets. So it seems as though companies large enough to capitalize on the supermajors' slowdown will find it tough to step in. Smaller companies—especially those in private-equity hands and immune to such pressure—could be the ultimate beneficiaries, but it will take a lot longer for them to start making a dent in the larger peers' market share.
Investors who pivot too quickly to smaller producers to escape the heat could end up with a hot potato on their hands.

When Cimarex Energy and Cabot Oil & Gas recently unveiled their plan to merge in an all-stock deal, one of the selling points was the dividend.
But it's not expected to be a traditional payout.
Instead, the combined entity will aim to offer ""a sustainable base dividend that is positioned to grow over time and a variable dividend and a special dividend,"" Cimarex Energy CEO Thomas E. Jorden told analysts late last month.
Variable dividends, more common in Europe, are still rare in the U.S. But the concept, at least, has gained some traction, helped by a slew of dividend cuts and suspensions across the oil patch and other sectors, owing to the pandemic's onset last year.
A handful of energy companies have switched to this model, which typically uses a fixed base dividend and, depending on cash flow, a variable one as well. An important idea behind it is to give companies more flexibility with their payouts, especially in tougher parts of the economic and business cycle.
Income Investing
Besides the plans outlined by Cimarex Energy (ticker: XEC) and Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), base/variable dividend adopters include Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN).
""The leaders in the industry who get it understand what shareholders are really looking for,"" says Mike Liss, a co-manager at the American Century Equity Income Fund (TWEIX), adding that the ""opportunity is there to return cash to shareholders.""
Liss expects that ""more companies will continue to move in that direction because they've been rewarded by the market.""
The market has certainly rewarded Devon Energy, an exploration-and-production company based in Oklahoma City. Its shares have returned nearly 100% in 2021, dividends included. Devon recently declared a quarterly disbursement of 34 cents a share, up 13% from 30 cents. That consists of a fixed payout of 11 cents a share and a variable one of 23 cents.
""They are able to return a lot of cash to shareholders right now at what is becoming a really good point in the cycle for them,"" says Jim Covello, co-head of single-name research at Goldman Sachs and a proponent of variable dividends. ""But they are doing it in a way that's not going to constrain their balance sheet and cash flow in a less robust part of the cycle.""
Brent crude was recently around $71 a barrel, up from the high $30s last fall, according to FactSet.
Meanwhile, Pioneer Natural Resources has risen about 47% this year, versus around 44% for the energy stocks in the S&P 500. Cimarex has returned about 90%. Yet not all of these stocks have been outperformers, as shares of Cabot Oil & Gas have gained only 6%, including dividends.
Why haven't more companies—and other sectors—switched to a variable dividend policy?
""We've had a lot of calls with companies in other sectors,"" says Covello. ""But energy is definitely where you've seen it implemented.""
Yet he expects the concept to catch on in more sectors. ""Once a couple of companies start to do it and get rewarded for it, it's something you're going to see more widely adopted,"" he says.
Another selling point for variable dividend payers, Covello says, will be ""if those same companies outperform in a downturn."" Under such a scenario, he adds, their balance sheets would come under less pressure, owing to a payout that ""naturally comes down.""
Until those variables play out, however, variable dividends aren't likely to emerge en masse.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY As Devon Energy Corp. begins its second half-century, the goal is “just keep running a good business the right way,” President and CEO Rick Muncrief said.“Looking back at Devon’s last 50 years gives us a lot to be proud of,” Muncrief said in an exclusive interview with The Journal Record. “Devon is a great company, and we intend to build on our past successes to carry on its legacy into the future.”The oil and gas industry has faced great challenges in the past eight years, but Devon has endured and prospered and will continue to do so, he said.Founded by John and Larry Nichols in 1971, the company started with no assets and five employees, but by 1988 was publicly traded and then listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Devon continued to grow organically and by acquisition and joined the S&P 500 in 2000.In 2014, the company had 62,000 employees around the world. Today it operates with 1,600 people in five U.S. basins: Anadarko, Delaware, Eagle Ford, Powder River and Williston.Devon and WPX Energy merged in January 2021, keeping Devon’s name and headquarters in Oklahoma City. WPX’s Muncrief became president and CEO of Devon, and Devon’s Dave Hager became executive chairman of the company’s board of directors.“Both companies were doing OK, but we were not being appreciated in the market,” Muncrief said. “Putting the two together has strengthened the company.”Other key leaders from WPX who have moved into the 50-story corporate headquarters in downtown Oklahoma City are Clay Gaspar, chief operating officer, and Dennis Cameron, general counsel.The Devon Energy Center is at 40% occupancy now, Muncrief said, and the company is open to third-party tenants.Oil prices which dipped to $20 to $30 a barrel last year are now in a much healthier range, he said. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil was nearly $66 on Monday.With that, Devon has done more than return to business as usual, Muncrief said.The company has paid down debt several years in advance and implemented an industry-first variable dividend in addition to its fixed dividend. “We were the first to do that and the market has really loved it,” Muncrief said.He said the company also is committed to find and produce oil and natural gas in ways that are safe, ethical, and environmentally and socially responsible. A working group is studying what new technologies can be implemented around and adjacent to base operations.“We want Devon to be positioned to be successful irrespective of who’s in the White House (and Congress) be open-minded and look for opportunities to be creative and innovative in the headwinds,” Muncrief said.Devon’s historic achievements include being the first to successfully combine horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing in the Barnett Shale of North Texas, which launched the shale revolution that spread to oil and gas-producing regions across the U.S.“When we started, the vision was to build a U.S. oil and gas powerhouse,” said Devon co-founder Larry Nichols. “We were always looking for new technologies and modern ways to produce oil and gas because we wanted to be innovators. I’m proud to say that I think that’s exactly what Devon has been in the industry over the years.”Muncrief said the company remains committed to that.One challenge in 2021 is to communicate to the public and investors how critical the industry is to “providing not just today’s energy, but tomorrow’s energy,” he said. “We have to have oil and natural gas.”Hydrocarbons will be an essential component of the energy mix for decades to come, he said.The industry can be taken for granted until something like the shutdown of Colonial Pipeline following a ransomware attack in early May caused shortage along the East Coast. The company delivers 100 million gallons of fuel a day.It would take 16,000 to 17,000 trucks running 24/7 to haul the same amount of fuel, if you could find the drivers and the highways could withstand the wear and tear, Muncrief said.“We have our energy independence,” he said. “We have to stay involved and lobby hard for the value.”"

Adjusting for the downtime, Devon reported that it expects oil production in the first quarter of 261,000 to 265,000 barrels per day and total production of 485,000 to 499,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.The company’s guidance excluded WPX results prior to its acquisition close date of Jan. 7, 2021, limiting production by an incremental 3% for the first quarter.“I would like to personally thank the team for their hard work and dedication preparing for and safely responding to the unprecedented severe weather conditions,” Devon President and Chief Executive Rick Muncrief said in the release. “With our operations fully restored to pre-storm levels, we are well positioned to execute on our disciplined capital plan, accelerate free cash flow generation and return increasing amounts of cash to shareholders.”Per-unit expenses are expected to increase by approximately 5% in the first quarter as a result of the weather effects.The company’s full-year 2021 guidance was also adjusted for the sale of the company’s Wind River asset in Wyoming, which closed on March 3. This divesture is expected to reduce oil production by approximately 2,000 barrels per day for the full year.Additional details of Devon’s forward-looking guidance for the first quarter and full-year 2021 are available on the company’s website at www.devonenergy.com.The company announced on Tuesday it will report first quarter 2021 financial results after the close of U.S. financial markets on May 4.

The stock market is closed for Presidents Day on Monday . Forty-eight S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report during the rest of the week.
CVS Health, Devon Energy, Occidental Petroleum, Palantir Technologies, and Vornado Realty Trust will be Tuesday's highlights, followed by Analog Devices, Baidu, Hilton Worldwide Holdings, and Shopify on Wednesday. Applied Materials, Marriott International, Newmont, Roku, and Walmart report on Thursday. Finally, Deere closes out the week on Friday.
The economic-data calendar this week includes Wednesday's January retail sales from the Census Bureau. Forecasts are for a 1.3% rise from December, when consumer spending slipped 0.7%. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reports the producer price index for January on Wednesday. On average, economists expect a 0.4% month-over-month rise, or 0.2% when excluding volatile food and energy components.
Also Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will release the minutes from its late-January meeting. And on Friday, IHS Markit will publish its Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers' indexes for February.
Monday 2/15

Oil and gas companies could face more stringent regulations under Democratic control of the White House and Congress. But analysts remain confident about their prospects, as political shifts often result in surprising changes.
In fact, President-elect Joe Biden's victory has
coincided with a runup in prices
even though he is considered to be less of a friend to the industry than a Republican administration would have been.
Truist analyst Neal Dingmann found six stocks he calls ""Democrat Darlings"" that could do especially well in the next year—both because they can handle any new regulatory requirements, and because their core businesses are set up well to generate cash in the current environment.
His favorite stocks for the coming political shift include several stocks whose free cash flow is likely to grow considerably at higher oil prices. They also tend to have relatively low debt. These ""Democrat Darlings"" include Apache (ticker: APA), Devon Energy (DVN), Diamondback Energy (FANG), EOG Resources (EOG), Marathon Oil (MRO), and Penn Virginia (PVAC).
Dingmann wrote that the most likely changes to come out of Congress and the Biden White House are
limits on drilling on federal land and tax increases
. Biden has said he wants to raise corporate taxes, reversing about half of the cuts that President Trump and Republicans made in 2017.
Democrats could also change tax rules targeted at oil and gas names, including amending a break that allows companies to deduct most of the cost of drilling new wells, known as intangible drilling costs. Biden could delay or stop new pipelines as well, after the Trump administration had eased their regulatory path.
For oil companies, several of those changes could pinch profits and future growth. But Dingmann noted that most oil and gas companies did so poorly in the last few years that they'll be able to carry forward considerable net operating losses, and potentially pay ""little cash taxes in the coming years,"" he wrote.
Biden has also called for an end to new permits on federal land. In anticipation, producers filed permits for new leases in a rush last year, with nearly 3,800 being approved in the second half of the year, Dingmann noted. Those permits tend to last for several years, so the companies could be insulated from changes in the near term. EOG, for example, has high exposure to federal land, but got 620 federal permit approvals in the second half of last year, the most of any operator. The fourth quarter permit haul was the largest of the Trump years, he wrote.
EOG shares were up 2.4% around midday Thursday, while the S&P 500 was up 0.2%. Apache stock gained 4.9%, Devon shares advanced 6.2%, Diamondback rose 2.2%, Marathon Oil rallied 8.3%, and Penn Virginia gained 3.1%.

It's another holiday-shortened week, with stock and bond markets around the world shut on Friday for New Year's Day. Fixed-income exchanges will also close early on Thursday.
There are no major companies releasing earnings this week, but a pair of mergers and acquisitions come before shareholders for a vote—both on Tuesday. Tiffany stockholders will weigh in on the jeweler's proposed acquisition by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. Meanwhile, Devon Energy and WPX Energy will both hold special shareholder meetings to seek approval for their proposed merger.
The economic calendar this week is busier. Several housing market indicators are out: S&P CoreLogic releases its Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index for October on Tuesday, followed by the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index for November and the Mortgage Bankers Association's Market Composite Index for the latest week, both on Wednesday.
Other data out this week include the Census Bureau's international trade balance in goods for November on Wednesday and the Department of Labor's initial jobless claims numbers for the week ending on Dec. 26 on Thursday.
Monday 12/28
The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas releases its Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey for December. Consensus estimate is for an 11 reading, similar to the November figure. The index has rebounded sharply from a record low set in April and stands at its highest since late 2018.
Tuesday 12/29
S&P CoreLogic releases its Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index for October. Economists forecast a 7% year-over-year increase, matching the September data. That figure is the highest for the index since May of 2014, as the housing market continues to be a bright spot for the economy.
Wednesday 12/30
The Institute for Supply Management releases its Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for December. Expectations are for a 56.8 reading, a decrease from November's 58.2.
Tiffany holds a virtual special shareholders meeting to vote on a proposed merger with LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. LVMH initially agreed to buy Tiffany in an all-cash transaction for $135 a share 13 months ago in a deal valued at $16 billion. Due in part to shutdowns caused by the pandemic, the price was renegotiated down to $131.50 a share in October, saving LVMH $430 million.
The National Association of Realtors releases its Pending Home Sales Index for November. Expectations are for a flat reading, month over month. The index fell by 1% in September and October after posting strong gains in the summer. The index currently stands just below its all-time peak set earlier this August.
Devon Energy and WPX Energy hold special shareholder meetings to seek approval for their proposed all-stock merger of equals first announced in late September. Under the terms of the deal, Devon shareholders would own about 57% of the combined entity, which would have an enterprise value of roughly $16 billion.
The Census Bureau reports the international trade balance in goods for November. It's expected to come in at about an $80 billion deficit, similar to the past four months. The trade deficit in goods hit a record monthly high of $83.9 billion in August.
The Mortgage Bankers Association releases its Market Composite Index, which tracks mortgage-loan application volume, for the week ending on Dec. 25. The index is up strongly year over year, as the 30-year fixed rate is a full percentage point lower than a year ago, at a recent 2.86%.
Thursday 12/31
Fixed-income markets close early at 2 p.m. EST for New Year's Eve. However, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq keep regular trading hours.
The Department of Labor reports initial jobless claims for the week ending on Dec. 26. Jobless claims have increased in December, averaging 852,000 a week, as Covid-19 cases have spiked in parts of the country. Until December, claims had fallen every month since April, averaging 740,500 a week in November, down from the April peak of more than five million a week.
Friday 1/1
Stock and bond markets are closed in observance of New Year's Day.

| Jump to first hitTULSA WPX Energy reported a loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter of $148 million, or 26 cents per diluted share.The loss was primarily from a $110 million net loss on derivatives resulting from non-cash forward mark-to-market changes in the company’s hedge book, and a loss on the extinguishment of debt.As underlying forward commodity prices improved in the quarter, the value of hedging contracts was reduced from levels recorded at June 30.Excluding the forward mark-to-market changes in derivatives and other items, WPX posted adjusted net income from continuing operations in the third quarter of $60 million, 11 cents per share.The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 6 cents per share.Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and exploration, or EBITDAX, for the third quarter totaled $389 million, up 8% from $361 million a year earlier.On Sept. 28, Tulsa-based WPX and Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy announced an agreement to combine in an all-stock merger of equals, making the combined entity the fifth-largest independent oil producer in the country.“Our proposed merger is on track and is proving to be a transformational event not only for our two companies, but for our industry as a whole based on events that have unfolded since our announcement,” said Rick Muncrief, WPX’s chairman and CEO.“Consolidation is a strategic step that reduces costs, improves margins and accelerates the return of capital to shareholders in very meaningful ways, Muncrief said.Integration plans are underway, led by a transition team comprised of senior leaders from each company. Additionally, the team is tasked with capitalizing on the synergies and operational efficiencies that contribute to the significant upside of the combined company.The combination of WPX and Devon will benefit from a premier multi-basin portfolio, headlined by a premium acreage position in the economic core of the Delaware Basin.Under the terms of the agreement, WPX shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.5165 shares of Devon common stock for each share of WPX common stock owned. Devon shareholders will own 57% of the combined company and WPX shareholders will own 43%.The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies.“WPX has been a leader in our peer group, and the combined company will provide us with even more strength and capacity to deliver value through disciplined management and an unwavering focus on profitable, per-share growth,” Muncrief said.WPX Energy reported third-quarter oil volumes of 122,300 barrels per day, in line with second-quarter results as expected stemming from the effects of prior curtailments and reduced development activity.WPX released all four of its completion crews during the second quarter in response to the COVID-19 effect on oil demand and commodity prices. WPX now has two crews deployed in the Delaware Basin and one in the Williston Basin after starting to resume completions in July.WPX completed 13 Delaware wells during the third quarter and 16 Williston wells, including nine wells in the Three Forks formation and seven wells in the Bakken formation.

The average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for a loss of 8 cents per share.In the third quarter, Oklahoma City-based Devon’s operating cash flow from continuing operations totaled $427 million, funding all capital requirements and generating $223 million of free cash flow in the quarter.Devon exited the third quarter with $1.9 billion of cash and an undrawn credit facility of $3 billion. At the end of the quarter, the company had an outstanding debt balance of $4.3 billion with no debt maturities occurring until late 2025.Oil and gas sales for the third quarter totaled $678 million, down from $919 million a year earlier. Marketing and midstream revenue for the third quarter totaled $476 million, down from $700 million.“Devon is executing at a very high level on all aspects of our disciplined cash-return business model,” said Dave Hager, president and CEO. “Our third-quarter performance was highlighted by record-setting well productivity and capital efficiency gains in the Delaware Basin that drove oil production well above guidance with a total capital investment that was below forecast. Furthermore, this strong operational performance, coupled with significant improvements in our corporate cost structure, positioned us to generate $223 million of free cash flow in the quarter.”On Oct. 1, Devon completed the sale of its Barnett Shale assets. The company received a cash payment of $320 million at closing, after adjusting for a $170 million deposit received in April and other purchase-price adjustments.“With our operations successfully scaled to generate free cash flow, our advantaged financial position allows us to accelerate the return of capital to shareholders,” Hager said. “In conjunction with the recent closing of the Barnett Shale divestiture, we rewarded our shareholders with a $100 million special dividend. This action further demonstrates our commitment to the cash return business model, which moderates growth, emphasizes capital efficiencies, prioritizes free cash flow and returns increasing amounts of cash to shareholders.”Net production from Devon’s retained assets averaged 326,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day during the third quarter. Oil production averaged 146,000 barrels per day, exceeding the company’s midpoint guidance by 6,000 barrels per day. Third-quarter oil production benefited from strong well productivity in the Delaware Basin and better-than-expected base production performance across the portfolio.Upstream capital spending in the third quarter was $195 million, or 3% below midpoint guidance. This positive variance was attributable to efficiency gains in the Delaware Basin and improvements in service-cost pricing. Devon averaged nine operated drilling rigs and three completion crews in the third quarter, all in the Delaware Basin.Devon’s production expense totaled $271 million in the third quarter, an 8% improvement year from a year earlier. The largest component of production expense is lease operating expense and gathering, processing and transportation costs, which totaled $225 million, or $7.49 per Boe, in the quarter. Effective cost management efforts and efficient field-level operations drove per-unit rates 8% below guidance expectations for the quarter.General and administrative expenses for the third quarter totaled $75 million in the third quarter, a 30% improvement from the third quarter of 2019. The lower overhead costs were primarily driven by reduced personnel expense.For the second consecutive quarter, Devon increased its full-year oil production forecast to a range of 152,000 to 154,000 barrels per day. The improved outlook is due to better-than-expected well productivity and strong base production performance across its asset portfolio.In the fourth quarter, Devon expects oil production to average 148,000 to 153,000 barrels per day, a 7,000-barrel-per-day improvement from prior guidance expectations.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy Corp. on Monday released its 2020 Sustainability Report which highlights the company’s performance and efforts related to emissions and flaring reductions, environment preservation, pandemic and crisis management, employee empowerment and community investment.“At Devon we are providing energy the world needs, and we take pride in doing so reliably and responsibly,” said David Harris, ESG executive sponsor and executive vice president, exploration and production. “Among other achievements, I’m most proud of our significant reduction in GHG emissions.”Devon Energy’s 2020 Sustainability Report highlights progress and goals in key priority areas: Emissions: To reinforce its commitment to emissions reductions, in 2019 Devon voluntarily set a methane-intensity target to reduce emissions to 0.28% or lower by 2025. By focusing on detecting and repairing leaks, avoiding venting and flaring, evaluating and implementing new technologies, and other operational improvements, Devon has reached its target and continues finding ways to reduce emissions even further. Total greenhouse gas emissions intensity improved by 19% in 2019 compared to 2018. Flaring: Devon’s flaring performance has improved over the last five years to a rate below 1% of natural gas produced after the company took ownership of a portion of the midstream gas compression equipment associated with its Delaware Basin operations and proceeded to minimize conditions that caused most of the flaring. Water conservation: Devon has invested significant capital to reduce reliance on fresh water for many years, and in 2019, 90% of all water used by Devon for operations in the Delaware Basin was recycled or brackish water. Pandemic and crisis management: After multiple crises in early 2020 health and economic Devon stepped up to support employees while continuing to meet energy demands. To keep employees safe and healthy after COVID struck, the company quickly implemented flexible work practices and health and safety precautions on work sites. And even though there was a sharp decline in demand for oil, operations also made significant changes to respond to the decline while maintaining business continuity and positioning the company for recovery. People: In 2019 Devon supplemented flexible work arrangements, added time off for employees fostering children in their home, and expanded its stock awards program for employees. Additionally, Devon leaders engaged with employees on inclusion and diversity topics to proactively increase awareness, understand challenges and support employees so they may contribute their best every day. Communities: In 2019, Devon invested a total of $6.2 million to support social causes in local communities. The company supported STEM educational programs and the development of STEM-focused centers in collaboration with organizations like the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation. Devon’s Give for Good campaign in 2019 raised more than $1.7 million for the United Way of Central Oklahoma and the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma.“We continue to evolve and advance our ESG program and have become a leader in our industry as a result,” said Harris. “In addition to setting meaningful targets, we take great pride in transparent reporting and showing our progress each year. This is our 16th consecutive year of CDP climate reporting and we continue raising the bar for ourselves. I’m thankful to everyone who has helped us on our journey so far and to those helping us achieve even more as we stretch to become a better company.”

Devon Energy has agreed to buy rival WPX in a deal valued at $12bn, the biggest in the shale industry since the collapse of crude prices earlier this year.
The transaction unites the two companies in a bet on the Permian, the world's most prolific oilfield, which stretches between Texas and New Mexico and is the heart of the US shale industry.
WPX investors will receive 0.5165 Devon shares for each WPX share they own. The $12bn value of the transaction includes the debts of both companies. Devon shareholders will own approximately 57 per cent of the new company, to be called Devon Energy.
""This merger is a transformational event for Devon and WPX as we unite our complementary assets, operating capabilities and proven management teams to maximise our business in today's environment,"" said Dave Hager, Devon chief executive, who will become chairman. Rick Muncrief, head of WPX, will become chief executive. The new operator would be one of the largest unconventional energy producers in the US, he said.
In April, US crude prices briefly traded below zero, prompting widespread misery in the country's oil sector. Amid rising job losses and dozens of bankruptcies, and a near-25 per cent drop in US oil output, a wave of consolidation in the sector had been expected. But aside from Chevron's agreement to buy Noble Energy, which holds international and US shale assets, dealmaking has been relatively thin so far.
The shale patch has grown notorious among investors for its failure to generate profits or return capital.
But Devon said the deal's synergies would yield $575m in annual cash flow improvements by 2021. It would be ""immediately accretive"" in earnings, free cash flow, and invested capital, it said. The new company would pay a ""fixed plus variable"" dividend.
Andrew Gillick, energy sector strategist at Enverus, a consultancy, said the deal ""bolsters Devon's basin-leading position in the Permian and allows WPX shareholders to be part of a platform that delivers the cash flow and return of capital investors are looking for"".
Devon's market capitalisation hit more than $60bn in 2008 but was just $3.4bn before the deal was announced. WPX's was just $2.5bn.

Devon Energy Corp. and WPX Energy Inc. agreed to an all-stock merger that would create one of the biggest U.S. shale producers, the companies said Monday.
The combined entity's estimated market value of about $6 billion would exceed the current value of all but seven other independent U.S. energy producers, according to data collected by RBC Capital Markets.
The deal could help the two companies ride out the oil-market slump coming after the coronavirus pandemic crippled global demand, leading American frackers to cut spending dramatically. U.S. benchmark oil prices are hovering around $40 a barrel, a level at which most shale producers can't produce profitably -- and bankruptcy looms over many weaker companies if the slump persists.
Devon Chief Executive Dave Hager said the move would accelerate plans to ditch the shale industry's old strategy of pursuing rapid production growth at all costs and focus instead on generating income that exceeds drilling expense and returning excess cash to shareholders.
Mr. Hager will serve as the executive chairman of the combined company, which will be called Devon Energy, with Richard Muncrief, WPX's chairman and chief executive, serving as president and CEO.
""Investors have been vocal in advocating for responsible consolidation in our industry,"" Mr. Hager said on a conference call.
Even before the pandemic, investors were generally avoiding the shale industry as most companies generated lackluster returns and spent more money than they made from drilling wells.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy and WPX Energy on Monday announced they have entered into an agreement to combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction.The strategic combination will create a leading unconventional oil producer in the U.S., with an asset base underpinned by a premium acreage position in the economic core of the Delaware Basin.The combined company, which will be named Devon Energy, will benefit from enhanced scale, improved margins, higher free cash flow and the financial strength to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through an industry-first ""fixed plus variable"" dividend strategy.Under the terms of the agreement, Tulsa-based WPX shareholders will receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.5165 shares of Devon common stock for each share of WPX common stock owned. The exchange ratio, together with closing prices for Oklahoma City-based Devon and WPX on Sept. 25, results in an enterprise value for the combined entity of approximately $12 billion.Upon completion of the transaction, Devon shareholders will own 57% of the combined company and WPX shareholders will own 43% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis.The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies. Funds managed by EnCap Investments LP own 27% of the outstanding shares of WPX and have entered into a support agreement to vote in favor of the transaction. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals by Devon and WPX shareholders.""This merger is a transformational event for Devon and WPX as we unite our complementary assets, operating capabilities and proven management teams to maximize our business in today's environment, while positioning our combined company to create value for years to come,"" said Dave Hager, Devon's president and CEO.""Bringing together our asset bases will drive immediate synergies and enable the combined company to accelerate free cash flow growth and return of capital to shareholders. In addition to highly complementary assets, Devon and WPX have similar values, and a disciplined returns-oriented focus, reinforcing our belief that this is an ideal business combination,"" Hager added.""This merger-of-equals strengthens our confidence that we will achieve all of our five-year targets outlined in late 2019,"" said Rick Muncrief, WPX's chairman and CEO.""The combined company will be one of the largest unconventional energy producers in the U.S. and with our enhanced scale and strong financial position, we can now accomplish these objectives for shareholders more quickly and efficiently. We will create value for shareholders of both companies through the disciplined management of our combined assets and an unwavering focus on profitable, per-share growth,"" Muncrief said.The merger accelerates Devon's transition to a business model that prioritizes free cash flow generation over production growth. With this strategy, management is committed to limiting reinvestment rates to 70% to 80% of operating cash flow and restricting production growth to 5% or less annually. Free cash flow will be deployed toward higher dividends, debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases.The combined company expects to benefit from a premier multi-basin portfolio, headlined by the world-class acreage position in the Delaware Basin that is 400,000 net acres and accounts for nearly 60% of the combined company's total oil production. The Delaware Basin acreage is geographically diversified between southeast New Mexico and Texas, with only 35% of the leasehold on federal land. The consolidated Delaware footprint provides a multi-decade inventory of high-return opportunities at combined activity levels of 17 drilling rigs. The balance of the portfolio will be diversified across high-margin, high-return resource plays in the Anadarko Basin, Williston Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Powder River Basin.Cost savings from initiatives underway in the second half of 2020 and synergies resulting from the merger are expected to drive $575 million in annual cash flow improvements by year-end 2021.After the merger, the board of directors will consist of 12 members: seven directors from Devon and five from WPX including the lead independent director. Hager will be appointed executive chairman of the board, and Muncrief will be named president and CEO.The combined company's executive team will include Jeff Ritenour as executive vice president and chief financial officer, Clay Gaspar as executive vice president and chief operating officer, David Harris as executive vice president and chief corporate development officer, Dennis Cameron as executive vice president and general counsel, and Tana Cashion as senior vice president of human resources.

Being a small fish in the world of gigantic oil-and-gas majors is tough, especially when oil prices remain low. Shale drillers Devon Energy and WPX Energy are taking matters into their own hands.
The two companies saw their shares rally 12% and 16% by midday, respectively, after announcing an all-stock merger Monday morning. Devon, which had a market value of $3.4 billion before Monday's market open, is getting roughly 57% of the combined entity that will carry its name, while the $2.5 billion WPX is getting 43%.
The combination, which still requires shareholders' approval, certainly seems like a protective move for both, which have lost more than 60% of their value year to date, even after Monday's rally. That is a steeper decline than the 50% loss that the broader basket of oil-and-gas exploration companies have seen. Both companies are non-investment-grade issuers and have substantial exposure to unconventional basins, where extraction is costlier but capital expenditures can be turned on and off more rapidly.
There is something for both parties here: For Devon Energy, the merger reduces the company's exposure to federal lands—cushioning it against potential election risk, according to a report from Scotiabank. For WPX, whose credit rating is two notches lower than Devon, it would help reduce leverage. The merger will reduce the break-even price for the combined company to $33 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate crude, according to the companies. They figure they can cut $575 million worth of costs together by year-end 2021, including through drilling and operating efficiencies.
It's not only the larger scale that investors seem to be excited about. The combined company has a novel dividend policy, one that Devon has been mulling for some time. It promises to pay out as much as 50% of excess free cash flow in dividends, which would be on top of a fixed dividend of $0.11 per share, Devon's current rate. The payout is a substantial perk for WPX common stock investors, who haven't been receiving dividends at all, and could partly explain why its shares are enjoying a larger boost.
Of course, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the dividend is very high in the current oil-price environment. Still, the promise of a juicy dividend—even if in the distant future—seems to be enough to get investors excited, again.

Devon Energy Corp. and WPX Energy Inc. have agreed to an all-stock merger that would create one of the biggest U.S. shale producers, the companies said Monday.
The combined entity's estimated market value of about $6 billion would exceed the current value of all but seven other independent U.S. energy producers, according to data collected by RBC Capital Markets. The Wall Street Journal on Saturday reported that the companies were in talks to merge .
The deal could help the two companies ride out the oil-market slump coming after the coronavirus pandemic crippled global demand, leading American frackers to cut spending dramatically.

""Investors have been vocal in advocating for responsible consolidation in our industry,"" Mr. Hager said on a conference call.
Even before the pandemic, investors were generally avoiding the shale industry as most companies generated lackluster returns and spent more money than they made from drilling wells and pumping oil and gas. Collectively, 32 U.S. shale drillers outspent their cash flow in all but three quarters since the start of 2014, according to the consulting firm Rystad Energy.
Mr. Hager vowed the combined company would keep investment rates at 70% to 80% of operating cash flow and limit output growth to 5%, even in a more favorable oil-price environment. In addition to a fixed dividend, it also plans to implement a quarterly variable dividend that would distribute some of its available cash to shareholders.
Mr. Muncrief said the company would target 5% growth in oil production if prices were above $50 a barrel. ""Longer term, if you've had a more constructive environment and you felt very confident that the higher prices were here to stay, then we could adjust accordingly,"" he said.
Under the merger agreement, WPX shareholders receive 0.5165 shares of Devon for each share of WPX common stock owned. Devon shareholders would own about 57% of the combined entity, and WPX shareholders about 43%, the companies said. The enterprise value for the combined entity would be about $12 billion, they said.
Together, the companies would produce about 277,000 barrels of oil a day, with most of that coming from 400,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, the western part of the nation's largest oil-producing region in West Texas and New Mexico. They said the cost savings under way in the second half of the year and those resulting from the merger are expected to improve annual cash flow by $575 million by the end of 2021.
The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021, the companies said. They said funds managed by EnCap Investments LP, which own about 27% of WPX shares outstanding, have supported the agreement.

Devon Energy Corp. and WPX Energy Inc. are in talks to combine, according to people familiar with the matter, in a move that could help the energy companies weather a prolonged industry slump.
The companies are discussing an all-stock deal that would create an entity with a combined current market value of about $6 billion. An agreement could be completed as soon as Monday, assuming the talks don't fall apart, the people said. Devon has a market value of roughly $3.4 billion, while WPX's is about $2.5 billion.
American shale drillers, which had helped make the U.S. the world's top oil producer, have been hammered by the drop in demand caused by the pandemic. Companies have sharply cut drilling budgets and pulled back on growth as they seek to conserve cash during the downturn. Still, U.S. benchmark oil prices are hovering around $40, a level at which most cannot produce profitably, and many weaker companies are threatened with bankruptcy if the slump persists.
In a sign of the devastation, Devon's shares have dropped about 64% in the past year, while WPX's fell by around 57%. The declines are steeper than those of many of the companies' larger rivals and compare to a roughly 53% decline in a broad index of U.S. oil-and-gas companies. Devon's market value is a shadow of what it once was. At its peak in 2008, the company was worth more than $50 billion. WPX was worth more than $8 billion at its peak just two years ago.
Small and midsize oil-and-gas companies have performed poorly in recent years and already faced pressure from investors to deliver more consistent profits and cash flow. One way to do that is to combine forces to achieve economies of scale and reduce administrative costs.
But merger activity in the industry has been slow this year, partly because buyers are offering modest or no premiums and sellers are hesitant to strike deals while their share prices are low. But in July, Chevron Corp. agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion in what was the largest oil tie-up since the coronavirus pandemic jolted the industry beginning in mid-March, and analysts anticipate more deals in the coming months.
A combination would give Devon a larger foothold in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the nation's top oil-drilling region, and an entry into North Dakota, where Tulsa, Okla.-based WPX also has holdings in the Williston Basin.
A more diverse portfolio could help the combined company better handle challenges such as transportation bottlenecks and storage constraints, said Alex Beeker, an analyst for consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.
""It helps balance out those risks for the company and the shareholders,"" he said.
Devon, founded in 1971, was the first company to pair horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, a technique that fueled the American shale boom. The company, based in Oklahoma City, once was among the nation's top independent natural-gas producers , though it eventually was overshadowed by more aggressive peers.
Devon, whose acreage stretches from South Texas to Wyoming, has spent the last couple of years culling its portfolio to focus more on U.S. oil drilling.

Oil companies are reporting their worst earnings results in years, but their stocks are on the rise. In fact, the energy sector is up 4% on the week, better than any other sector in the market.
It is a sign that investors have moved on from the disastrous second quarter and are starting to pick winners for the future. Among the companies winning strong reviews for their earnings reports are shale-oil drillers Devon Energy (ticker: DVN), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Diamondback Energy (FANG).
They aren't the only ones getting the benefit of the doubt. Major European oil companies have also been up over the past two days following BP's (BP) announcement on Tuesday
that it will cut its dividend in half
, a decision that was less drastic than some analysts had expected.
It helps that the price of oil has been rising. On Wednesday, crude futures jumped. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 3.8% to $46.11. as West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose by 3.9% to $43.34.
Oil inventories fell over the past week,
the U.S. Energy Information Administration said
on Wednesday. Oil prices also rose on Tuesday
after an explosion in Beirut
. There were initial fears that the blast was caused by an attack, though more evidence now indicates it was an accident.
For some U.S. producers, it has also helped that they are returning cash to shareholders, or committing to return it in the years ahead. Devon Energy was up 9.3% near midday Wednesday after announcing a $100 million special dividend—26 cents per share—connected to the earlier-than-expected sale of its holdings in the Barnett shale play in Texas. Devon also impressed Wall Street by producing more oil than expected despite drastic cuts in capital spending. And its projections for the rest of the year indicate that trend will continue.
Devon reduced its capital-spending guidance while increasing its production guidance, Raymond James analyst John Freeman noted. And Devon is reducing debt. ""Notably, Devon plans to repurchase up to $1.5 billion in outstanding debt which should result in a $75 million reduction in annual interest expense,"" he wrote.
Pioneer Natural Resources also was rising on Wednesday after posting better-than-expected production and in-line earnings. Shares were up 2.4%. Its production beat expectations by 7% even as its capital expenses came in 11% below expectations.
In addition, Pioneer plans to return more cash to shareholders.
""Pioneer announced a long-term plan targeting 10%+ shareholder total return,"" Freeman wrote. ""The plan involves cash flow reinvestment of 70-80% that will deliver 5% plus oil growth and the remaining cash flow delivered to shareholders through the combination of a growing base dividend and variable dividend.""
Diamondback Energy also
showed it can be more efficient
, reporting ""impressive reductions in well costs and cash operating costs, both of which we believe may represent the lowest in the Permian,"" according to Truist analyst Neal Dingmann. ""Get ready for months and months of free cash flow,"" he wrote. Diamondback shares were up 3.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.2%.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy Corp. on Tuesday reported a net loss for the second quarter of $670 million, or $1.78 per diluted share.The Oklahoma City-based oil and gas exploration company posted revenue for the second quarter of $394 million.“As we navigate through the challenges presented by the COVID-19 crisis, our top priority continues to be the safety and well-being of our employees and the communities in which we operate,” said Dave Hager, president and CEO. “I want to commend our workforce for rapidly adjusting to difficult industry conditions. Our strong second-quarter operational results demonstrate the professionalism of our employees to safely execute our business plan and protect shareholder value.”Second-quarter oil production averaged 153,000 barrels per day, a 6% increase from the year-ago period and exceeding midpoint guidance by 3,000 barrels per day, resulting from better-than-expected base production performance in the Eagle Ford and Anadarko Basin.Due to low oil prices in the quarter, Devon voluntarily curtailed 10,000 barrels per day. As oil prices have stabilized and begun to recover, the company has no plans to curtail production in the second half of 2020.Capital spending in the second quarter totaled $203 million, or 10% less than midpoint guidance. This positive variance was attributable to efficiency gains in the Delaware Basin and improvements in service-cost pricing. Devon exited the second quarter running nine operated drilling rigs and one completion crew.Devon and Banpu Kalnin Ventures plan to accelerate the scheduled closing date of the Barnett Shale asset sale to Oct. 1 from the previously arranged date of Dec. 31. After accounting for purchase-price adjustments, which include an upfront deposit of $170 million and allocated revenue and expenses from the effective date, Devon expects to receive a net cash payment of more than $300 million at closing.The Barnett Shale sale agreement also provides Devon the opportunity for contingent cash payments of up to $260 million based upon future commodity prices, with upside participation beginning at either a $2.75 Henry Hub natural gas price or a $50 West Texas Intermediate oil price. The contingent payment period commences on Jan. 1, 2021, and has a term of four years. The contingent payments are earned and paid on an annual basis.With the accelerated closing of the Barnett Shale divestiture, Devon’s board of directors declared a special dividend of 26 cents per share of common stock. The special dividend will result in a payment of $100 million to shareholders by Devon. The special dividend is payable Oct. 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Aug. 14. The special dividend is in addition to the regular quarterly cash dividend of 11 cents per share.“With the visibility we have on the early closing of the Barnett transaction, I am excited to announce that we are returning a portion of the proceeds to our shareholders in the form of a $100 million special dividend,” said Hager. “The decision to issue a special dividend is consistent with our disciplined strategy and demonstrates our firm commitment to return increasing amounts of cash directly to our shareholders.”Devon also announced plans for cash-cost reductions of $300 million by the end of the year. The cost-reduction plan includes several actions to better align the workforce with activity levels, achieve more efficient field-level operations and decrease financing costs. The PV-10 of the cost savings plan is estimated to exceed $1 billion of value over the next five years.A contributing factor to the cost-reduction plan is Devon’s intent to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding debt. The debt-reduction program is expected to result in interest savings of $75 million on an annual basis.“As we navigate through the challenges presented by COVID-19, Devon continues to transform how it operates,” said Jeff Ritenour, executive vice president and chief financial officer. “The next phase of our strategic plan is to take meaningful and decisive steps to sustainably improve our cost structure and reduce debt. The aggressive reduction of cash costs across our organization is expected to drive down per-unit expenses by an incremental 10% versus our second-quarter 2020 results.”

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.82 billion, or $4.82 per share, attributable to a $2.8 billion impairment charge due to asset evaluations connected to market conditions.The company reported revenue of $2.09 billion, up from $1.5 billion this time last year. Ongoing cost-saving efforts started before the pandemic helped the company save money throughout the quarter, the company said.Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring costs and to account for discontinued operations, came to 13 cents per share. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for a loss of 18 cents per share.""Devon has entered these difficult times with the benefit of a strong balance sheet, excellent liquidity and top-tier assets,” said Dave Hager, president and chief executive officer. “In this uncertain environment, our top strategic priority is to preserve our financial strength, and our decisive actions to date have accomplished exactly that. Our swift response to recalibrate drilling and completion activity and lower operating costs ensures that we can fund all our 2020 capital requirements within cash flow.""Although shares of Devon fell 2.1% Tuesday to close at $11.18, the stock price rose after-hours following the earnings release. Tuesday's closing price was down 64% versus this time last year.“The market, at this point, seems to be rewarding Devon,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Tulsa-based Longbow Asset Management. “(They) have some strong metrics.”The company’s strong assets and “good corporate planning” have distinguished it to be on the good side of the “have and have-nots” of the oil and gas industry, he said. “Devon is in a superior position to its peers.""The debt reduction program started by the company in February 2019 continues to save it money, with Devon reporting first-quarter general and administrative expenses reduced 33% year-over-year, driven by layoffs, an $8 million reduction in financing costs and a 6% drop in production costs due to the divestiture of Balkan and Canadian assets.Field operating cost efficiencies drove upstream capital expenditures 12% below midpoint guidance, with production expense decreasing 11% year-over year to $8.47 per barrel of oil.Devon’s oil production increased 15% from the first quarter of 2019 to 163,000 barrels per day, exceeding the company’s midpoint guidance by 3,000 barrels per day. Through the first quarter Devon kept capital expenditures down at $391 million, 12% below midpoint guidance.The company reported an operating cash flow of $529 million, up 21% from $437 million in the first quarter of 2019.In an effort to adjust to low commodity prices, Devon plans to reduce oil production by 10,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and expects full-year 2020 production to be flat compared to 2019.Due to the savings from those production costs and lower general and administrative expenses, Devon lowered its 2020 expense outlook by $250 million to $1.65 billion.“We are confident that we will emerge from this downturn a strong company, and we are well positioned to take full advantage of our high-quality portfolio when commodity prices normalize,” Hager said.

| Jump to first hitCabinet Room3:18 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you very much. It's a great honor to be with the world leaders in American oil and gas and, really, I could say, the world leaders, period, when it comes to energy and American energy. The biggest companies anywhere - anywhere in the world.I want to thank Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt; Secretary of Energy, Dan Brouillette; and Ambassador Robert Lighthizer for being here.We're also joined by Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senators John Cornyn, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, and Dan Sullivan. Thank you. These are people that really want to see good energy at the good price.With us as well are Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of an extremely small company known as Exxon Mobil. Well, it's smaller today than it was four weeks ago - (laughter) - by about half, right? That's all right. It'll be better than ever.Today we'll discuss the impact of the coronavirus on American energy industry. As the pandemic brought on by global economy - I mean, it's an incredible thing that's happened. Nobody thought this was possible. We had the greatest economy in the world. Probably, you were doing - all of you - the best ever. Everybody was doing the best ever. And then, all of a sudden, they said, You have to shut down the country, and they have to shut down the world, because the whole world is shut down, not the country. The whole world is shut down: 151 countries. Probably, it's higher than that now. That was as of a week ago.So the entire world is shut down, trying to get rid of this scourge. And - and we'll do it.I thought what I might do is go around the room and you just introduce yourselves to the media real quickly, and then we'll have a discussion afterwards. You know, our 2.2-trillion-dollar relief package includes provisions to allow businesses to deduct their losses this year against taxes they paid in previous years, which gets you a lot of liquidity. And a lot of companies need the liquidity right now.And hopefully we're going to be back in business very soon. We're going to be open very soon. This country wasn't built to be closed. And, essentially, we have a closed country. Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this.But this was - I was with some of the leading professionals, and they say not since 1917 has there been anything like this. 1917 was a time when, I guess, you could say, 50, 75, or 100 million - you hear different estimates - people died. Think of that: 100 million. Maybe 100 million people died. So they had no communications. They weren't able to shut things down like we are doing.But that was a - that was a plague. That was a plague. It started here, actually. It went to Europe. We were badly affected, but Europe was really affected. So that was the worst.So not since 100 years ago - more than 100 years ago has this - a thing like this happened.I just want to start by saying it's an honor to be with you. I know most of you, one way or the other. Some of you I know, and - but I know all of you by seeing you on the covers of all the business magazines and the magazines. And you've done a great job, and we'll work this out and we'll get our energy business back. I'm with you 1,000 percent. It's a great business. It's a very vital business. And, honestly, you've been very fair. You've kept energy prices reasonable for a long period of time. We've got a long period of time with very reasonable energy prices.So I want to thank you all for being here. And maybe we'll start with Mike. Please.MR. WIRTH: All right. Mike Wirth with Chevron Corporation, Mr. President. I'm proud of the work our people are doing to support healthcare providers, first responders, and all the other vital industries that keep our economy going.Thank you for having us.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike, very much. Appreciate it.MS. HOLLUB: Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum.THE PRESIDENT: Hi, Vicki.MS. HOLLUB: Thank you for allowing us to be here today and thank you for all you're doing for us.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you, Vicki.MR. HAGER: Dave Hager, with Devon Energy. We're an independent oil and gas company out of Oklahoma City. And thank you so much for the leadership that you're providing during this challenging time. And we - you're the right man at the right time to balance all the priorities. And we're going to be back. Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: We'll get it done, Dave. Thank you very much.MR. GARLAND: Mr. President, I'm Greg Garland, Phillips 66. Again, thank you for your great leadership through this pandemic crisis and all that you've done on the stimulus package, really, for the American economy. I'm proud of our employees. They're working to provide energy and improve lives.THE PRESIDENT: We think it's going to come back quickly. It's - it's ready. We're ready. And we've got the right packages out there. So -MR. GARLAND: We need it, too.THE PRESIDENT: Very good. We're looking at a - I think we're going to be really looking very seriously at a infrastructure package where - it's so important for our country.You know, as of this moment, Darren, we have $7 trillion-plus in the Middle East. For what? For what reason? And we don't put money in our own country. So we're going to do a big - a big package on infrastructure fairly soon, I think, and that's very important. And it's great for you, great for everybody.Darren, please.MR. WOODS: Thank you, Mr. President. Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil Corporation. I'd like to add my thanks for your leadership in this space, as well, and say I think all of our companies here align with your objective, which is to get the economy moving and to make people's lives around the world better.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Great job you've done. Thank you.MR. HAMM: Harold Hamm, chairman of Continental Resources, also out of Oklahoma City. Thanks for having this meeting. I think this is so timely and necessary. Really appreciate your leadership, also the friendship that you've kept with the Saudis - the Saudi Crown minister - or Crown Prince, and also Vladimir Putin. I know those haven't been easy sometimes, but at this time, it was particularly needed.So I represent our company, as well as DEPA - Domestic Energy Producers Alliance. And we're about 10,000 companies and individuals - mostly independent producers.THE PRESIDENT: That's great. Great job you're doing.I think President Putin and the Crown Prince want something to happen badly. Certainly terrible for them, what's happening, too. So they want to see something happen. I've spoken to both of them and we'll tell you about that in a little while. Okay?Thank you very much.MR. HILDEBRAND: Thank you, Mr. President. Jeff Hildebrand, founder and chairman, Hilcorp Energy. Our distinction is we are the only private company here. This is a company that's based in Houston, domestic-only exploration and production company.And I'm really here today to represent the independent energy companies, the family-owned businesses that are in this industry, and to give you, really, that perspective and add to the conversation in that regard.THE PRESIDENT: Good. That's great.MR. HILDEBRAND: So thank you for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. HILDEBRAND: Appreciate it.THE PRESIDENT: Great job. Thank you.MR. HILDEBRAND: You bet.MR. WARREN: Thank you, Mr. President. Kelcy Warren, Energy Transfer. We're the only pipeline company. And so we try to do business with everybody in this room, and I think we successfully do, actually. So it's an honor to be here, sir, and it's an honor to be in this room with these folks as well.THE PRESIDENT: And everyone loves that guy, right? We all do. Thank you very much, Kelcy. Great. Great job you're doing, too.He's not an oil and gas man. He's a wonderful person and a wonderful politician and he wants to see the industry get strong again. So, Kevin, do you have anything to say, by the way?LEADER MCCARTHY: Well, first, I want to thank you for doing this. Just by you reaching out to President Putin and the Crown Prince, things have improved. You're looking around at a lot of jobs, but what else you're not seeing at this table: A lot of these are small businesses that work with all these individuals around here. And your action today, with signing the CARES Act, getting the small-business loans out, is going very strongly -THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.LEADER MCCARTHY: - because it's needed.THE PRESIDENT: It's doing well.LEADER MCCARTHY: But the American economy - the greatest strength is our - what energy provides us. You provide us at a good price. These are great jobs. But more importantly, it also gives us energy independence. It changes the whole dynamics around the world.And so I thank you for the leadership and what you're doing.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Kevin. And as you just said, the Bank of America, in particular, has really - of the big banks - has really stepped into it. They have done a fantastic job. Today, it's over -LEADER MCCARTHY: Ten thousand in the first two hours.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Bank of America has been unbelievable. And I want to thank them. I want to thank all of the community banks and the smaller banks that have been loaning a lot of money - paycheck. It's all about the paycheck. And that - nobody would have believed it could have gone so well.So it's - it's just a number of hours. But the numbers are far greater than we would have anticipated. So it's been really great.And thank you to all the banks, but again, in particular, Bank of America. They really stepped right up and they did it. There were no big deals. They weren't making a big deal out of anything. So that was terrific.And I think what we want to do - John Cornyn, please. I know how you are so involved in this, coming from the great state of Texas. Would you like to say a couple of words, John?SENATOR CORNYN: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for convening the meeting. Many of us have been talking together, but we can't get done what needs to be done. Only you and the administration can. And particularly, getting the attention of the Saudis and flooding the markets, really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy was suffering anyway because of the coronavirus. And so this meeting could not be more timely.I agree with what's been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living. And, really, we've changed the - changed the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here, and improved the quality of life for a lot of people.THE PRESIDENT: Thanks very much, John. Really good job. And John agrees - we were talking about it the other day - that you've all done well, but you've also kept energy very affordable, really. Very, very affordable and very - a lot of it. We never had any problems. And we're going to keep it that way.Do I see Dan back there? Dan?SENATOR SULLIVAN: Yes, sir, Mr. President. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: I was looking - I thought that looked like Dan.SENATOR SULLIVAN: I want to thank you for convening this meeting. You know, under the Trump administration, working with the Congress, the U.S. has become the world's energy superpower again. It's unbelievable. And these companies have done it. Obviously it's a very important issue in my state, the great state of Alaska. But these are great jobs, as John Cornyn just said, for all of our states. But it's really important for the national security of our country too.And we have been - a number of senators have been reaching out, having frank discussions with the Saudis, saying, Hey, if you're a longstanding ally of ours, we're not - right now, you're hurting a lot of our citizens. You're hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn't take us for granted.We have a great military that's protected Saudi Arabia for decades. And Senator Cramer and I have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don't start cooperating.So again, we appreciate your leadership with the Crown Prince, with the Russians, in calling this meeting.But this is a great sector of the U.S. economy that, once we get through this, and we will - of this pandemic, this -this sector is going to take off again. And your - your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the U.S. energy sector. And we need to keep it strong.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Dan.And Kevin Cramer, North Dakota. People don't realize how big a producer North Dakota is. Right?SENATOR CRAMER: Well, Harold knows. (Laughter.)SENATOR CORNYN: Harold knows.SENATOR CRAMER: It sort of allows the others (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT: Harold - Harold knows, that's for sure.SENATOR CRAMER: Mr. President, to echo everything and maybe add a little bit: The people around your Cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country. But since you became President, we went from a renaissance to security, to independence, to dominance. And that dominance and that security are - right now are in some danger.Just a quick example: In North Dakota, since Saudi Arabia and Russia announced their little price war, we've had $6 billion of cutbacks taken out of our state, planned for this year.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.SENATOR CRAMER: I was economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of North Dakota was $13 billion. So that's significant. That represents not just capex; that represents lots of jobs, lots of people in the value chain.And I would just add one word to what Dan talked about with regard to Saudi Arabia. It is estimated by one report in 2018 that we spent a minimum of $81 billion defending global oil supplies. We can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world, if our friends are going to treat us this way.So I appreciate your outreach this week. I think we're halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week. Thank you for this meeting.THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's gone up. It's gone up. And we have to. Otherwise, we do - we lose a lot of jobs too. We're talking about one of the big job producers anywhere, Kevin, right?Would you have anything to say?MR. SOMMERS: Mr. President, thank you. I'm Mike Sommers. I'm President and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute. The folks around this table represent the American energy revolution, and we want to thank you for everything that you've done to support that revolution. And we want to make sure that revolution continues -THE PRESIDENT: Right.MR. SOMMERS: - after this pandemic crisis is solved.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike.MR. SOMMERS: Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Very good.LEADER MCCARTHY: I think Senator Cruz was somewhere -THE PRESIDENT: I think he's around here.LEADER MCCARTHY: Right back there. Ted can't be seen.THE PRESIDENT: Where - where is Senator Cruz?PARTICIPANT: He's hiding behind the press. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: I can't believe it. He's gone - he's gone over to the evil side. (Laughter.) That's terrible.Cruz, what are you doing there?SENATOR CRUZ: Mr. President, thank you for convening this meeting. This is an important meeting and this is the time, as you know, of crisis all across the country - a public health crisis and an economic crisis.As you've heard, and as you know, from everyone around this table, the energy sector has been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we've enjoyed over the last several years. And the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis, combined with the Saudis and Russians waging economic warfare on jobs in this country, it's been a perfect storm in the energy sector.And I'll tell you, there are a lot of jobs - there are millions of jobs in Texas and across the country that are represented by the men and women around this table and by energy producers. And there are small producers throughout Texas and throughout the country who are - who are on the verge of being driven out of business.And so this - this meeting, I think, is important. Every one of the senators in this room has had multiple conversations with the Saudis, leaning in hard on the Saudis. And your leadership and diplomacy with the Crown Prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage of this crisis.And I would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raised and I'm very concerned about: is ensuring that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital. That - there are jobs that are hanging in the balance. And if the energy producers in this country that have made America the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can't access capital to get out of this crisis, we're going to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn't seen in decades.And so this meeting and the continued leadership of your administration is hugely important. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you very much, Ted. And while you're up, the concept, and, for instance - I think we should say it in front of the media - but oil reserves, storing oil. We're filling up the national reserves, as you know. We're getting the oil at a great price.But at these prices - in fact, Kevin and I have been speaking about it; John and I have been speaking about it - at these prices, you would think you'd want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country. And there's some areas in Louisiana and other areas that could be filled up; they hold a lot of oil.But at these prices - and it would be good and it would keep everybody working - but you would think you'd want to fill up those areas. What do you think of that, Ted?SENATOR CRUZ: Look, I think that's exactly right. I think it makes sense in terms of easing the pressure that is threatening these jobs. But it also makes sense for the taxpayer.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.SENATOR CRUZ: That Strategic Petroleum Reserve is there in times of crisis. And usually the way the federal government works is we buy when it's expensive, and we sell when it's cheap.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. No, it's -SENATOR CRUZ: We actually have an opportunity now to buy when it's cheap. I think it was inexcusable that Democratic leadership in the House and Senate blocked that in this bill we passed last week. And then I think Congress needs to go back and address it.LEADER MCCARTHY: It was in the bill.SENATOR CRUZ: Yep.LEADER MCCARTHY: And then the Speaker came in and that's the one thing - when she held this bill up for the number of days - that she removed.THE PRESIDENT: Twenty-dollar oil. Think of it.LEADER MCCARTHY: Yeah.THE PRESIDENT: Twenty dollars.SENATOR CRUZ: Well, and there are too many Democrats -THE PRESIDENT: It's politics.SENATOR CRUZ: - that want to see these -THE PRESIDENT: It's all right.SENATOR CRUZ: - jobs go away.THE PRESIDENT: I think you should go back though, Kevin. I think you should go back and see, John, if you guys can go back and do a separate bill.And beyond that, you know, I think it's 75 million barrels right now to fill it up. That's not that much. So it's fairly in pretty good shape. But we have other areas that are bigger, frankly, that we can fill up too.But at those prices, we should be - we should be pumping it out. So maybe you guys can check on it and see what you can do about it. I don't think anyone can reject it. Nobody can reject it. Ted, you'll work on that?SENATOR CRUZ: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: Anybody else? David, you guys okay? David, you want to say something?SECRETARY BERNHARDT: So just one thing, Mr. President. The Department of the Interior manages a large portion of land and part of the offshore. And one of the things we have done over the last 15 days as you had the slow the spread, we have really had our inspectors out on the frontlines working to make sure that the production that's taking place is occurring in a safe and a responsible manner, and I thank everybody for their cooperation in that.These jobs are so important to the American people, and it's important that we make sure that we dot our I's and cross our T's too.THE PRESIDENT: He's the biggest landlord in the country. (Laughter.) Meaning, it's called Interior. Interior is a lot of land, when you look at it. Thank you. Great job you're doing.So, Dan, go ahead.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Mr. President, thank you. Thank you, sir, for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dan.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: My name is Dan Brouillette. I serve the President as the Secretary of Energy. With regard to the storage, Mr. President, I'm happy to announce we went to market this week for 30 million barrels. Notwithstanding the - the desire of the Congress not to give us new money to pursue this idea, we have found an alternative financing mechanism -THE PRESIDENT: Good.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: - so that we can immediately find -THE PRESIDENT: I figured you would. (Laughter.) I actually wasn't worried about it. (Laughter.)SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: - so that can we can find -THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying per barrel?SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: I'm sorry, sir?THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying? (Laughs.) He didn't want to answer.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: It's going to be a little a low. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying per barrel? A flexible price or would it -SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: They may be paying us. This could be a little low.THE PRESIDENT: So we're going to go negative, like interests rates. Negative.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: But, Mr. President, I just wanted you to know - and for the industry players who are here: We are moving very aggressively. We're using every tool that we have at the U.S. Department of Energy, not only to provide immediate relief for this particular industry and the economy itself, but also to look for technologies that over time will reduce the cost structure for the entire industry.So we're moving as aggressively as we can, sir. Thank you for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Dan, check out other areas where you can store oil.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: And there are some very big ones, bigger than what we have now. And at these prices, you should do it.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Refill it up, right?SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Fill up the tank.Okay, Bob Lighthizer, you've been so great. And this isn't your meeting really, but Bob has done some of the best trade deals ever done in our country. And one of them has kicked - it actually kicked in on April 1st, and that's with China. And I hope they're buying a lot. I hope.AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: I don't (inaudible) say anything.THE PRESIDENT: Want to say something?AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: I'm here to answer questions, Mr. President, so I'll just - I'll just keep my mouth shut. But the trade deals are working. China is good. We're on - we're on track with USMCA. But I'll just answer questions.THE PRESIDENT: He's very shy. That's good. He just wants to make deals. That's all. And you've done a great job. Thank you very much.We will have a news conference at about 5 o'clock, 5:15 maybe. And so we'll see you in a little while. We'll answer questions.But this is a great group of leaders, and we've got to make sure that we preserve and even make greater our energy industry. And I want to thank all of the senators and congressmen, the boss here, for being here and for working so hard. They are - I'll tell you what: They are calling me constantly. They want your industry to be successful and they really - and they're going to make it that way. We're all going to make it that way.So I'll see you at 5 o'clock and - same place. We look forward to it. Thank you. Thank you very much.Q One question about testing. Was anybody in here tested for coronavirus? We got the new guidance?THE PRESIDENT: Well, would anybody like to be tested? How about you?

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Enable Midstream Partners announced Thursday cuts to its quarterly distribution, capital expenditures and operational costs, which are expected to increase cash flow by $450 million, positioning the company “to fully fund its business” and reduce debt.The quarterly distribution has been decreased by half from 33.05 cents to 16.525 cents per common unit, adding $290 million in cash annually. Capital expenditures for 2020 have been decreased 48%, or $115 million, from the higher end of the previously announced capital budget.Remaining capital projects will serve incremental firm transportation commitments or support expected levels of contracted producer activity.The company is reducing costs of operation, maintenance, general and administrative expenses by $35 million in 2020 and $70 million in 2021 as well as cuts to maintenance capital of 17%, or $20 million, in 2020 and another $20 million in 2021.Enable Senior Communications Partner Leigh Ann Williamssaid “numerous cost-saving programs” would be used.She said in the email the company’s outlook for the year will be updated during its first-quarter earnings call in May.“As we face extraordinary times, we will continue to look at all the things we are doing and adjust our business accordingly to meet the challenges we face,” Williams said.“Making these decisions was a thorough process and we took great care in evaluating our response to the current business environment.”OGE Energy, which holds a 25.5% limited partner interest and 50% general partner interest in Enable, announced its support of the cuts. In a press release, OGE said it does not expect resulting changes to its operations or the need to access equity markets due to Enable’s actions, instead expecting distributions of $18 million for the quarter.With its announcement, Enable joins a long list of oil and gas companies making similar cuts in light of falling oil price and demand.Oneok, Chaparral Energy and Devon Energy were among the first Oklahoma companies in the industry to announce rollbacks in previously announced capital and operational budgets March 12, just days after the initial crash of oil prices and stock that followed disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia.Closely behind initial companies were cuts from Halliburton Energy Services, ConocoPhillips and Tulsa-based WPX Energy on March 18 as oil plummeted further to $20.37 a barrel, the first drop below $22 since 2002.Continental Resources announced capital spending cuts on March 19, followed bycutson March 30 by Alliance Resources Partners and again from Devon Energy.Enable is likely not to be the last to make such an announcement either, as analysts predict 2020 to have the first full-year decline in oil demand in more than a decade.The International Energy Agency reported global oil demand could fall by 20% during global lockdowns in response to COVID-19 and as much as 2.5 million barrels per day during the first quarter alone.

| Jump to first hitDevon Energy and Alliance Resource Partners announced capital and operational cuts Monday as oil reached an 18-year low.Alliance scrapped previously released operational and financial guidance, with plans to issue updated guidance at a later time; stopped coal production at its Illinois Basin Mines; and suspended cash distribution for the first quarter.The company said the adjustments are a response to the “rapidly evolving impact” of COVID-19 and the ongoing oil price war.Devon cut an additional $300 million from its capital expenditure budget for the year, bringing it to $1 billion, 45% lower than originally planned.The announcement follows a March 12 cut of $500 million. The company said the most substantial portion of that cut would be made in the STACK and the Powder River Basin while the company focused on the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford.The price of oil fell Monday $1.42, closing at $20.09,a numberlast seen in 2002.“The severity of this crisis and the speed at which it hit us is like nothing we’ve ever seen in our lifetime,” Longbow Asset Management Chief Executive Officer Jake Dollarhide said.“It’s been a horrendous three-headed monster between the virus, the oil spat and the prospects of a presidential election year,"" he said. ""We're going to see more production cuts, operating cuts, pulled guidance, eliminated dividends. Things like this are going to continue to happen in the oil and gas sector.”Alliance coal production is planned to cease through April 15, with production for the year expected to match existing sales commitments of 28 million tons. The company’s total sales tons are expected to be 25% below expectations. Suspension of cash distribution will be revisited after the second quarter.The company also plans to reduce costs, expenses, working capital and capital spending to mitigate commodity prices and lower coal sales, although the company did not put a number to these cuts.Alliance President Joseph Craft said in the release that “assuming we can successfully fulfill our coal sales commitments,” the announced steps will “substantially” offset lower revenue and allow the company to protect its balance sheet.""In implementing these actions, ARLP’s highest priorities remain safeguarding the employees’ health and safety, supporting the communities in our operating areas and serving our customers by continuing to safely and reliably operate our critical infrastructure. We are all in this together. We will get through this and be stronger for it,” Craft said.Devon’s new cuts will be made incrementally by deferring activity in the Eagle Ford, improving efficiency in the Delaware Basin and attaining lower prices in service costs. In a press release, the company said it expects to fund the capital budget with cash flow at strip pricing and more cuts could be made if commodity prices remain weak.“Our top priority in this environment is to protect Devon’s financial strength and liquidity. Our decisive actions to date have allowed us to rapidly recalibrate drilling and completion activity to ensure we can fund all our 2020 capital requirements within cash flow,” Devon President Dave Hager said in the release.Devon also announced entrance into regional basis swaps to create additional protection against lower commodity prices. The company has 80% of its 2020 oil production protected at an average floor price of $45 West Texas Intermediate and secured hedges on 40% of its 2020 natural gas production at an average floor price of $2.35 per thousand cubic feet, according to the release.Devon spokesman John Porretto said the company currently has no layoffs planned. Alliance could not be reached for comment about whether changes to itscost reduction measures include layoffs.

Microsoft MSFT-Nasdaq Outperform Price $184.44 on Feb. 13 by Evercore ISI
Our recent headquarters visit and discussion with finance leaders help galvanize our view that, while Microsoft is currently firing on all cylinders, there also is plenty of gas in the tank when taking a multiyear view. We raise our price target to $212 [from $190], based on the shares trading to 30 times enterprise value/calendar-2021 free cash flow.
We believe that the investment narrative for the next five years could be defined by 1) Azure's hybrid cloud portfolio and nonconflicted business model, which will allow Microsoft to sustain a competitive advantage, with its commercial cloud business eclipsing $100 billion in revenue by fiscal 2024. 2) The combination of the Teams and Power Platform [software, which] could help Microsoft reshape the business-productivity landscape and enable it to move beyond a tactical information-technology vendor to a key strategic partner in the ""middle office."" 3) Over the next three to five years, we expect Microsoft to make a bigger bet in the $277 billion enterprise apps market. This could open a whole new investment narrative. 4) 5G adoption and streaming could create an opportunity for Microsoft's gaming franchise. 5) Microsoft's commitment to sustainability adds to its investment narrative, and there could be some business benefits longer-term, in terms of more efficient data centers, etc.
HealthStream HSTM-Nasdaq Market Perform Price $25.91 on Feb. 20 by Barrington Research
HealthStream [which produces digital-training programs for health-care providers] reported fourth-quarter 2019 non-GAAP earnings per share of 11 cents, which exceeded our forecast and the FactSet consensus of six cents. The earnings upside was largely due to gross margin overage of 180 basis points [1.8 percentage points] and lower-than-expected product development costs, which more than offset general and administrative cost overage.
However, we are reducing our 2020 non-GAAP EPS forecast to 32 cents from 40 cents, due to higher-than-expected investment costs and an increase in our general and administrative cost forecast. Our initial 2021 non-GAAP EPS forecast is 28 cents. Our investment rating remains Market Perform, due to near-term headwinds from lower [resuscitation-product] revenue and valuation considerations.
The Cheesecake Factory CAKE-Nasdaq Underweight Price $40.88 on Feb. 19 by Barclays
Cheesecake's fourth-quarter 2019 results were noisy, but about in-line, and closed a tumultuous year, with uncertainty and a lack of financial visibility related to its acquisitions [of Fox Restaurant Concepts, plus Fox's share of the North Italia restaurant chain that Cheesecake Factory didn't already own]. 2020 offers a clean start, with the company's acquisitions fully in guidance. The company is expected to support about 8% revenue growth, and ultimately a 13% to 14% total shareholder return, including a currently outsize dividend. And while 2020 growth will be difficult to read, delivering on core comp and unit growth guidance would go a long way toward strengthening investor confidence.
That said, we remain cautious near term, as the core brand will have to share the spotlight with other, less-proven brands. Restaurant acquisitions historically have been challenging. The shares are at about 14 times forward price/earnings, versus a 13 to 22 times three-year range and about 17.5 times average. We are lowering estimates. Our revised price target is $36. Guidance, inclusive of the acquisitions, culminates in adjusted EPS of $2.70 to $2.86.
Devon Energy DVN-NYSE Buy Price $22.16 on Feb. 19 by Siebert Williams Shank
Devon Energy reported a solid fourth-quarter 2019, with an oil production beat on lower spending, driven by Delaware Basin execution. More importantly, Devon improved its 2020 outlook by tweaking lower its spending, to $1.72 billion to $1.88 billion, for slightly better oil production of 161 to 163 Mbbls/d [thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day] versus its preliminary outlook, exceeding Street expectations. 2021 is expected to generate mid- to high-single digit oil production growth, with flattish capital-expenditure spending. We reaffirm our Buy rating and $32 price target.
Walmart WMT-NYSE Sector Perform Price $119.63 on Feb. 18 by RBC Capital Markets
Walmart's fourth quarter started and ended well, but softness in certain general merchandise categories in the weeks leading up to Christmas weighed on sales. U.S. earnings before interest and taxes declined for the first time in seven quarters. However, the external pressures were largely transitory, and Walmart's full-year outlook seems reasonable. We remain on the sidelines, as we view the risk/reward as fairly balanced.
Our 2020-21 EPS forecasts go to $5.15/$5.45 from $5.20/$5.50. Our price target is unchanged at $124 a share.

| Jump to first hit OKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy announced late Tuesdaythe $770 million sale of its Barnett Shale assets and a $1 billion stock repurchase program, $800 million of which is conditioned on the sale.Devon’s stock closed at $24.70 Wednesday, up fromTuesday's closing price of$24.17.Plans to sell the assets, along with Canadian assets, were announced in February as part of a long-term strategic plan that includes cutting capital expenditures and focusing on its high-return U.S. oil portfolio. The $2.8 million sale of Devon’s Canadian assets was announced in May.The Barnett Shale asset agreement was struck with Banpu Kalnin Ventures, an investment firm focused on North American upstream oil and gas assets.The deal includes purchase price adjustments that allocate revenues and expenses based on a Sept. 1 effective date and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, according to a press release.The sale includes more than 320,000 gross acres and 4,200 producing wells that averaged a net production of 597 million cubic feet equivalent per day in the third quarter and had proved reserves at end of 2018 of about 4 trillion cubic feet equivalent.Oklahoma City University Finance Professor Deborah Fleming said the sale is a continuation of the company’s efforts to reinvent itself to adjust to investor pressure to be cash flow positive, which is difficult.“It’s not been an industry that has generated positive cash flow, because there’s been so much reinvestment in new exploration and producing what they’ve found,” Fleming said.“There is a huge amount of pressure from Wall Street, analysts, as well as the private equity funds.”Fleming said Devon’s choice to divest from Barnett was not surprising, considering the price of shale gas which will not improve soon due to the oversupply.Devon Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager said in the press release the transaction completes the company’s change to a U.S. oil growth business. The Barnett and Canada transactions generated $3.6 billion of proceeds for Devon’s valuation and “accelerate efforts” that will increase returns, margins and profitability, he said.“The Barnett Shale has been a cornerstone asset for Devon over the past two decades. With this change in ownership, it is great to see our talented and innovative employees supporting this high-quality gas asset transition to a world-class company like Banpu,” Hager said in the release.The new share-repurchase program expires Dec. 31, 2020, and brings the total repurchase authorization to $6 billion. Currently, Devon has repurchased 144 million shares, almost 30% of outstanding shares, at a total cost of $4.8 billion.Devon Chief Financial Officer Jeff Ritenour said in the release the repurchase program expansion demonstrates the company’s commitment to return capital to shareholders.“Given our strong balance sheet and projected free cash flow, this new authorization will provide us additional flexibility to continue the return of cash to our shareholders,” Ritenour said in the release.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy announced Tuesday a $100 million agreement with Dow to jointly developDevon's STACK acreage in the Anadarko Basin over four years.The average working interest is estimated at 60% across a mix of 133 standard and extended-reach lateral drilling locations.Lower well costs from focused infill development drilling and midstream incentive rates that decrease per-unit operating costs for each new well brought online are expected to enhance Devon’s returns from the agreement, according to a company press release.“Dow is a world-class company with whom we’ve had an ongoing relationship. We consider them to be one of our strategic partners,” Devon spokesman John Porretto said in an email.The agreement is not anticipated to change the company’s 2020 production targets or capital spending outlook. Drilling operations are expected to begin midyear on two drilling units in northern Canadian County.Devon will retain all of the production and cash flow from existing operations in the STACK and serve as operator, responsible for capital allocation and project timing for work through the agreement.“This agreement will benefit from the improvements in capital efficiency achieved in the play this year, driven by optimized infill development spacing and substantially lower drilling and completion costs,” said David Harris, Devon’s executive vice president for exploration and production, in a press release.Devon Energy was upgraded in J.P. Morgan's 2020 outlook on the oil and gas exploration and production sector, with analyst Arun Jayaram saying the company's transition to free cash flow in 2019 should support better free cash flow metrics and cash return given efficiency gains and oil-field services deflation.Jayaram also thinks U.S. shale growth is poised to disappoint, which could lift the back end of the curve.The agreement is in line with goals the company has outlined to investors throughout 2019. A December investor presentation outlines Devon's plans to develop its STACK assets through partner opportunities, lighter spaced projects, activity tailored to the environment and substantial long-term inventory optionality as part of Devon’s plan to prioritize free cash flow over volume growth.According to the presentation, Devon's STACK assets have generated $319 million in free cash flow in the last year.In its third-quarter report, Devon reported STACK production of 32,000 barrels per day of oil, 37,000 bbl/d of natural gas liquids and 317 million cubic feet per day of gas.“Exploration and production companies, this is what they do, and Devon is in a much superior position to its peers, including Chesapeake,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management.“It’s been a struggle for most folks, but the greater diversified firms, like Devon, less debt-heavy firms, like Devon, their stocks have fared better.”

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Despite “phenomenal” technological advances allowing companies like Oklahoma Gas and Electric to cut outage durations by 69%, the energy industry has a duty to push for more progress, OGE Energy Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Trauschke said Thursday.Speaking to other industry leaders gathered at the Devon Energy Center for the Energy 4.0 Forum and Awards, Trauschke said the growth of technology in recent years has led to higher customer expectations and that the company does not have the right to “rest on (the) laurels” of recent progress.Devon Energy President and CEO Dave Hager and two panels of industry professionals also spoke at the event about the necessity andthe challengesof deployingmore digital solutionsacross the power generation and oil and gas industries.“(Innovation) comes from all of us. Technology is just a means to achieve it, but that intellectual curiosity that you have in your businesses where someone’s looking at an opportunity and saying ‘How can I make this better?’ That’s what builds companies, that’s what builds communities,” Trauschke said. “The idea that we’ve all collectively had the success we’ve had is great, but we have the responsibility to add to it.”Trauschke said new digital solutionsdeployed by OG&E allow it to predict and isolate failures before they happen, saving time and money.By deploying self-correcting technology to a third of its Arkansas circuits, the utility saw a 69% decrease in outage time, while the remaining circuits had a 7% increase, Trauschke said.Not all of the company’s advancements are so sophisticated, however. As the bulbs in OG&E's 300,000 streetlights need to be replaced, the company is replacing them with bulbs that connect to its system, allowing the company to respond to those outages faster.These advancements have raised customer expectations and concerns about cybersecurity threats, so it is increasingly important for the company to look to the next advancement, Trauschke said.“We think a lot about technology and innovation in our company, but I always tell people ‘There are no eureka moments. There are no quick fixes. There are no silver bullets,'"" he said. ""I want people to always think 'What is the second and third bounce of that ball?'""Hager discussed innovations Devon has pioneered with the help of technology, such as the ability to hydraulically fracture a horizontal well. The industry has been a victim of its own success, with oil prices dropping. But the cost reduction and productivity levels achieved, in part through these advances, make him confident in the future.""This has been a technology industry for a long time and it continues to be a technology industry,” Hager said.Steve Baker, vice president of Distribution Operations for Public ServiceCo. of Oklahoma, said the utility did not collect much data beyond manual meter reads before installing automated metering infrastructure for all of its customers in 2016.Now, PSO captures 8.5 billion data points a year from those meters alone.“The real trick for us is having to take this mountain of data and transforming it into operational and decision-making information,"" Baker said. ""I think we’ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg in terms of how we use that information.""Mike Stice, dean of the University of Oklahoma Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy, said the cost of gathering the amount of data companies do now was previously prohibitively expensive, but the new challenge is using it in a useful way.The staff at Mewbourne put a lot of work into data forensics, or verifying data quality, to determine what is the most useful, and how. One problem they run into is data points being left out due to bias of the person recording it.“Lots of people talk about the tools that are giving us new insights, but the reality is the quality of the data is improving, the standardization of how we capture it is improving,"" Stice said. ""The hardest part is to go back 100 years and finding some geologist data written in different units. We actually have to put it in common terms, in new terms. There’s risk in that translation.""

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Trauschke and Devon Energy President Dave Hager. Two panel discussions will highlight digital trends in power generation and oil and gas production.Mike Ming, Oklahoma’s former secretary of energy and former general manager of General Electric's Global Research Technology Center in Oklahoma City, will moderate the discussion on oil and gas innovations, and Russell Ray, editor of The Journal Record and former chairman of POWER-GEN International and editor-in-chief of Power Engineering magazine, will moderate the discussion on digital trends in power generation.“The opportunities to exploit data and make sense of the information to trim costs, increase sales and boost efficiency are growing at breakneck speed thanks to new analytical software solutions and services,” said Ray. “Opportunity is knocking for energy producers in pursuit of increased efficiency, and this forum offers them a chance to learn more about the digital future.”Much of the discussion will focus on the gains in efficiencies, in addition to the practical steps energy companies must take to achieve a digital transformation, which is often a long and arduous journey.Panelists will discuss the opportunities to take advantage of an explosion of new data spawned by more monitors, sensors and analytical software solutions and the regulatory challenges energy producers face in implementing new digital technologies.A number of key technologies have demonstrated their market-readiness in the power generation and oil and gas sectors.These include data and analytics platforms, machine learning techniques, data management systems, the Industrial Internet of Things and field mobility systems. These once-experimental platforms are now ready for full-scale production. As a consequence, oil and gas companies and electric utilities have put more emphasis on adopting digital solutions as a way to improve performance.Panelists will also be discussing trends in cybersecurity protection and strategy.As the energy industry adds more digital technologies to power plants, the opportunities for hackers continue to grow. Every energy producer faces uniquely different circumstances related to the security of cyber assets. Ultimately, a comprehensive strategy that fills the security gaps for each operation will have to come from industry ingenuity.To attend the Energy 4.0 Forum and Awards, go to https://journalrecord.eventsmart.com/events/energy-4-0-forum-and-awards/.

The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 19 cents per share. Shares of Devon closed Thursday at $22.68, up 60 cents.Devon also raised its fourth-quarter oil production forecast by a 6% sequential quarter improvement at the midpoint to 154,000 to 160,000 barrels per day.In a strategy to become the “New Devon,” the company has been working to become a “U.S. oil growth company” through a restructuring and aggressive cost savings plan announced Feb. 19,including divesting from Canadian and Barnett Shale assets and focusing on the Delaware, STACK, Eagle Ford and Powder River basins.The company announced the $2.8 billion sale of its Canadian assets May 29 and will divest from Barnett by the end of the year.Cost savings goals included reaching $780 million in annual savings by 2021, but the company has “acted in a sense of urgency to materially improve our cost structure” and is on track to reach more than 80% of that goal by the end of the year, Devon President Dave Hager told investors in a Wednesday quarterly sales call.Hager said the company’s returns-oriented focus and strong operational execution are “translating to attractive rates of return” and, coupled with asset sales, Devon is on track to deliver on promises to reduce leverage and return capital to shareholders.“The third quarter is another one of exceptional execution for Devon across all aspects of our business,"" Hager said. ""The bold strategy we announced earlier this year to transform to a high-quality, multi-basin U.S. oil company is working and it is working quite well.""Hager said Devon’s returns delivered since January have resulted from a “highly focused development program” including improvements to drilling and completion design, reduced cycle times and increased productivity.“Our unwavering focus on what we can control is delivering compelling financial and operational results that are demonstrating a positive rate of change unique among our competitors,” Hager said.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY The Environmental Protection Agency last week said it plans to roll back Obama-era restrictions on methane emissions from oil and gas activities, a move that comes as some energy companies act to further reduce methane emissions.In June, Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy saidit is establishing a methane management program, with a goal of achieving a methane-intensity rate of 0.28% or lower by 2025. Last year, the company’s estimated methane-intensity rate was 0.32%. Devon Energy President Dave Hager said the company is ""going beyond what is required by law in pursuit of continuous improvement in environmental performance.”Meanwhile,small producers are praising the decision to loosen federal rules for methane because they cannot afford the high cost of compliance.“They want us to comply with extremely expensive equipment and procedures that will hinder us from making a profit,” Darlene S. Wallace, president of Seminole-based Columbus Oil Co., told The New York Times. “Most people who own marginal wells are rural people, and all the regulation is going to do is take a living away from a lot of people.”The Trump administration's proposed amendment to the 2016 New Source Performance Standards, announced Aug. 29, moves to rescind methane emission limits in the industry’s production and processing segments, stating they are redundant considering methane is reduced through controls to reduce volatile organic compound emissions that will remain in place.Bud Ground, director of regulatory affairs for the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, said methane controls are staying intact with VOC controls, so nothing is really being rolled back and the change would have “very little”effect on Oklahoma companies.The amendment also proposes the removal of the transmission and storage segment of the industry from the 2016 rule, citing a lack of a finding determining thesector's contribution to air pollution.Ground said the transmission and storage segments were never meant to be added to existing rules.“We’re fine with what they’re doing because they’re really not doing away with regulations,"" Ground said. ""They’re doing away with what the last administration tried to do in 2016, which was on top of what the EPA had already done in 2012.“They’re not taking anything away. The industry has done a lot to reduce VOCs.”The EPA said the proposal is an effort to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order to promote energy independence. The agency estimates the amendment would save the industry $17 million to $19 million a year.EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a press release the proposal eliminates “unnecessary” burdens on the industry, which is already incentivized to minimize leaks and has made progress in recent years.“Since 1990, natural gas production in the United States has almost doubled while methane emissions across the natural gas industry have fallen by nearly 15%. Our regulations should not stifle this innovation and progress,” Wheeler said.The proposed change will soon enter a 60-day public comment period, after which the agency will hold a public hearing.A potent greenhouse gas, methane absorbs more energy and lasts longer in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide.It is primarily produced by heat and pressure on the deeply buried remains of marine microorganisms, making up a majority of natural gas and emitted from leaks in pipelines, wells and processing equipment.In 2017, the gas made up 10% of U.S. emissions from human activity, 31% of which came from the oil and gas industry. However, regulations and industry efforts have reduced its impact with energy sector methane emissions reduced by 22.8% between 1990 and 2017, according to the EPA.Groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club have spoken against the Trump changes. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said the organization plans to fight the proposal, calling it an attempt to give the oil and gas industry a free pass for air pollution. He said Wheeler is doing bidding for friends in the industry.EDF Vice President of Energy Matt Wilson said the proposal is “irresponsible (and) dangerous” and not in line with what oil and gas leaders want.He said the industry’s methane emissions are 60% higher than estimated by the EPA.“As EPA makes clear, this proposal is an attempt to dodge the agency’s legal duty to regulate existing sources in the oil and gas sector,” Wilson said.Petroleum Alliance President Chad Warmington said in a statement the organization supports the proposal, citing U.S. methane emissions falling 24% and natural gas production increasing 19% between 2011 and 2017.""Oklahoma’s oil and natural gas industry is dedicated to reducing methane emissions, while continuing to increase our state’s oil and natural gas production. (The changes) focus on market-based solutions by removing duplicative and costly barriers to development and making it easier for operators to gain approvals for new, innovative technologies that reduce emissions,” Warmington said.Devon Energy and other energy companies have embraced efforts to reduce methane emission beyond what's required by the EPA.In 2017, One Gas Inc. participated in the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program, a voluntary EPA program aimed to highlight cost-effective emission reduction measures.The company replaced 425 miles of pipeline with better materials and began injecting gas into lower-pressure pipelines and using techniques that lower line pressure before maintenance.As a result, One Gas reduced operational emissions by 7.9% across all service areas since 2011 which it compared to removing 1,000 passenger vehicles from the road a year.The American Petroleum Institute and Republican U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma have also expressed support for the proposal. Inhofe said current regulations were made with little consideration of the impact on the law or economy.“As I said when it was first proposed, the old methane rule had no environmental benefit and created needless costs while hindering economic growth,” Inhofe said. “Methane emissions have continued to decrease by voluntary actions initiated by industry, all while oil and gas production has skyrocketed. With this kind of progress, why would regulation be necessary?”

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY - Almost half of 33 science, technology, engineering and mathematics centers being installed in Oklahoma City elementary schools were funded directly by the oil and gas industry, according to the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board.The Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation and the Foundation for Oklahoma City Public Schools announced in June a partnership to build the centers in all of the district’s elementary schools. The district secured sponsors and the RipkenFoundation secured contracts for and provided teacher training, curriculum and supplies for the centers.Between OERB, Ascent Resources, Chesapeake Energy, Devon Energy, Kimray and Reign Capital Holdings, 15 STEM centers and $450,000 of the project were sponsored by the industry.Each center cost $30,000, with the project totaling $990,000.OERB Communications Director Dara McBee said STEM education has become increasingly important for all industries as technology has advanced, becoming more integrated in operations.McBee said the percentage of funding for the centers that came from the oil and gas industry was not surprising, considering the increase of STEM-focused jobs.“The industry realized the importance of that (education) for getting new employees, because it’s becoming a more and more STEM-related industry. It’s a future workforce. (It continues) that pipeline of educated workers in our industry, keeping our kids here in Oklahoma and to get them excited about science and math at an early age,” McBee said.“That will benefit our industry and it will certainly benefit Oklahoma as a whole.”The centers are being constructed in existing space and the Ripken Foundation will furnish them and provide tools such as 3D printers, programmable robots, kits to build simple circuits and computers.The foundation will also train a coordinator from each school to work as a liaison and ensure consistent use of the centers.In a ceremony Aug. 27, the RipkenFoundation and community officials will celebrate the grand opening of all 33 centers with a ribbon-cutting at Mark Twain Elementary School.Speakers will include Cal Ripken Jr., OKCPS Superintendent Sean McDaniel, Devon Energy CEO Dave Hager, OERB Chairman Mike McDonald, Mark Twain Principal Sandy Phillips and Foundation for OKCPS President Mary Mlon.The STEM center inside Mark Twain, and two nearby, were worked by more than 200 volunteers July 31 from Devon and Home Depot.Mlon said the oil and gas industry “played a key roll” in the success of the installation of the STEM centers.“The opportunities being provided to the students of Oklahoma City Public Schoolsthrough the(oil and gas) industry’s generous support are nothing short of transformational,” Mlon said.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Oil and gas producer Devon Energy exceeded expectations in the second quarter, earning $495 million, or $1.19 per share, and raised its forecast for oil production in 2019.That compares to a loss of $425 million, or 83 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.The improvements were helped by lower expenses and increased production from its Delaware Basin assets, the company said.Devon President Dave Hager said reducing capital costs through lower drilling and completion, lower lease operating expenses and lower general and administrative expenses helped put the company on track to achieve 70% of its three-year savings goal in the first year.“What Devon is doing is really maximizing the capital efficiency that we have,"" Hager said in an interview. ""All companies are doing that right now. We are being mindful to keep our capital expenses at a level that we generate free cash flow each year that is available for dividends or share repurchases.""The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 36 cents per share. The oil and gas exploration company posted revenue of $1.92 billion in the period.“All in all it was an outstanding operational quarter in the face of a difficult price environment for natural gas and natural gas liquids,” Hager said.Production from the Delaware Basin increased 58% to 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter,as total expenses fell 30% to $1.68 billion in the quarter. In addition, the company's realized oil prices averaged $56.68 per barrel, up 5% versus the same period last year.Shares of Devon closed at $24.22 Tuesday, up 16 cents but well below its 52-week high of $44.34.Longbow Asset Management Chief Executive Officer Jake Dollarhide said the decline is not surprising, considering investors focus more on negative results than positive ones and that the price of oil closed Tuesday at $53.63.“It’s a tough time to be in oil and gas,"" Dollarhide said. ""There’s not a lot oil and gas companies can do right now to get the attention of Wall Street.""The company also reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $627 million.In an ongoing shift away from capital expenditures, the company reported second-quarter capital spending of $478 million, 9% below midpoint guidance, leading it to lower its 2019 exploration and production capital investment expectations by $50 million.The company announced the $2.8 billion sale of its Canadian assets May 29 and is still planningto divestits Barnett Shale gas assets.Devon also reported plans to relocate $50 million of its STACK capital to the Delaware and Powder River basins.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

| Jump to first hitThe promise of the Permian is shrinking.
Producers in the nation's oilrich shale basins are dialing back growth plans in the face of a growing panoply of problems that's killing returns and keeping skeptical investors at bay.
The constraints are manifold: pipeline limits, reduced flow from wells drilled too close together, low natural gas prices and high land costs. But the most consequential is that shale-well production falls off at such a high rate - as much as 70 per cent in the first year - that you need to keep spending cash on new wells just to maintain output.
In the five years since oil fell below $30 a barrel from more than $100, a resilient shale industry has established the U.S. as the world's top oil producer. Now, cracks are opening in that survival tale, with companies ranging from EOG Resources Inc. to tiny Laredo Petroleum Inc. dropping their 2019 growth rates by three percentage points to more than 40 below last year's gains.
""You're having to spend more and more every year to grow at a faster rate,"" said Noah Barrett, an energy analyst at Janus Henderson, in a telephone interview. ""Companies routinely spent 120 to 130 per cent of their cash flow never generating positive cash flow or earnings.""
In the early years, Wall Street had been happy to fund shale growth, framing the budding sector as a young, technology-driven industry, ripe for future returns. But as the shale fields aged, the returns never came and shareholders are now pushing for payback at the expense of additional oil growth.
The Permian has been the world's fastest-growing major oil region over the past two years, growing 72 per cent to 4.2 million barrels a day. But the pace of that growth is under threat as producers bow to investor demands to stop spending money.
Most of the independent producers cut their capital budgets after oil prices slipped at the end of last year. While companies including Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp. have bolstered buybacks, investors warn there's a long road ahead to recovery.
""They've been burned so many times in the past that there's deserved skepticism"" toward energy stocks, according to Barrett, whose firm manages $328 billion. ""Just when we get progress, managements have short memories and start spending capital in an undisciplined manner.""
The smallest companies have been among the hardest hit.
Times should be good for Legacy Reserves Inc. and Approach Resources Inc., two small producers working in the oil-rich Permian. Crude prices are edging up, and big drillers want to expand there. Yet they've lost 99 per cent and 87 per cent of their market value in the past year, and Legacy last month filed for Chapter 11 protection.
But it's not just the minnows that are struggling. Bigger producers, including Parsley Energy Inc., QEP Resources Inc., Centennial Resource Development Inc., SM Energy Co. and Cimarex Energy Co. have all lost between 42 per cent and 59 per cent of their market value in the past year. Meanwhile, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, is only down 14 per cent.
For the biggest companies - majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. - battling decline rates means drilling so many wells that they create a long, low-decline tail of production that makes money for years with little reinvestment. But that takes time and a lot of money, a luxury not available to many independent players.
Stock offerings last year were the lowest since at least 2006 and were down more than 60 per cent versus 2017. With public capital harder to come by, producers including Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Devon Energy Corp. and Apache Corp. have sold off less-important acreage as they seek to tap their most productive acreage.
Other producers are tapping private capital to help drill wells outside of their regular capital expenditure program. One private equity firm puts the number of so-called DrillCo deals at more than $5 billion since mid-2015.
In those arrangements, private equity investors pay to drill certain areas outside a producer's budget. Once oil flows, the buyout firm receives the majority of the cash flow, but when costs are repaid and investors earn a pre-agreed profit, revenues revert to the producer.
The strategies may be different but the goal's the same: ""It's really just designed to accelerate this free cash flow generation, and get these companies to try to prove earlier to investors that they are good businesses,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, which handles energy-related assets.
Such measures mean the U.S. will continue to see shale production, but the explosive surges of the past may be over, according to Janus's Barrett. ""U.S. production in absolute terms will continue to grow,"" he said. ""But the pace of production increases will slow.""

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy has joined a growing number of energy companies that have committed to reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations.The Oklahoma City-based energy giant said Monday it is establishing a methane management program, with a goal of achieving a methane-intensity rate of 0.28% or lower by 2025. Last year, the company’s estimated methane-intensity rate was 0.32%.Methane intensity is measured based on the level of emissions from oil and gas production as a percentage of oil and gas produced.“By continuing to operate responsibly and increasing our focus on leak detection and repair, we’re confident we can meet this ambitious target,” Devon President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager said in a statement. “The actions we’re taking reaffirm our commitment to responsible production operations, going beyond what is required by law in pursuit of continuous improvement in environmental performance.”Methane is many times more potent than carbon dioxide because it contains more heat. Although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is substantially less than carbon dioxide, methane packs a bigger punch. What’s more, the amount of methane in the atmosphere is growing, and the production of fossil fuels has been identified as a big source, along with agriculture.Other energy companies, including Exxon Mobil, Exelon, EOG Resources and EQT, have recently established similar programs to reduce methane emissions and intensity rates. The changes, in some cases, were borne from shareholder resolutions calling for better methane management.Devon said increased leak detection and repair will be an important part of its plan to achieve a lower intensity rate. Such work will be expanded into areas where leak detection and repair are not required by state or federal regulation, the company said.“Devon has trained personnel whose primary focus is conducting infrared camera surveys and ensuring that any necessary repairs are successful,” the company said in a press release. “The data collected through this program will allow Devon to establish best management practices and identify technology, equipment and materials for improved performance.”Last year, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a coalition of global energy companies, established a goal of reducing average methane intensity by at least 20% by 2025. The goal was deemed a significant threshold in the industry’s effort tolimit climate change.During the first quarter,Devon's U.S. assets produced, on average, 308,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, with oil and liquids making up almost 70% of total volumes. Light-oil production averaged 138,000 barrels per day, up 24%compared with the same quarter last year.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Devon Energy announced Wednesday an agreement to sell its Canadian business to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. for $2.8 billion and use the profits for debt reduction. Devon had $5.8 billion of debt at the end of the first quarter.In February, the company announced plans to spin off or sell its Canadian and Barnett Shale assets and lay off about 200 people, to focus on oil growth from wells in U.S. shale fields.Devon is advancing divestiture in Barnett Shale gas assets and will exit by the end of 2019, according to the press release.The agreement withCNR is expected to closeJune 27.It includes 1.5 million acres of land, 1 million of which are undeveloped, and heavy oil assets predominantly located in Alberta, with an average net production of 113,000 oil equivalent barrels in the first quarter.In 2018, the assets held proved reserves of 409 million barrels of oil and totaled $236 million in field-level cash flow, excluding overhead costs.CNR said it will also absorb 735 Devon employees. It's not clear how many of those employees work in Oklahoma City. Calls and emails requesting more information from CNR were not immediately returned late Wednesday.""I don’t have an exact number, but the vast majority of employees are based in Canada, not OKC,"" John Porretto, Devon's corporate communications director, said in an email to The Journal Record.In a press release, Devon President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager thanked the employees for their work, saying they are transitioning to a “top-tier company.”“The sale of Canada is an important step in executing Devon’s transformation to a U.S. oil growth business,"" Hager said in the release. ""This transaction creates value for our shareholders by achieving a clean and timely exit from Canada, while accelerating efforts to focus exclusively on our high-return U.S. oil portfolio.""Longbow Asset Management Chief Executive Officer Jake Dollarhide said the sale is part of an ongoing industry downturn, but focusing on more centrally located assets may help Devon be more streamlined and competitive when the prices improve.“Highly leveraged companies with a lot of debt and a lot of interest payments are being forced to downsize,"" he said. ""Devon is powerful as a company and is a symbol to the state as they can be, given the Devon Tower looming over Oklahoma City. No company is immune to commodity prices in this environment.”Canadian Natural Resources President Tim McKay said in a press release the assets give the company new opportunities to add value.The company’s executive vice chairman, Steve Laut, said in a press release the productive capacity added by the sale will allow the company to increase production volumes at attractive economics.“This acquisition is a great fit for Canadian Natural resulting in a win for both parties and provides further balance to our diverse portfolio,"" Laut said. ""The ongoing opportunity toleverage technology, innovation and drive synergies is further enhanced through the economies of scale gained.""

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY Executives of Devon Energy, Oklahoma Gas and Electric and other companies on Thursday discussed technology'seffect on the production and delivery of electricity, oil and natural gas at the Oklahoma State University Energy Conference in Oklahoma City.Devon Energy President and Chief Executive Officer Dave Hager said he has experienced several phases of technology advancements that have made oil and gas more profitable and are “really transforming our operations.”""Through my full career, I don’t think I’ve ever been in a situation to say ‘this business is easy. It’s not hard to find oil and gas, it’s not hard to produce oil and gas for profit,’"" Hager said. ""You’re always facing challenges of one type or another. Technology has always driven changes in this business.""Hagersaid Devon has a decision support system, including control rooms feeding information of every function on all of the company’s rigs live, allowing them to monitor hydraulic fracturing and flowback operations at all times.This remote monitoring allows operators to go directly to wells that need assistance instead of driving to well sites blindly, as they did previously.Devon also has software capable of predicting equipment failure, allowing the company to dopreventive maintenance,which reduces pump downtime, he said. Geosteering,the act of adjusting the borehole position on the fly to reach one or more geological targets, has also improved, ushering in a phase of Shale 2.0, a big-data revolution in America's shale oil fields.“We are within zone now 95% of the time to a 10-foot vertical,"" Hager said. ""Obviously, the importance of that is when you stay in the right zone, you make better wells. It’s really critical you stay in the right zone.""OG&E Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sean Trauschke said technology has spawned “a whole new world from the customer standpoint,” creating the ability to control lights and room temperature from a cellphone, among other things.At the same time, the proliferation of digital technologies has also increased the possibility of cyberattacks, he said.""Technology has enabled many things and energy is no exception,"" Trauschke said. ""With all of this technology comes a great responsibility that you manage your business and you understand the implications of what really could happen.""Warwick Energy Group Chief Executive Officer Kate Richard and Chris Buie, director of data science and strategic initiatives, discussed the use of big data large amounts of unstructured data that has been untapped by most companies that could change things for the industry.“There is this common perception (in Silicon Valley) that oil and gas is this untouched sector where big data has not been disruptive yet,” Richard said.She said traditional data allows companies to analyze past performance, but still-developing technologies, such as artificial intelligence, that allow companies to harness and sort big data make it possible to predict future performance.Buie compared data to oil, which needs to be extracted and refined to be usable.""(Untapped data) is costing you money,"" Buie said. ""There’s value in that, but if you’re not actually extracting that value, you have a net loss and it’s holding you back.""

| Jump to first hitIn 2023, crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) companies increased spending on mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to $234 billion, the most in real 2023 dollars since 2012. Recent dealmaking marks a return to the previous trend of consolidation among oil companies in the United States after transactions declined amid significant oil market volatility in 2020 and 2022. Spending on M&A includes both corporate M&A and asset acquisitions. Corporate M&A involves one company merging or acquiring another company. Asset acquisition is when one owner purchases an asset from another owner. Corporate M&A was 82% of total announced spending, due in large part to two in-progress deals: ExxonMobil's announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources for $64.5 billion and Chevron's announced acquisition of Hess Corporation for $60 billion. These deals are the largest by value in real terms since Occidental Petroleum Corporation acquired Anadarko Petroleum Corporation for a total acquisition cost of $55 billion in 2019.Corporate M&A and asset acquisitions, such as acreage sales, can be attractive for both buyers and sellers. Buyers can purchase proved reserves instead of using capital expenditures on exploration and development that might not generate profitable assets. Some companies may also want to diversify their portfolios or purchase acreage that geographically complements their existing portfolios, which can lead to lower costs and greater production efficiency. Sellers may see selling property or merging with companies as beneficial for shareholders or, in some cases, may seek out buyers as a way to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings and improve balance sheets.One result of recent consolidation activity is larger companies that own more producing assets. Chevron is currently the largest crude oil and natural gas liquids (NGL) producer in the United States, accounting for 5% of the U.S. total with average production of just over 1.0 million barrels per day (b/d) in the third quarter of 2023 (3Q23). If Chevron successfully acquires Hess Corporation, it could increase Chevron's share of U.S production to 6% (just over 1.2 million b/d), based on 3Q23 data. Similarly, ExxonMobil, the fourth-largest crude oil and NGL producer in the United States, has the potential to increase its production to nearly 7% of total U.S. production (from about 750,000 b/d to 1.3 million b/d) if it successfully acquires Pioneer Natural Resources. Barring any other large production or asset ownership changes, recent M&A could make ExxonMobil the largest crude oil and NGL producer in the United States.ExxonMobil's goals for the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources include increasing the company's footprint in the Permian Basin in West Texas, realizing advantages from combining ExxonMobil's and Pioneer's adjoining acreage, and reducing overall risk in its production portfolio by increasing its domestic crude oil production, based on public statements. ExxonMobil expects that combining its 570,000 net acres in the Delaware and Midland Basins-both sub-basins of the Permian Basin-with Pioneer's more than 850,000 net acres in the Midland Basin will result in an estimated 16 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) worth of reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian has been the main source of increasing crude oil production in the United States in recent years, and we expect it to continue to be a major source for production growth in the United States going forward.Public statements suggest Chevron's primary goal for acquiring Hess Corporation is to gain access to the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana. The Stabroek Block is the world's largest oil discovery in the last 10 years; Chevron estimates the block has more than 11 billion BOE of recoverable resources. Hess owns a 30% stake in the Stabroek Block, ExxonMobil owns 45%, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation owns 25%. ExxonMobil filed an arbitration claim to block Chevron's acquisition of Hess's Stabroek Block stake, claiming a right to first refusal of a sale. The outcome of the claim could affect whether the acquisition is completed or not. Other recent notable deals include:- Diamondback Energy announced it will merge with Endeavor Energy for a total transaction cost of $26 billion, which is the total cost for Diamondback Energy to acquire all Endeavor Energy shares, its net debt, and transaction costs from the merger. The combined company has the potential to be the third-largest oil and natural gas producer in the Permian Basin, behind ExxonMobil and Chevron.- Occidental Petroleum Corporation announced it will acquire CrownRock L.P. for a total acquisition cost of $12 billion. Occidental, which produced about 1.2 million BOE per day (BOE/d) of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas in 3Q23, expects to add 170,000 BOE/d of production in 2024 from CrownRock's assets in the Midland Basin.- Chesapeake Energy announced it will merge with Southwestern Energy for a total transaction cost of $11.5 billion, which is the total cost for Chesapeake Energy to acquire all Southwestern Energy shares, its net debt, and transaction costs from the merger. The combined company, which will assume a new name at closing, could become the largest natural gas producer in the United States.- Chevron acquired PDC Energy, Inc., for a total acquisition cost of $7.6 billion in August 2023. Prior to acquisition, PDC Energy produced 178,000 b/d of crude oil and NGL in 2Q23, mainly from assets in the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado.- ExxonMobil acquired Denbury, Inc., for a total acquisition cost of $4.9 billion in November 2023. The deal provides ExxonMobil with the largest CO2 pipeline network in the United States and 10 onshore sequestration sites used for carbon capture and storage.- APA Corporation announced it will acquire Callon Petroleum Company for a total acquisition cost of $4.5 billion. In 3Q23, APA Corporation produced 150,000 b/d of crude oil and NGL in the United States, and Callon Petroleum Company produced 81,000 b/d. Both companies operate primarily in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.Principal contributor: Alex De Keyserling(U.S. Energy Information Administration)"

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Is the massive Chevron-Hess oil deal slip-sliding away?
Hedge funds that specialize in merger arbitrage are steering clear of a tie-up set to close by the end of June. That created a potential ""heads I win, tails I don't lose very much"" situation for people brave enough to invest in shares of the target. Chevron said in October that it would pay $53 billion in stock for Hess. The deal valued Hess at $171 a share at the time and had been approved beforehand by both companies' boards. Unfortunately, a rival could play spoiler.
Exxon Mobil had just set the largest oil-and-gas deal in decades weeks earlier by agreeing to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. Chevron had its deal for Anadarko snatched away years earlier by Occidental and may have been willing to take a risk.
The gamble it took is that Exxon operates and owns 45% of the largest oil discovery in years, the Stabroek block in the waters off Guyana. Hess's 30% stake is its most-valuable asset. Now Exxon says the terms of the agreement it originally signed with Shell, which sold its stake to Hess, allow it a right of first refusal for the stake. Chevron disagrees that the deal triggers that right. Spokesman Braden Reddall wrote in an email Thursday that Chevron is ""fully committed to the transaction"" and that the company is confident it will close.
The stock market isn't. At the deal's original value there is a 19% gap between Hess's share price, plus two more dividend payments Hess shareholders could receive by the end of June, and the offer. That is 74%, annualized, if it closes on time. At Chevron's current, lower, share price, that annualized gain would be 25%. The actual return might be somewhere in between, since Chevron's shares might have suffered a bit due to the uncertainty.
The odds of the deal closing, or the costs to merger arbitragers if it is delayed by a contract arbitration claim Exxon filed Wednesday, aren't the only things to consider for Hess shareholders. Chevron says that a failure of the deal would trigger a $1.715 billion termination payment to it from Hess. Reddall said in a later email that the agreement with Hess ""does not provide for any break fees relating to the ROFR."" A Hess spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
The deal's closing date could be extended to October 2025 to allow for arbitration, according to Chevron's filings.
Clearly there were doubts from the outset. Hess shares dropped the day the deal was announced and are now 11% lower, which is twice the drop of a basket of oil-and-gas exploration companies. That fully accounts for the value of the termination fee. It might be worth owning Hess shares since the worst-case scenario appears priced in.
Or maybe it isn't: The nightmare scenario would be a Venezuelan takeover of parts of Guyana. Its neighbor, with a large, Russian- and Iranian-supplied military, moved troops to their common border last month and would easily overwhelm the former British colony's small defense force. Venezuela says it conducted a referendum last year that approved annexation. Try hedging that.

Exxon Mobil has filed for arbitration to protect what it says is its right to pre-empt Chevron's bid for a stake in a prolific oil project off Guyana, escalating a dispute that could torpedo Chevron's $53 billion deal for Hess.
Chevron last week warned investors that Exxon and China's Cnooc say they have the right to counter Chevron's offer for Hess's stake in the Guyana project, which Exxon operates and is one of the largest oil finds in years. Chevron said arbitration could be pursued in the event that talks between the companies fell apart.
Exxon senior vice president Neil Chapman said Wednesday that Exxon had filed that day for arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.
He said Exxon had taken tremendous exploration, financial and commercial risks developing the South American oil project, and that it had a responsibility to shareholders to ensure it realizes the value that it had created in Guyana.
""It would be incomprehensible for us to say, 'Well, we're not going to look at that value. We're just going to let the transaction proceed,'"" he said during a chat at Morgan Stanley's Energy & Power Conference in New York, according to a transcript of his comments.
Much of the value in Chevron's $53 billion all-stock acquisition of Hess proposed last year was tied to the smaller New York oil company's 30% stake in the drilling consortium in Guyanese waters. The partnership has expanded oil production far faster than most offshore oil projects and expects to pump over a million barrels a day in coming years.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall has said Chevron and Hess don't believe a right of first refusal applies to the Hess deal. He said in a statement Wednesday that Chevron remains fully committed to the transaction and is confident in its position.
A Hess spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Cnooc didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The dispute boils down to the terms of a joint operating agreement, or JOA, signed more than a decade ago, which governs the consortium. Hess had entered the JOA in 2014 when it purchased its stake from Shell. Some JOAs allow existing partners, like Exxon, to participate in ownership changes, and pre-empt an offer for an ownership stake with an offer of their own.
""We are confident in our reading of the contract we, with our initial partners, helped write and that Hess agreed to when they entered the JOA,"" an Exxon spokeswoman said Wednesday.
Exxon has a 45% share in the Guyana oil project and Cnooc owns the remaining 25%.

Chevron warned investors Monday that Exxon Mobil and China's Cnooc are asserting they have a right to pre-empt the company's bid for a stake in a prolific oil project off Guyana, an emerging dispute that could derail Chevron's megadeal for Hess.
Chevron said in a regulatory filing that Exxon and Cnooc say they have the right to counter Chevron's offer for Hess's stake in the Guyana project, which Exxon operates and is one of the largest oil finds in years. Chevron warned investors it may not complete its purchase of Hess ""within the time frame the company anticipates or at all.""
Much of the value in Chevron's $53 billion all-stock acquisition of Hess proposed last year was tied to the smaller New York oil company's 30% stake in an Exxon-led drilling consortium in Guyanese waters. The partnership has expanded oil production far faster than most offshore oil projects and expects to pump over 1 million barrels a day in coming years.
The development is a potential blow to Chevron's largest acquisition in years, though it isn't clear if Exxon and Cnooc will make a counteroffer. At this point, they are only asserting it is their right to do so.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said Chevron and Hess don't believe a right of first refusal applies to the Hess deal. Chevron said the companies have engaged in ""constructive discussions,"" and though Chevron said the deal might fall apart, it believes the talks will ""result in an outcome"" that wouldn't delay or prevent the deal.
""We are fully committed to the transaction,"" Reddall said. ""There is no possible scenario in which Exxon or Cnooc could acquire Hess's interest in Guyana as a result of the Chevron-Hess transaction.""
If the talks fall apart, Chevron said in a regulatory filing, it or Hess could choose to have Hess's Guyana subsidiary pursue arbitration. A Hess spokeswoman referred inquiries to Chevron, and Cnooc didn't respond to a request for comment.
The dispute boils down to the terms of a joint operating agreement, or JOA, signed more than a decade ago, which governs the consortium. Hess had entered the JOA in 2014 when it purchased its stake from Shell. Some JOAs allow existing partners, like Exxon, to participate in ownership changes and pre-empt an offer for an ownership stake with an offer of their own.
Exxon spokeswoman Emily Mir said the conversations with Hess and Chevron are set to continue, and that the company is working with the Guyanese government on the matter.
""We owe it to our investors and partners to consider our pre-emption rights,"" Mir said. Exxon is trying ""to ensure we preserve our right to realize the significant value we've created"" in Guyana. Exxon didn't say whether it will make its own offer for Hess's stake.
The exact terms of the JOA weren't immediately clear, including whether pre-emption rights exist or whether Chevron or others would have the right to make another offer.
Exxon has a 45% share in the Guyana oil project and Cnooc owns the remaining 25%.
The clash with Exxon is a setback for Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth, who late last year disclosed delays and cost overruns for a massive oil project in Kazakhstan, as well as shareholder returns that have recently underperformed rival Exxon.
The California oil giant's attempt to join the jungle-covered South American country's oil boom has coincided with a retreat by the large American oil companies to the Western Hemisphere as global conflicts abound. Exxon lost its stake in a major Russian project following the Ukraine war.
Exxon and Chevron have sold off billions in assets in Asia and Africa in recent years, underscoring the growing importance of the U.S. shale plays and South America. Chevron last year began pumping oil in Venezuela again as the Biden administration eased sanctions. It helped to restore production there to faster growth than the market anticipated. It also is investing in Argentina's shale and is exploring for oil and gas off Suriname, near Guyana.
In recent months, Venezuela's President Nicholas Maduro has escalated its military presence near its border with Guyana, a country of 800,000 with little means of defense.
Exxon has assumed the lion's share of the risk in the Guyana project, drilling there for years before large amounts of oil were discovered. Exxon and its partners continue to drill for additional oil finds, and the project's value could increase substantially. Exxon estimates the Guyana project to house nearly 11 billion barrels of oil and gas.

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Chevron's $53 billion proposed deal to buy Hess, the second-biggest oil megamerger this year.
Chevron and Hess said Friday the antitrust enforcer is seeking additional information about the merger, a move signaling the commission is reviewing whether the deal could be anticompetitive under U.S. law.
The companies' disclosure comes on the heels of another new FTC merger investigation, this one into Exxon Mobil's $59.5 billion all-stock deal to scoop up Pioneer Natural Resources. It would be the largest oil-and-gas transaction since Exxon's $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s.
Chevron's purchase of Hess would make the oil major a partner in an Exxon-led consortium developing a generational oil find in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% stake. Chevron would also acquire assets in North Dakota's Bakken Shale, where Hess is one of dozens of operators.
Braden Reddall, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company is working productively with the commission and will respond to its request ""in a timely manner to advance a successful close of the transaction.""
The oil-and-gas assets owned by Chevron and Hess have little overlap compared with the Exxon-Pioneer tie-up. That deal would make Exxon the largest operator by far in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the country's most active oil field. Exxon has noted their combined production would only make up about 3% of the world's daily output, and 5% of U.S. oil-and-gas production.
The commission and the Justice Department typically probe about 2% to 3% of deals that are reported to the government. Those agencies can take companies to court to try to block a merger.
Agencies with antitrust authority have rarely taken action against oil-and-gas producers, often taking the view they compete in a global market. Some oil executives and deal makers had anticipated a recent series of acquisitions would draw antitrust scrutiny, but have said they saw little chance the FTC would prevail in court if it pursued legal action.
Under the Biden administration, the commission has become more active in taking action against large mergers, challenging 11 deals in court. Five deals were canceled after the FTC filed lawsuits to block them.
But the commission has lost some antitrust court challenges against large companies such as Microsoft, which a judge allowed this summer to purchase Activision Blizzard for $75 billion.

In the past month, two megadeals have been launched in the oil and gas industry: the announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources by ExxonMobil and Chevron's planned takeover of Hess.
In the Pioneer deal, Exxon will become the dominant operator in the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the US. And in acquiring Hess, Chevron will become one of the largest producers in the Bakken Formation (and gains a foothold in Guyana where Exxon already has a leading presence).
Both acquisitions were accompanied by triumphal announcements regarding the long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand, including Chevron's chief executive challenging the International Energy Agency's projections of a peak in fossil fuel demand in the next decade.
Yet the rationale for these transactions can be squared with either view of oil demand. For Exxon, in particular, expansion in the Permian offers a path to profitability even in significantly lower long-term fossil fuel demand scenarios, with estimated production costs of approximately $35 a barrel.
Permian shale patch production, which has a typically short cycle of development and exploitation, also offers the ability to flex production up and down more easily in response to changes in demand.
Megaprojects, by contrast, can take up to a decade to start producing and even longer to start generating a return.
This stands in marked contrast to Exxon's stance on capital allocation a couple of years ago, when I led a campaign with my former colleagues at Engine No. 1 to replace members of the oil group's board.
The company at that point had for years disregarded the market's preference for focusing on value over volumes ? and was instead setting capital expenditure levels by reference to market share rather than expected returns.
As a result, its shares had underperformed those of its peers for years, even before Covid-19. In fact, Exxon had spent so heavily that at the start of 2020, the estimated oil price required for its projects to break even was close to $90 ? almost 50 per cent higher than its closest peers, including Chevron.
At the time, there were also no independent directors with outside energy experience. This is why investors were open to change. They were under no illusion that Exxon would stop investing in oil and gas; in fact, in our first letter we noted ? just as Exxon's chief executive did in announcing the Pioneer deal ? that oil and gas companies must spend to offset natural decline rates.
But we also argued that Exxon should spend more intelligently to account for long-term demand uncertainty.
Specifically, we called for focusing on projects that would deliver a rate of return well above the company's cost of capital under a wider variety of longterm demand scenarios and we highlighted the Permian Basin ? as well as Guyana ? as meeting that criterion.
This is why, despite the public debate about the direction and speed of the energy transition, the real focus for oil and gas companies will continue to be around capital allocation in a time of uncertainty.
Exxon and Chevron may be right that oil and gas demand will grow far beyond the expectations of the IEA or the hopes of citizens wishing to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Recent events include a rise in interest rates and supply chain issues that have dented the economics of renewables while there's been minimal progress at the COP26 and 27 summits on climate change and, most likely, COP28, starting later this month in Dubai.
Exxon is also not wrong when it says it cannot move faster than the pace of the energy transition (leaving aside the matter of its historical role in slowing this transition), as other producers would simply pick up the slack.
Still, I believe that long-term investors continue to prefer Exxon to eschew a strategy of chasing market share without sufficient regard to returns, instead focusing on lower cost projects offering greater flexibility if the pace of the energy transition increases over time.
The stock market certainly does, with Exxon outperforming Chevron substantially since the former embraced a more disciplined capital allocation strategy during the proxy campaign.
With this acquisition, Exxon enhances its flexibility for the future.
However, it will be up to investors to again hold the company accountable should it return to a strategy rejected not just by those focused on climate change but those focused solely on shareholder returns as well.

One of the first things you notice when entering the Hess Tower in downtown Houston is the original forest-green truck that Leon Hess drove around New Jersey nearly a century ago to deliver fuel.
Now, the Hess name is set to disappear from the ranks of the world's prominent oil companies. Chevron last Monday said it would acquire the family company for $53 billion, concluding a 90-year saga bookended by the gruff founding father and his gregarious son, current Chief Executive John Hess.
The merger marks the end of an era as Hess was the last major U.S. oil company controlled by a single family. The enterprise was a throwback to the great family dynasties that propelled American industry, including the Rockefellers and the Gettys, and the luxury and glamour that accompanied them.
The Hesses transcended plebeian roots to ensconce themselves in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Their oil empire afforded them the perks of outrageous wealth: private jets, Bahamian vacations, luxury real estate and, for a time, owning the New York Jets.
The dynasty has loomed large over the oil patch since 1933, when Leon Hess got tired of lugging bags of coal and started distributing heating oil. Walking in the footsteps of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, he built a fuel-marketing business that covered the East Coast with Hess-branded gas stations. He also ran what was once the world's largest refinery.
In the following decades, the company dotted North Dakota with rigs during the shale boom, drilled in the Gulf of Mexico and helped uncover one of the biggest oil fields in South America.
John Hess, 69, had hoped for his son Michael to take over the business as recently as 2013, but at some point dropped those plans, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael was cultivating other interests beyond the family business and pursuing a career in finance at top firms. Recently, the CEO hadn't anointed a successor and was prepared to remain at the helm of the company for years.
Michael Hess couldn't be reached for comment.
In 2013, hedge fund Elliott Management pushed for a board overhaul and a split of Hess into an international and a domestic company, among other changes. It eventually reached a settlement that saw Hess appoint three Elliott nominees on its board and John Hess relinquish his chairmanship -- a heavy price to pay for the dynasty's survival.
""Many people would say, 'Oh, well, they won't want to sell their business because that's the Hess name, it's the Hess company,'"" Marc Lipschultz, a director on the company's board, said of Hess's deal with Chevron. ""He said, 'OK, it's the right strategic thing to do.'""
John Hess told employees last week that the merger would allow Hess to combine its growing oil resources with Chevron's sturdy balance sheet and diverse assets.
""My father always believed that there was something noble about a business that could create jobs for people,"" he said during a companywide meeting. ""I just want you to know a lot of thought has gone into this.""
Similar to the Rockefellers, the Hesses suffered near-fatal business wounds over the years and decided to spin off their prized retail segment. But they maintained a 9.5% stake in the company, the value of which has soared to more than $4 billion -- close to double what it was a decade ago.
The family's influence radiated from the East Coast, where around Christmastime loyal fans lined up at Hess gas stations to buy the company-branded toy trucks. The toys are held in special reverence by the family: John Hess is personally involved in the design of each new model, as his father was.
By age 7, John Hess was being groomed for succession, accompanying his father to foreign oil outposts. During that period, Leon Hess built what became the world's largest refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands and merged the business with Amerada Petroleum to form Amerada Hess.
The elder Hess wildcatted in search of oil from Alaska to the North Sea, rubbing shoulders with heads of state as he built his empire. To a guest visiting his art-filled Manhattan apartment, he reportedly once showed a Rolodex card with the phone number of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini on it.
A press-shy businessman, Leon Hess became a celebrity to New Yorkers as the owner of the Jets. He became a partial owner of the football team in 1963 before buying it outright in 1984. Despite the franchise's years of mediocrity, his devotion remained intact. On Thanksgiving Day, the tycoon would attend practice in a folding chair, wearing a knitted green Jets hat.
In 1995, 40-year-old John Hess took over as CEO. He had learned the business from the ground up, pumping gas at 16 and joining the board in his early 20s. He studied at Harvard, where he was eager to learn about oil and geopolitics, said Daniel Yergin, the vice chairman of S&P Global, who met him during a seminar on Middle Eastern oil there.
""He wasn't ghosting through, he was there to learn about this stuff,"" said Yergin, an energy historian. Years later, Yergin would attend energy conferences alongside the oilman and watch as he conversed with Middle Eastern ministers in Arabic, which Hess speaks fluently.
Under John Hess's leadership, the company forayed into new offshore frontiers and started drilling into shale-rock formations in North Dakota. But it suffered some costly misses in Indonesia, Brazil and Texas, and analysts said the company was spreading itself thin. Hess's lagging share price gave an opening to activist investor Elliott Management.
After Elliott's intervention in 2013, Hess shed more than $10 billion worth of assets -- including its gas stations -- to raise cash and become a nimbler player focused on a few large oil-and-gas projects, such as North Dakota's Bakken Shale.
John Hess got a reprieve in 2015, when Exxon announced an oil discovery off the shores of Guyana, in South America. Hess had staked a 30% interest in the exploration project, which was later estimated to hold about 11 billion barrels of oil and gas, the largest modern oil find.
But the share price languished and Elliott came charging back in 2017, saying the company should get leaner and buy back more stock. It sought to oust John Hess, saying he had amassed a two-decade record of middling performance. Hess headed off a potentially mortal proxy fight when the company agreed to purchase additional shares.
In the years since, the company's stock skyrocketed as Guyana has taken off, vindicating the CEO's strategy to funnel cash from its Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia assets to grow in the Bakken and develop the offshore enterprise. Hess's stock hit a record around $166 in the days before the deal.
John Hess had previously discussed a potential tie-up with Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, but Hess's valuation wasn't high enough for a deal to happen, people close to him said. Talks picked up pace in the last six months, leading to an agreement for Chevron to buy Hess for $171 a share based on Chevron's closing price the Friday of the previous week. John Hess will join Chevron's board.
""The activist attacks by Elliott, if they had been successful, would have left shareholders with far less than they're getting in the Chevron transaction,"" said Martin Lipton, a founding partner of law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and a longtime Hess adviser.
Elliott Management declined to comment.
On his desk, Lipton keeps a version of the first toy truck made by Hess and last year's model. The dynasty may disappear, but fans will be able to keep collecting the toys. ""The tradition will continue,"" John Hess said in an interview this week. ""In fact, next year is the 60th anniversary. I already know what the model is, but I can't tell you.""

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The smell of mergers and acquisitions is in the air after more than $110 billion of oil megadeals this month -- Chevron's agreement to buy Hess and Exxon Mobil's deal for Pioneer Natural Resources.
Devon Energy is said to be eyeing targets that include Marathon Oil and CrownRock, according to a report from Bloomberg. Gas producer Chesapeake Energy is reportedly considering an acquisition of Southwestern Energy, according to Reuters.
Between the declining pool of quality shale inventory and the limited number of sizable targets in the Permian Basin, energy companies could soon be forced into deal-making action.
The fear-of-missing-out ""component of it is only going to accelerate. See one or two more deals, and there could be a scarcity premium that starts to emerge,"" said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.
Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy and Diamondback Energy are among the largest producers in the Permian, according to data from Enverus, and are large enough that they could be a potential target or an acquirer, according to Pickering. All three have estimated resource lives of roughly 30 years or more, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.
While EOG Resources is one of the top producers there, the company has been more interested in asset acquisitions rather than corporate deals, Pickering added. Smaller Permian producers, those with sub-$10-billion market capitalizations, include Matador Resources and Permian Resources, which agreed to acquire Earthstone Energy in August.
ConocoPhillips could be another acquirer. Given major European oil companies' lagging valuations and the pressure they face to decarbonize, they seem less likely to throw their hats into the ring.
The market was ripe for consolidation. In a white paper published in June, energy asset manager Kimmeridge noted there are ""too many public companies relative to the degree of investor interest"" for U.S. oil and gas producers. In its analysis of filings for the five largest active fund managers (including Fidelity and J.P. Morgan), it found those managers' holdings of the five largest energy companies in the S&P 500 expanded from 40% to 53% of U.S. energy holdings in the second quarter of 2023, compared with the same period five years earlier. At the same time, holdings of smaller energy companies declined.
The valuation gap between the energy giants and the smaller producers has widened. An index that is heavily weighted toward Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other large producers commands a valuation, measured as enterprise value as a multiple of forward-12-month Ebitda, that is 44% higher than an index tracking smaller producers. The premium averaged 14% over the past 17 years and, at the peak of optimism about the shale patch, there was a time when small, fast-growing frackers were valued more highly than larger, less nimble peers.
There is reason to think the wave of deal-making might not be fast and furious. Kimmeridge portfolio manager Mark Viviano argued that, in many cases, entrenched executives and boards at potential target companies don't have an incentive to green light deals. In a previous report, Kimmeridge noted most chief executives of exploration and production companies own very little stock directly and their skills typically aren't transferable outside the industry, making exits undesirable.
The Exxon Mobil-Pioneer deal ""was headline grabbing and I'm hoping it serves as a catalyst, but I'm naturally skeptical,"" Viviano said.
Betting on the next target is tricky, but the trend of consolidation should be bullish for energy-sector investors. While Exxon Mobil signaled the combination with Pioneer will result in more production than if the companies had remained independent, other consolidations over the past 18 months have involved a reduction in rig count, according to Robert Clarke, vice president of upstream research at Wood Mackenzie. As long as future consolidations result in more reductions, it should be supportive for commodity prices and returns.
The growth FOMO that plagued drillers during the shale boom was unhealthy. Consolidation FOMO is one investors can applaud.

The climate lobby's pronouncements that the end of fossil fuels is nigh appear as premature as warnings two decades ago that supply would soon run out. Chevron on Monday announced a $53 billion bid for Hess Corp. because it knows the world will need oil and gas for the foreseeable future no matter how much politicians subsidize green energy.
Chevron's Hess acquisition comes on the heels of Exxon Mobil's $60 billion tie-up with Pioneer National Resources this month. Higher interest rates are prompting consolidation across the U.S. economy, as smaller, less-capitalized companies struggle to borrow. Oil and gas giants are flush with cash owing to the run-up in prices over the past two years.
As he tried to deflect blame for high gasoline prices last year, President Biden demanded that oil and gas companies spend their record profits on increasing production. That's what they're doing. Chevron says the combined company is ""expected to grow production and free cash flow faster and for longer"" than its current five-year guidance.
Hess will increase Chevron's footprint in the Gulf of Mexico and North Dakota's Bakken shale formation. Texas's Permian basin accounts for almost all of the U.S. oil supply growth over the past three years, but its production is expected to start tapering off by the end of this decade. Hess's Bakken assets could then become more valuable.
But Hess's most lucrative real estate may be off the coast of Guyana, where it holds a 30% share in an estimated 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources, which it is developing with Exxon and China's Cnooc. That play currently produces 400,000 barrels a day and is expected to ""deliver production growth into the next decade,"" according to Chevron.
If Chevron believed that demand for hydrocarbons would soon peak and decline -- as the International Energy Agency (IEA) claimed last month -- it instead could have boosted investment in heavily subsidized green-energy ventures such as hydrogen or increased shareholder buybacks.
But oil and gas are yielding a higher return on capital than renewables, even with government's enormous green subsidies. This is why BP and Shell are scaling back wind and solar investment and sinking more capital into fossil fuels. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth says the company will make a double-digit return on capital.
Offshore wind projects around the world are being scrapped because they aren't expected to be profitable amid higher interest rates and material costs. Ford and General Motors are putting their electric-vehicle manufacturing plans in neutral amid slowing consumer demand. Tesla also recently dialed back plans to expand production.
Demand for green energy and EVs could peak sooner than demand for fossil fuels. Population and energy demand are growing mostly in low-income countries. Nigerians aren't going to drive Teslas or power their homes with solar panels. High costs and technological challenges also limit the widespread deployment of green energy and EVs in wealthy countries.
The climate lobby still isn't paying attention. The IEA last month proclaimed that the world is witnessing ""the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era."" Green activists are demanding that companies disclose their ""climate risks."" The real threat to a more prosperous future, as Chevron well knows, is a world with too little oil and gas, not too much."

Companies such as Hess Corp and Cairn Energy as well as countries including Mexico use a hedging strategy to keep selling crude oil at higher prices, even when US and global benchmarks tank, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Hedging is a complicated and risky practice that allows producers to lock in a future price, protecting against falling oil prices. It's paid off for some producers amid a historic rout in the oil market that sent the price of West Texas Intermediate into negative territory Monday. Read more on Business Insider.
------------
Amid oil prices plunging to historic lows, some companies and producers have used hedging to protect against losses.
By using hedging, companies such as Hess Corp and Cairn Energy as well as countries including Mexico are able to keep selling crude oil at higher prices, even when US and global benchmarks tank, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
Hedging is a way to use futures contracts to manage different types of risk. Here's how it's generally used in the oil industry: A company or producer uses futures contracts to essentially fix or lock in a price for a certain volume of oil the group expects to deliver during a set time period.
If oil falls below the agreed-upon price of the contract, the bank or other counterparty in the hedge makes up the difference.
Thus, when the price of oil drops significantly, hedging gives companies and producers some protection against losses. However, it can also include risk — if the price of oil soars, companies and producers may lose money.
Oil prices plummeted to record lows this week, with West Texas Intermediate for May delivery closing at negative $37 per barrel Monday, meaning sellers were paying buyers to take the commodity. Oil has been weighed down heavily as the coronavirus pandemic cratered demand — even historic production cuts from OPEC and allies have done little to boost the price.
Since Monday's plunge, both WTI and international benchmark Brent crude have recovered some losses, but are both down about 73% and 68% this year, respectively.
Lately, Mexico has profited greatly from using such a hedging strategy against falling oil prices, according to The Journal's report.
The country will reap as much as $6.2 billion amid the rout, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday, according to The Journal. Mexico used a trade developed in the 1990s called the Hacienda Hedge, which allows it to sell oil at $49 per barrel. The country has paid as much as $1 billion a year in options negotiated with oil companies and banks, the report said.
North American producers also hedge heavily, according to the report. About one-third of North American oil and production is hedged at $52 per barrel, The Journal reported, citing IHS Markit.
Hess said it has hedged about 80% of oil production, mostly at $55 per barrel for WTI, according to the report.
Going forward, this kind of hedging will become virtually unavailable to companies looking to protect against the oil market crash. Adding hedges will be much more challenging in the remainder of the year due to the downward shift in the curve and the increase in volatility, IHS said, according to the report."

Not all oil companies are equal when it comes to the pain of sharply lower crude prices. Some companies and national producers around the world bought insurance—in the form of hedging strategies—for just such a collapse.
This hedging tool kit allows some companies such as Hess Corp. and Cairn Energy PLC and countries including Mexico to continue selling their crude at considerably higher prices when benchmark U.S. and global oil prices plummet.
Hedging isn't a cure-all. It is complex and expensive, but for some the strategies provide a bit of short-term comfort.
Hedging contracts lock in a price for a certain volume of oil that a company plans to deliver within a specific period, often for as much as three years from the date of the contract. If market prices drop below the agreed-upon or ""strike"" price of such deals, a bank or other counterparty to the hedge agrees to cover the difference.
It can be a risky gambit because hedgers pay banks and oil companies to insulate their prices against market fluctuations—and they can lose money when prices jump.
As the Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
hashed out a historic deal
with the U.S., Russia and other oil-producing nations this month, Mexico nearly scuttled the agreement, resisting OPEC's demands that it join in an emergency production cut.
Unlike other countries in the negotiations, America's neighbor to the south has profited handsomely from oil's pandemic-driven price rout.
The deal saw Riyadh, Moscow and Washington agree to lead a coalition of oil exporters in keeping 13% of global supply off the market. Mexico eventually decided to join in. Yet the pact, the biggest ever of its kind, has failed to spur a significant price rebound as the
coronavirus pandemic
saps oil demand.
On Friday, Brent crude oil was up 2% at $21.77 a barrel and WTI futures are up 2.3% at $16.89 a barrel in a volatile trading week. On Monday, U.S. oil to be delivered in May ended trading at negative $37.63, after closing last Friday at $18.27 a barrel. That effectively meant that sellers had to pay buyers to take barrels off their hands.
On Tuesday, the U.S. oil contract for delivery in June tumbled 43% to $11.57 a barrel, its lowest close in 21 years. Its record low is $10.42 in data going back to 1983. Brent crude, the global benchmark price, has dropped 68%.
Mexico's hedging allows it to sell oil at $49 a barrel. The trade, called the Hacienda Hedge, has been around since the 1990s, helping to insulate government budgets from commodity market fluctuations. In the past, the Mexican government has paid as much as $1 billion a year in options negotiated with banks and oil companies. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday that the hedge would allow the country to reap a $6.2 billion windfall.

""We protected the Ministry of Finance,"" he said. ""We won't lose money due to the oil-price drop.""
In recent years, Iraq's State Organization for Marketing of Oil and the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. in the United Arab Emirates have considered hedging but gave up on the idea after balking at the complexity and costs of the transactions and reviewing projections that suggested prices were headed for a steady rise, according to officials in these countries.
The practice is common among independent North American oil producers. These companies don't enjoy the financial cushion that most major oil companies have and typically rely on high prices to keep pumping.
A third of North American oil exploration and production is hedged at an implied sales price of $52 a barrel, according to IHS Markit.
New York-based Hess Corp. says it has hedged about 80% of its oil production, most of it at $55 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. benchmark. That means the company will make a profit on most of the 200,000 barrels a day it plans to pump this year and will be able to fund its contribution to an 8-billion-barrels Guyana project led by Exxon Mobil Corp.
Thanks to its hedging program, spending cuts and a new loan, ""our company is well positioned for this low-price environment,"" said Hess's Chief Executive John Hess in mid-March. ""Our focus is on preserving cash and protecting our world-class investment opportunity in Guyana.""

Laredo Petroleum Inc., of Tulsa, Okla., and SM Energy Co., of Denver, said they have their production hedged at WTI prices of $59 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively. Oil and gas independent Antero Resources hedges most of its production, and recently said it would cut 13% of spending, while maintaining its output guidance in the U.S. and Canada.
Southwestern Energy Co. of Spring, Texas, another company with a significant hedging strategy, predicted recently that its oil production would increase by 25% this year.
In the North Sea, Cairn Energy says it will be able to maintain its output of up to 23,000 barrels a day after hedging its production at $62 a barrel. Africa-focused Tullow Oil PLC said in January that it had hedged the equivalent of 45,000 barrels a day—more than half its expected output of 75,000 barrels a day this year, at a minimum of $57.28 a barrel.
Now hedging is virtually unavailable to companies that are looking to mitigate losses from the price crash. ""The downward shift in the curve and the increase in volatility will make it much more challenging to add hedges for the remainder of 2020,"" IHS said.

Amid volatile markets and economic contraction, companies have adjusted executive compensation, with salary cuts for top leaders often accompanied by new equity grants.
As companies furloughed or laid off workers and cut other costs, many chief executives have had their base salaries cut for 2020 by anywhere from 50% to 100%. In many cases, they also have received stock or option awards meant to motivate and reward long-term performance -- in some instances, as stocks hit recent lows in March. Companies that made March equity awards included Vornado Realty Trust, Gap Inc. and Hess Corp.
Low share prices at grant times offer the prospect of large gains if markets rebound. Generally, companies say awards are set in advance for business reasons, and that any potential upside from making them when share prices are low is coincidental. As with any equity investment, there are risks, especially in a volatile market amid economic dislocation.
If share prices fall further, stock awards lose value. Option grants made at relatively low share prices can still expire worthless if the share price never rises, or if it rises and then falls again before the options expire or the executive exercises them.
""When the market stumbles, companies have a timely opportunity to award meaningful stock grants to executives because there is built-in potential for appreciation,"" said Stewart Reifler, a lawyer specializing in executive pay.
Many boards review compensation arrangements early in the year. In recent years March has been the second most-common month for S&P 500 companies to make equity awards, after February. This March, 95 companies in the index made awards to 615 executives backed by $2.2 billion in shares, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of securities filings and data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
At many of these companies, the equity awards were similar in size and timing to ones made in years past, though at dramatically lower share prices than last year, due to the market downdraft.
Some other companies awarded executives stock packages larger than at similar times last year or made grants at times they ordinarily haven't. At 48 companies in the S&P 500, the shares underlying executive equity awards had a total value at least 20% higher than awards made in March 2019, according to the Journal analysis.
The total value of an executive's award can be higher even when share prices are depressed if the company grants more stock or options at one time.
Before the pandemic hit, real-estate investor Steven Roth stood to gain about $4.9 million on stock options from Vornado Realty Trust, the commercial real-estate giant he runs. He held those options for a decade and could have exercised them at a profit before March 9, when the company's share price fell below the options' exercise price for the first time in more than a year. By March 11, the options had expired worthless.
The company's share price fell further. Vornado issued Mr. Roth new equity awards on March 30, when the share price closed at $37.60, indicating a potential value of about $4.9 million -- a later grant, and a bigger one, than he has typically received in March in recent years. He received similarly valued grants earlier in the year in prior years.
As the market and Vornado's shares have recovered, the value of the shares underlying Mr. Roth's March 30 award has risen 12% to around $5.5 million as of Friday's close. If Vornado shares return to their February closing high of $67.89, it stands to grow in value by about 80%, to just over $8.8 million.
On Monday, Vornado said in a regulatory filing that Mr. Roth and other Vornado executives would take pay cuts, effective April 1, for the remainder of 2020. The filing said Mr. Roth waived 50% of his base salary, which has been $1 million a year since 2001.
Vornado declined to comment on the equity awards beyond its regulatory filings.
Equity awards have made up the bulk of top executives' pay for years -- nearly two thirds of it since 2015 for the chief executives of S&P 500 companies, Journal analyses of CEO pay have shown.
In general, investors prefer top executives to be paid in stock, reasoning that it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. Awards tend to come in February and March because that is shortly after many companies close the books on their fiscal years, giving boards the time and information they need to determine the size of the awards.
Gap said on March 30 it would furlough employees and that its top executives would take a temporary pay cut. A week earlier, the company had issued options to six executives at around $6 a share, near a recent low and down about 66% from its February high closing price of $18.68 on Feb. 5. The options vest over four years. The March 23 awards were backed by 56% more shares than awards in all of March 2019. Gap shares have risen since the awards to Friday's close of $8.35.
Gap said the March equity awards were tied to the appointment of a new leadership team, including CEO Sonia Syngal, and preceded the biggest impact of the pandemic on the company's operations, including store closures.
""The timing of these awards is based on our company's fiscal calendar and our standard annual rewards process that happens at this time each year,"" Gap said.
Some companies have made an effort to avoid making equity awards at lower stock prices. Mistras Group Inc., which provides asset-protection services to the energy and industrial sectors, said in a regulatory filing on April 6 that it would make equity awards to executives at $9 a share despite the company's stock trading at prices ranging from $3.69 to $5.13 during the relevant period. The company's executive team also agreed to salary cuts ranging from 25% to 45% for its CEO, the filing said. Mistras didn't respond to requests for comment.
John Hess, CEO of Hess Corp., could make up for lost stock options if his company's shares recover from March lows. Early in the year, he stood to gain about $2 million on options that were set to expire on Feb. 3. Hess shares slipped below the exercise price on those options at the end of January and closed below that level on Feb. 3, rendering them worthless.
In March, the company made stock and option grants to its top executives backed by $35.5 million in shares, 23% more than the $28.8 million it awarded to executives in March 2019. Of that, awards backed by about $16 million in shares went to Mr. Hess. If Hess shares return to February prices, the options in Mr. Hess's March 2020 award could yield gains of about $3.5 million. The rest of the award could rise in value by as much as $2.6 million if the company meets various performance goals; if the goals are missed, those shares could prove worthless.
""The equity awards granted in early March were in recognition of our company's outstanding 2019 performance,"" a Hess spokeswoman said.

Some executives' options are already valued more on paper than when they were issued last month.
Industrial-electronics maker Ametek Inc. issued options on nearly 220,000 shares to executives on March 20, including 99,080 to CEO David Zapico, vesting over three years. It was the first time the company had issued options in March since at least 2004, according to regulatory filings.
An Ametek spokesman said the company's board decided in November to shift all equity awards to March. Previously some, including stock option awards, were made in May. ""This timing change has nothing to do with current market dynamics,"" the spokesman said.
The stock has since rebounded, leading to a paper gain of about $1.7 million on Mr. Zapico's options as of Friday's close.

Hess Corp.
Energy stocks were among the only gainers Monday after
weekend attacks
on Saudi oil production facilities. Shares of U.S. energy companies surged, with Hess increasing 11%, Devon Energy adding 12% and Occidental Petroleum gaining 6%. Energy stocks have been crushed by low commodity prices and investors wary of oversaturated commodity markets. Saudi Arabia raced to restore crude production, as the attacks raised concerns about the security of supplies.
General Motors Co.
Early Monday, nearly 46,000 workers at General Motors walked off the job in
the first strike
at the auto maker in more than a decade, causing GM shares to fall 4.2%. The United Auto Workers called on employees to strike after negotiations for a new four-year labor agreement hit a standstill. Union negotiators are pressing the company to keep idled plants open, increase pay and benefits for less-senior workers and provide more job security for temporary workers. Industry analysts have estimated that the strike could dent GM's profit by between $50 million and $100 million daily. Companies that supply parts to GM have been forced to idle plants and lay off workers as the strike continues.
Amazon.com Inc.
Amazon.com's shares took a hit after The Wall Street Journal
reported
the e-commerce giant has adjusted its product-search system to more prominently feature listings that are more profitable for the company. The change, which the company hasn't publicized and which was contested internally for years, is particularly sensitive as the U.S. and the European Union are examining Amazon's dual role as both marketplace operator and seller of its own branded products. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) has argued that Amazon stifles small businesses by unfairly promoting its private-label products and underpricing competitors; Amazon has disputed this claim. Amazon shares fell 1.7% Monday.
Walmart Inc.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said in memos that Walmart likely discriminated against 178 female store workers by paying them less or denying them promotions because of their gender, The Journal
reported Tuesday
. The charges involve workers in more than 30 states. The EEOC documents ask Walmart and the women who filed complaints to come to a just resolution of the matter, which could include a settlement and changes to Walmart's practices, labor lawyers told the Journal. A Walmart spokesman said the company told the agency it is willing to engage in the conciliatory process. Shares rose 0.8% Tuesday.
FedEx Corp.
FedEx
cut its earnings guidance
, citing lower revenue projections for its global Express business, which caused the delivery giant's shares to fall the most in a decade on Wednesday. The slowdown for Express, which ferries packages and around the world by plane, is due in part to uncertainty around global trade. FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith said during the company's earnings call that the company had expected a resolution to the U.S. trade dispute with China as it entered its current fiscal year, but the ""restoration of normalcy"" it hoped for hasn't taken place. Shares plummeted 13% Wednesday.
General Mills Inc.
Investors lost their appetite for General Mills Wednesday, with shares losing 0.9% after the packaged-food maker
extended
its sales slump. The company has struggled to rejuvenate growth amid tougher competition from trendier products and less expensive store brands. The company said it has seen poor demand for brands such as Yoplait yogurt and Nature Valley granola bars. Still, General Mills has made some progress: U.S. cereal sales rose 1% in the quarter, and its yogurt sales in the U.S. were flat, compared with double-digit declines in the past. ""It's about making sure we give consumers what they want,"" Chief Executive Jeff Harmening told the Journal.
AT&T Inc.
Could AT&T say goodbye to DirecTV? The telecom company is exploring parting with the unit, the Journal
r
eported late Wednesday
. AT&T's shrinking satellite business is under a microscope after activist investor Elliott Management Corp. disclosed a $3.2 billion stake and pushed for strategic changes in a letter to AT&T's board. Elliott has told investors that AT&T should unload DirecTV, The Journal has previously reported, and people familiar with the matter told the Journal that AT&T's CEO met with Elliott's portfolio manager on Tuesday to discuss streamlining. Shares gained 1.1% Thursday.

Hess Corp. has emerged as the best-performing U.S. oil company this year. The reasons have little to do with the American fracking boom.
Instead, Hess's popularity with investors is rooted in a small South American nation. The New York-based company holds a 30% stake in an immense offshore oil field being developed by Exxon Mobil Corp. in Guyana that appears poised to become one of the most lucrative megaprojects in years. The company's shares have surged more than 50% in 2019, the biggest increase of any major U.S. oil operator, excluding companies acquired in deals.
It is a peculiar scenario for Hess, one of the largest shale producers in North Dakota: Shareholders are excited about a prized asset it has an interest in, but doesn't control. Hess acquired its stake in Guyana from Royal Dutch Shell PLC in 2014 for an undisclosed price.
Other companies have seen their value surge due to holdings in coveted entities, including Yahoo Inc. which had a stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that for a time accounted for a large portion of its value.
Market enthusiasm for Hess shows how investor attitudes to oil-and-gas companies have evolved. A few years ago, companies of Hess's size faced pressure to sell off assets and focus almost entirely on U.S. drilling opportunities, which were characterized as akin to predictable manufacturing businesses with reliable profit margins.
Although shale operators have helped push U.S. oil output to a record of more than 12 million barrels a day, con sistent shale profits have yet to materialize. From 2014 to 2018, the 43 biggest stand-alone U.S. oil companies lost more than $90 billion, prompting an investor exodus from oil and gas.
Hess lost more than $11 billion in that time.
A group led by Exxon announced a sizable discovery in Guyana in 2015. Since then, the partners, which include Hess and China's Cnooc Ltd., have made 12 additional discoveries, together holding 6 billion barrels of oil and gas.
The initial two projects -- Liza 1 and Liza 2 -- are expected to generate about $22 billion in excess cash for the companies after tax, according to analytics firm GlobalData, thanks in part to generous royalty terms the producers struck with the government. Some critics have said the terms are too generous, and have argued that Guyana should renegotiate them.
One challenge for Hess will be keeping up with the spending that Guyana's abundance will require. The first two of what are likely to be numerous offshore production facilities are expected to cost more than $11 billion over the next 10 years, according to GlobalData. The company has held excess cash in recent years to assure that it will be prepared to pay those costs.
Hess is using cash-generating assets in the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Thailand to fund growth opportunities in Guyana and North Dakota. Hess's production is set to be at the upper end of its guidance at the end of this year and spending below it, a spokeswoman said.
Some investors see buying shares in Hess as a proxy bet on the future of Guyana's oil industry. Support for Hess's Guyana prospects helped the company fend off a serious challenge in late 2017 and 2018 by activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. The two parties avoided a fight after Mr. Hess agreed to buy back $1 billion in shares.
Shareholder excitement over Guyana was a key factor in helping Chief Executive John Hess remain at the company he has run for more than two decades, according to more than a dozen investors The Wall Street Journal spoke with at the time. A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment.
Some other companies that have potentially lucrative opportunities outside of shale have also done well. Noble Energy Inc., which operates giant natural-gas producing assets off the coast of Israel, has seen its shares rise about 18% this year, slightly better than the increase in the S&P 500. An index of U.S. oil and gas producers has fallen by 16% in that time, according to FactSet.
""The utopia is to find an asset that really separates you from the rest of the pack,"" said Norm MacDonald, vice president and portfolio manager at Invesco Ltd., which has assets under management of about $1.2 trillion. Hess and Noble have both done that, he said.

Hess acquired its stake in Guyana from Royal Dutch Shell PLC in 2014 for an undisclosed price. The company initially estimated the resource total at about 500 million barrels of oil. Now it appears to be at least 12 times that amount, making it one of the most significant discoveries in decades.
Other companies have seen their value surge due to holdings in coveted entities, including Yahoo Inc. which had a stake in e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. that for a time accounted for a large portion of its value, and South African media company Naspers Ltd., whose
worth has been wildly boosted
by an early investment in China's Tencent Holdings Ltd.
Market enthusiasm for Hess shows how investor attitudes to oil-and-gas companies have evolved. A few years ago, companies of Hess's size faced pressure to sell off assets and focus almost entirely on U.S. drilling opportunities, which were characterized as akin to predictable manufacturing businesses with reliable profit margins.

prompting an investor exodus from oil and gas
.
Hess lost more than $11 billion in that time. Founded by Leon Hess, the former owner of the New York Jets professional football team, Hess once operated a number of refineries and oil-and-gas properties in numerous countries all over the world. It is also widely known for its sale of toy trucks around Christmas.

John Hess, the son of Leon Hess and the company's chief executive since 1995, has sold off far-flung assets in recent years and developed a simpler strategy that features Guyana. The company also has bought back more than $1 billion in shares.
""They have this very valuable asset, but as a small operator, there is an advantage because they don't have to build up their own organization,"" said Espen Erlingsen, a partner at analytics firm Rystad Energy. ""There is huge upside in the country for this company.""
A group of companies led by Exxon announced a sizable discovery in Guyana in 2015. Since then, the partners, which include Hess and China's Cnooc Ltd., have made 12 additional discoveries, together holding 6 billion barrels of oil and gas.

As additional projects ramp up, Hess's 30% share could grow quite expensive. The company has held excess cash in recent years to assure that it will be prepared to pay those costs.

U.S. refiners are heading into the summer driving season at full speed.
Shares of Marathon Petroleum are up 46% in the year to date, while Valero and Phillips 66 are up 39% and 28%, respectively.
The run-up doesn't seem too excessive considering how profitable it has become to sell fuel. The amount that refiners can expect to make from selling two barrels of gasoline and a barrel of ultralow-sulfur diesel minus the cost of WTI crude oil -- also known as the 3:2:1 crack spread -- has widened to roughly $30 a barrel, up about one-third since the beginning of the year. While crack spreads aren't quite near the records set in 2022, they remain well above historical levels.
Disruptions in the Red Sea are helping boost refined product prices globally. Roger Read, equity analyst at Wells Fargo, estimates that the longer voyage time from diverting ships away from the Red Sea around the Cape of Good Hope has added about $2 a barrel to fuel crack spreads.
U.S. refiners have a distinct advantage because they can source crude oil domestically, from Canada and from South America. Moreover, the longer shipping time for all cargoes has boosted sales of bunker fuel, used as ship fuel, helping refiners that sell the product, Phillips 66 pointed out on an earnings call on Jan. 31.
For U.S. refiners, another tailwind is cheap natural-gas prices. While the U.S. benchmark natural-gas futures have rebounded from rock-bottom levels, they are still very low at about $1.85 per million British thermal units, well below the $3.24 average seen over the past decade. Natural gas is a source of energy for refining operations and of hydrogen that refineries use to lower the sulfur content of diesel fuel.
Meanwhile, domestic fuel inventories look tighter than usual at this time of year. In the week ended March 29, motor gasoline inventories were about 3% below the five-year average for this time of year, while distillate fuel inventories were 7% below, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Ukraine's recent drone strikes on Russian refineries raise the possibility of further tightness for fuel markets. Estimates vary but, as of March 27, HSBC figured the attacks have affected more than 900,000 barrels a day of capacity since January. While Russia does have some excess refining capacity, analysts expect that the country may have to start importing petroleum products.
Sanctions on Russia further complicate the picture. Because Russia relies mostly on China to replace refinery equipment, repairs can take longer, notes Emma Howsham, analyst at Wood Mackenzie. Investors looking for a hedge against geopolitical risks have snapped up gold, now near a record, but they also could load up on domestic refiners.

Oil refiner Phillips 66 named former Cenovus executive Robert W. Pease to its board, succumbing to pressure from activist investor Elliott Investment Management.
Late last year, Elliott, controlled by billionaire hedge-fund manager Paul Singer, took a roughly $1 billion stake in Phillips and advocated for the sale of noncore assets, a focus more on its main refining business and trimming relatively high operating costs.
Elliott said it would also push for the nomination of more directors with extensive refining experience.
On Tuesday, Phillips 66 and Elliott said they would work together to identify a second director to be named over the coming months.
Pease worked as an executive with Shell and as chief executive of Houston refinery Motiva.
""We have worked collaboratively with Phillips 66 on the board's appointment of Bob, who will bring extensive experience in refining and the energy industry more broadly,"" Elliott partner John Pike said in a statement.
In November, Elliott suggested the oil company could follow a similar path to Marathon Petroleum, should Phillips 66 be unable to deliver on its 2025 targets.
Elliott's campaign at Marathon Petroleum in 2019 resulted in the sale of that company's Speedway gas-station chain.
Phillips 66 also operates a chain of gas stations.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Elliott Investment Management's push for change at Phillips 66 borrows straight from its successful playbook at Marathon Petroleum. In other words, it would probably be a mistake for Phillips 66 to ignore it.
The activist investor said on Wednesday that it had taken a roughly $1 billion stake in U.S. refining giant Phillips 66 and pushed the company to sell noncore assets, focus more on its main refining business and fix its track record of relatively high operating costs.
Phillips 66 has the most diverse portfolio among its peers, with large exposure to midstream, marketing and, most notably, a stake in chemicals business CP Chem with Chevron. In theory that means the company could capture more from the full value chain, but the sprawling structure hasn't done much for its performance in recent years. Its refining segment has been less efficiently run than competitors' and its share-price performance has lagged behind them. Phillips 66's refining operating expenses were more than $7 a barrel last year, compared with about $6.46 a barrel for Marathon and $5.11 a barrel for Valero Energy, according to Visible Alpha.
The company has the second-lowest gasoline yield among refiners -- a benefit lately since margins are much higher on diesel these days than gasoline, according to Matthew Blair, equity analyst at TPH & Co. Furthermore, it has high exposure to the heavy Canadian crude oil that is selling at an attractive discount.
Blair notes Phillips 66's diversified portfolio is probably the main reason the company's implied refining-only enterprise value, as measured as a multiple of 2024 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, is lower than its two large peers.
Many of Phillips 66's missteps -- the lack of focus on refining and the failure to deliver on cost cuts -- were under its old chief executive, who left last year. The new boss unveiled some targets along similar lines: The company in late October said it would try to monetize some noncore assets and said it would cut $1.4 billion of costs by year-end 2024. The refiner's shares appreciated 6.4% in the month after that announcement. Investors liked Elliott's involvement even more: Shares are up 9.9% in the few days since its letter was published.
While Phillips 66 was headed in a similar direction, Elliott's participation might spur more drastic changes and more accountability. The activist is suggesting the company could sell $15 billion to $20 billion of assets, much more than the company's own $3 billion-plus target. Elliott is pushing to add two new board members with refining-operations experience.
It is familiar territory for Elliott, whose involvement in Marathon Petroleum four years ago led to a sale of the company's Speedway gas-station chain and a new CEO. Marathon Petroleum delivered about 346% in total shareholder returns since announcing the Speedway sale, vastly outperforming Valero (at 164%) and Phillips 66 (144%). In a research note published last year, BMO Capital said Marathon's operational execution had improved since the Speedway sale.
Phillips 66 has a straightforward, proven path to share-price appreciation. With Elliott at its heels, it might get there faster.

A little activism from Elliott Management nudged Phillips 66 stock to a record close, and if the firm gets its way, there may be more upside ahead. 
Elliott unveiled a roughly $1 billion stake in Phillips 66 earlier this week, arguing that the integrated oil and gas company's decision to de-emphasize refining meant that it missed the refining supercycle of the last two years, leading it to underperform peers such as Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy.
But while Elliott criticized Phillips 66's underperformance and missteps in a letter to the company's board, it appeared to be supportive of plans laid out by Chief Executive Mark Lashier, which include selling some $3 billion of noncore assets and planning to return more capital to shareholders. Still, Elliott believes Phillips 66 could use more prodding and is seeking two seats on the board.
With changes in place, Elliott believes Phillips 66 shares could advance 75%. Wall Street is similarly bullish.
""An activist shareholder, Elliott, can be a positive catalyst for shareholders,"" wrote Wells Fargo Securities analyst Roger Read, adding that Elliott's letter might push Phillips ""to take actions they otherwise might not."" Read has an overweight rating on the shares and a $143 price target.
Representatives from Phillips 66 acknowledged receiving Elliott's letter and recent conversations with the activist hedge fund. ""The Phillips 66 board and management team welcome the perspectives of our shareholders and value their input,"" the company said.

The US oil refiner Phillips 66 has become the latest target of Elliott Management after the activist investor took a $1bn stake and called for new blood on the company's board to remedy ""underperformance"". In a letter to the board yesterday, Paul Singer's aggressive hedge fund said Phillips 66's returns had lagged behind peers Valero and Marathon Petroleum and called for the installation of two ""highly qualified new directors"".
""We find the market's scepticism to be understandable, and we believe the board must take several steps to reassure investors that Phillips 66 is in the best possible position to achieve its value-creation potential,"" wrote Elliott partner John Pike and portfolio manager Mike Tomkins.
Shares in Phillips 66 were up 3.6 per cent in early afternoon trading yesterday. The stock had risen 27 per cent over the past five years to Tuesday, compared with a 64 per cent rise in the S&P 500 oil refining and marketing index over the same period.
The latest campaign from Elliott comes after it prevailed in a stand-off with NRG Energy this month. Following a months-long campaign by the hedge fund, the Texas utility and power producer parted ways with its chief executive and agreed to overhaul its board.
Phillips 66 was formed in 2012 through a spin-off of oil producer ConocoPhillips' downstream assets. It is one of the biggest western refining companies, with 12 plants spread across the US and Europe. It has a big presence in the oil pipeline and storage business and sells fuel to consumers via a network of about 7,200 outlets in the US and another roughly 1,300 in Europe.
The Houston-based company is also active in chemicals through a stake in CPChem, which it owns with Chevron. It is converting its San Francisco refinery into one of the world's biggest renewable fuels plants at a cost of $1.25bn.
Mark Lashier, Phillips 66 CEO, said the company had ""engaged in discussions"" with Elliott and ""welcome[d] their perspectives and the perspectives of other shareholders on our strategy and the actions we are taking to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation"".
Elliott said that the company's performance had declined in recent years ""as it has shifted its focus away from its refining segment"". It cited comments from Lashier in January in which he conceded the company had ""taken our eye off the ball a little bit with respect to refining"".
A cost-cutting programme launched in 2019 had failed to achieve its goals, Elliott said, with a widening gap between its operating costs and that of rival Valero.
Elliott ran a similar campaign against Marathon Petroleum in 2019, which led to the replacement of the CEO and the spin-off of its Speedway retail operation. ""At present, we believe Mr Lashier and the rest of the management team deserve investor support so long as they demonstrate meaningful progress against these targets,"" it wrote.'We find the market's scepticism to be understandable' John Pike and Mike Tomkins

Elliott Investment Management has made a roughly $1 billion investment in Phillips 66 and is pushing for the appointment of two directors as it seeks to bolster the energy company's fortunes.
In a letter to the Houston-based company's board, the activist investor outlined what it said is a path to remedying the Houston-based company's underperformance, improve execution and restore trust with investors. It said it sees about 75% upside to the current share price by unlocking value for shareholders.
Phillips 66's shares rose 3.6%.
Elliott said while Phillips 66's 2025 targets are admirable, investors are skeptical. It said President and Chief Executive Mark Lashier and his management team deserve investor support so long as they company makes progress on its goals, though investor doubts are understandable.
Lashier said the company was engaged in talks with Elliott and welcomed its perspective, and that of other shareholders, on strategy and actions being taken.
""Phillips 66 continues to invest in returns-focused growth opportunities,"" he said, adding the company had a diversified portfolio of integrated assets that positions it to continue driving long-term shareholder value. ""We remain committed to acting in the best interests of our shareholders.""
Elliott said it was sharing its thoughts publicly to encourage an open discussion on the best path for the energy company.
The letter said a key driver of the stock-price underperformance has been Phillips 66's refining operations, where operating expenses per barrel have jumped in recent years. It added that investors also have been disappointed in Phillips 66's cost-cutting programs, and are also skeptical that the company can hit its target for earnings. Elliott said that if it becomes necessary, Phillips 66 could follow a similar path to oil refiner Marathon, which in 2019 agreed to spin off its gas-station chain and consider shaking up its executive leadership to appease activist shareholders, including Elliott.

Elliott Investment Management has taken a $1 billion stake in Phillips 66, the activist investor disclosed in a letter to the refiner's board on Wednesday.
Phillips 66 stock rose 3.6% to $122.20. 4.2% to $122.98 Wednesday morning. The stock has risen 17% this year.
In the letter, Elliott highlighted drivers of the stock's underperformance, and said that after some improvements the stock could reach more than $200, about 75% higher than the current price.
Phillips 66 President and CEO Mark Lashier said in an emailed statement to Barron's that the company has engaged in discussions with Elliott Management ""and we welcome their perspectives and the perspectives of other shareholders on our strategy and the actions we are taking to drive long-term sustainable growth and value creation.""
""Phillips 66 continues to invest in returns-focused growth opportunities, and with a portfolio of diversified, integrated assets, we are well positioned to continue driving long-term shareholder value,"" he continued. ""We remain committed to acting in the best interests of our shareholders.""
After spinning off from ConocoPhillips in 2012, most investors deemed Phillips 66 ""a well-run and high-performing company,"" Elliott said, but over the past three years, the stock has fallen behind peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum, thanks to ""underperformance in Refining, as well as poor execution on its cost-reduction efforts.""
That being said, the activist investor recommends the company appoint two new directors with refining-operating experience to the board.
""We are hopeful the current management team, supported by an enhanced Board, can deliver on its performance targets and achieve significant stock-price outperformance,"" Elliott wrote.
""However, should Phillips 66 fail to show material progress toward its 2025 targets over the next year, we believe that the Company should at that point pursue its best available option by making a strategic pivot and following a path that mirrors Marathon's recent transformation,"" the activist investor continued. Marathon's revamp , pushed by activists including Elliott, involved transitioning to a new CEO, and selling off a business segment.

It said it sees about 75% upside to the current share price by unlocking value for shareholders.
News of the investment buoyed Phillips 66's shares in early trading, sending the stock up as much as 4.4%. The shares are now about 17% higher so far this year, where peer Valero Energy is down a little over 2% and Marathon Petroleum has climbed 28%.
In its letter, Elliott said that while Phillips 66's 2025 targets are admirable, investors are skeptical. It said President and Chief Executive Mark Lashier and his management team deserve investor support so long as they company makes progress on its goals, though investor doubts are understandable and the company's board needs to take steps to reassure investors.

It added that investors also have been disappointed in Phillips 66's cost-cutting programs, and are also skeptical that the company can hit its target for earnings.
Elliott said that if it becomes necessary, Phillips 66 could follow a similar path to oil refiner Marathon, which in 2019 agreed to spin off its gas-station chain and consider shaking up its executive leadership to appease activist shareholders, including Elliott. Elliott said Marathon's shares have outperformed its U.S. refining peers by about threefold after adding a new director, transitioning to a new CEO, improving refining operations under new leadership and selling the Speedway retail business.
Elliott said that if Phillips 66 can't achieve its 2025 goals it could similarly make management changes, close a current $2-to-$3 a barrel gap in refining earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to Valero, and generate $15 billion to $20 billion in cash with the sale of its CPChem stake, European convenience stores and a portion of its non-operated midsteam stakes.
The energy company late last month raised its mid-cycle growth target for adjusted Ebitda to $4 billion by 2025 from $3 billion previously. The company said it has returned $6.7 billion through share buybacks and dividends since July 2022, and it now expected to return $13 billion to $15 billion, where it had previously expected as much as $12 billion. It also said it planned to generate more than $3 billion from non-core assets, which would be deployed to further its strategic priorities, including shareholder returns.
In August, Phillips 66 sold its 25% interest in South Texas Gateway Terminal for $275 million.

Inside Essar's sprawling oil refinery on the banks of the river Mersey, a £200mn machine smashes the molecules in crude oil to help produce millions of litres of diesel, petrol and jet fuel every day for the UK transport industry.
The catalytic cracker is the moneymaking engine of the Stanlow refinery. ""Without this unit we'd make zero profit,"" said Marcos Matijasevich, head of low-carbon transition at refinery owner Essar Oil. ""You would have a really basic refinery.""
But it also contributes heavily to one of the site's biggest problems, accounting for more than 40 per cent of its annual greenhouse gas emissions of about 2.1mn tonnes.
It is a figure Essar's bosses want to bring down. If not, the refinery in Ellesmere Port, which produces 16 per cent of the UK's road transport fuels, is likely to face increasingly big annual bills as the government tightens rules about using clean fuels and how polluters pay for their emissions.
""Europe and the UK is quite a tough place to be, compared to other parts of the world, for lots of reasons,"" said Tony Fountain, managing partner at Essar Energy Transition, a division set up by the refinery's ultimate owner, Indiabased Essar Group.
""One of them is quite aggressive carbon regimes. To be viable in the future, we need a decarbonisation strategy.""
Stanlow's challenges are shared by the UK's five other large refineries, which all face pressure to cut their carbon emissions. Over the longer term, they also face declining demand for their products as petrol and diesel cars are phased out in favour of electric vehicles.
Consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects demand for refined products to hold up in Europe at least until the end of the decade, while the sector globally has enjoyed record margins over the past year. But refinery owners must now work out how to put those profits to work to protect their future.
""We think for the rest of this decade the global [refining] industry's OK,"" said Alan Gelder, vice-president for refining at Wood Mackenzie, which expects oil demand to peak at 108mn barrels a day in 2032, up from almost 100mn b/d in 2022. ""Then the risk of closure starts to emerge in the 2030s.""
Stanlow's efforts are focused on carbon capture and hydrogen: it aims to strip out carbon emissions from critical processes such as catalytic cracking, and it is also planning to produce hydrogen at the plant, extracting it from natural gas.
Under its plans, which are still at an early stage, emissions from both processes would then be piped out to Liverpool Bay and stashed in depleted gasfields.
The resulting ""blue"" hydrogen would be used on site, while Essar ultimately wants to also sell it to factories and other heavy industries in the UK. Last year, it bought a new furnace, used by refineries in the crude oil distillation process, that can be switched to work on hydrogen power.
""The thrust is [ ...] to create a really leading hydrogen business,"" said Fountain. Yet future demand for hydrogen, which has been proposed as a source of low-carbon energy for everything from heavy industry to homes, is highly uncertain. Production costs are high and new infrastructure and equipment would be required.
EET Hydrogen, the Essar company that plans to build the manufacturing plant at Stanlow alongside clean energy specialist Progressive Energy, has provisionally agreed to sell hydrogen to glassmaker Encirc. It has earlier-stage agreements with several other companies, including glassmaker Pilkington. But these are not yet firm sales deals.
Fountain estimates there could be de- mand in the region to support 4.5GW of hydrogen production towards the end of the decade, based on current plans and government targets. This is almost double the current UK production capacity.
He also rejected the idea that blue hydrogen made using natural gas and carbon capture will struggle to compete with green hydrogen made from water in a process powered by cheap renewable electricity.
""I am not sure that's true in the UK,"" he said, although he added that cheap solar power in India could enable ""very economic green hydrogen"". Essar also plans to develop a new import terminal in Liverpool for ""green"" ammonia, made using renewable power, which can then be converted back into hydrogen. Some of this could come from its own projects in India.
Essar has said it wants to invest $2.4bn in the UK, but its hydrogen plans depend on state support. EET Hydrogen is in talks with the government about a contract to support revenues from the planned new hydrogen plant, as part of wider measures to help the nascent industry compete with natural gas.
""At the moment, burning natural gas and buying carbon allowances is still cheaper than buying hydrogen,"" said Matijasevich.
Low-carbon hydrogen production features heavily in other UK refinery decarbonisation plans, although some have run into problems because of costs and lack of infrastructure.
US company Phillips 66 and Danish wind developer ?rsted decided in the summer to ""pause"" their Gigastack project, which would involve making hydrogen from water with power generated by wind farms in the North Sea and using it at Phillips 66's Humber refinery in the east of England, as well as selling it to other industries.
The two companies have withdrawn the project from a government funding round, saying that ""further project maturation together with supply chain development is required"".
Meanwhile, chemicals group Ineos suspended work on a £350mn hydrogen-ready heat and power plant at its Grangemouth refinery and chemicals site in April 2022, citing spiralling costs, and has yet to resume. The plant is one part of its plan to cut the site's roughly 3mn tonnes of annual carbon dioxide emissions.
Ineos's and Essar's plans also rely on supplies of reasonably priced natural gas from which to extract the hydrogen. Andrew Gardner, chair of Ineos Grangemouth, said the Labour opposition's plans to stop new exploration licences in the North Sea if it wins power could increase reliance on imports.
He stressed Ineos is committed to decarbonising, with a target of net zero carbon emissions at Grangemouth by 2045, even after falls in the price of carbon permits cut costs for polluting industries.
""If you did it only on the carbon price then you've missed the point,"" he said. ""It's about the planet. it's about having a licence to carry on.""
While industry experts do not expect all of the UK's refineries to stay the course, Essar is optimistic.
""I think the way that [our decarbonisation] strategy plays is, it will help us be the winner in a very long end game of fuels,"" said Fountain.
""Not every refinery will survive ... there's a bit of 'last man standing'.""
'The way [our carbon removal] strategy plays is, it will help us be the winner in a very long end game of fuels'

| Jump to first hitBOZEMAN, Mont. Bridger Photonics Inc. has contracted with Phillips 66 to use laser-based technology to detect methane emissions at Phillips sites across four states, including Oklahoma.Bridger is a methane leak detection technology provider that uses sensors attached to small aircraft to scan natural gas infrastructure, including pipelines, for methane leaks. Phillips also will use the technology to detect methane leaks in its assets in Colorado, Kansas and Texas.Methane is the main constituent of natural gas, an important energy source supplied and transported by Phillips 66. Methane is also a greenhouse gas, so reduction of methane emissions is an important environmental goal, the company said in a release.The challenge is that methane is an invisible gas. Bridger’s technology, Gas Mapping LiDAR, meets this challenge by using eye-safe laser beams sent down from an airborne sensor to detect, locate, quantify and image gas plumes. The methane plume imagery is then mapped onto satellite imagery and aerial photography to guide ground crews directly to leak sources.After increasing its ownership in DCP Midstream earlier this year, Phillips 66 now operates one of the largest natural gas processing systems in the U.S. Bridger’s scans are part of a voluntary initiative that exceeds what is currently required by regulations for midstream operators.“Phillips 66 is paving the way for the midstream sector and going above and beyond regulatory requirements. We are proud to support them in their emissions reduction goals while supplying safe, and reliable energy,” Bridger President Pete Roos said.Based in Bozeman, Montana, Bridger Photonics provides aerial methane detection, localization and quantification across the entire natural gas value chain."

A nationwide freight slowdown has helped cut U.S. diesel prices by half from last year's record, raising concerns that parts of the world's largest economy have begun to slow.
Wholesale diesel recently fell to $2.65 a gallon in New York Harbor, down from $5.34 last May, after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent commodity markets haywire and turned prices advertised at gas stations into street-level reminders of inflation's 40-year highs. Record diesel costs made it more expensive to operate excavators at construction sites, run machinery on farms, and haul goods from ports, rail yards or factory floors.
Prices began falling months ago, when a warm winter cut demand for heating fuel and a reshuffling of global oil trade alongside Russia's war left a glut of diesel supplies on the market. Now -- with the Federal Reserve trying to cool business activity by raising interest rates -- waning manufacturing output and trade have also dented U.S. appetite for the fuel.
The darkening industrial outlook, which contrasts with low unemployment and a robust service sector, pulled benchmark diesel futures Tuesday to $2.45 a gallon, a 15-month low. Federal record-keepers peg the year-over-year hit to domestic demand at 8.4%.
The declines are weighing on crude oil -- even as China hoovers up more petroleum -- and pushing down margins for refiners such as Valero Energy Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66 Co. The S&P 500 energy sector has slid 3.2% in 2023, after being one of the stock market's few winners last year.
""Diesel demand is being pressured from every side,"" said Eric Lee, a commodities strategist at Citi.
Debbie Desiderato survived as an independent trucker when diesel prices hit records in 2008, so she wasn't fazed when they reached record highs last year. But plunging costs in recent months haven't provided much relief.
Instead, the Virginia-based driver said the rates she can charge for hauling cargo from dog food to pillows have in some cases fallen faster than fuel. Low demand for freight has meant fewer diesel-hungry semitrailers on the road, Ms. Desiderato said, pushing some fellow truckers to sell their vehicles.
""They have had enough,"" the 58-year-old said. ""Right now I'm taking every single load I can get, trying to tread water.""
Signs of slowing industrial activity have been flashing warnings around the world for months. Global trade and manufacturing production dropped 5.4% between September and January, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.
In the U.S., where stores and warehouses remain overstocked after a pandemic-era boom in consumer goods, container imports in the first three months of 2023 slid about 23% from the same period last year, according to logistics technology firm Descartes Systems Group Inc.
For such a steep drop-off to occur any other year, ""the economy would have blown up,"" said Chris Jones, Descartes' executive vice president of industry and services. He added that U.S. container imports have fallen close to 2019 levels.
The diminished activity means fewer trips by fuel-guzzling semitrailers hauling goods across the country, a pullback that has punished trucking companies and pushed the Dow Jones Transportation Average down 11% from its 52-week high in February.
On Tuesday, shares in United Parcel Service Inc. tumbled 10% after the shipping giant reported a drop in first-quarter earnings and forecast its first drop in annual revenue since 2009. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. and J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. last week reported year-over-year quarterly revenue declines and earnings that missed Wall Street's expectations. Shares in both companies have since edged lower.
J.B. Hunt executives pointed to consumers' waning hunger this year for big and bulky products such as appliances, furniture and exercise equipment. They added that the company's customers have been less accurate recently in predicting their freight needs than ever before.
""Simply stated, we're in a freight recession,"" J.B. Hunt President Shelley Simpson told analysts in an earnings call.
Bob Costello, the American Trucking Associations' chief economist, said he has seen trucking companies with fleets in the range of 200 to 300 vehicles failing at a rate of about one a week.
Refining economics look markedly different from last fall, when the cost of the diesel hit a record premium over gasoline and crude oil, turning fuel producers into profit machines that showered shareholders with cash. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. told clients last week that it believes refining margins will continue declining toward historical norms in the coming months.
As diesel prices have fallen in April, shares in Valero have slipped almost 16% this month. Marathon Petroleum dropped 8.7%, and Phillips 66 fell 2%.
Even as price drops provide breathing room for companies that use diesel, truckers such as Ms. Desiderato in Virginia are struggling to stay afloat.
The 21-year veteran of the industry owns her truck outright, unlike many others. Still, lower freight rates have eaten into margins and forced Ms. Desiderato to try avoiding expensive diesel markets such as California or the Northeast.
As jobs hauling wood from a nearby logging company have slowed, however, Ms. Desiderato has felt pressure to maintain customer relationships by hauling cargo on costlier routes.
A recent job carrying textiles to Minnesota took Ms. Desiderato through the Appalachian Mountains -- difficult terrain that hits her truck's already lackluster diesel mileage.
""I've got to take it while I can get it,"" she said.

After a strong 2022, Phillips 66 stock recently slipped, and one director scooped up shares of the diversified-energy firm on the open market.
Phillips 66 stock (ticker: PSX) surged 44% in 2022—a strong year for energy—compared with a 19% drop in the S&P 500 index. But shares began to slip a few days before the company reported weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 31. Phillips 66 stock is now slightly in the red year to date.
Phillips 66 director Gregory Hayes paid $1 million on Feb. 2 for 10,250 shares, at an average price of $97.75 each. According to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hayes now owns 14,300 shares. The chairman and CEO of Raytheon Technologies (RTX), Hayes was named a Phillips 66 director in July 2022 . This is his first purchase of Phillips 66 stock since joining the board.
Raytheon didn't make Hayes available for comment. The transaction looks bullish.
Phillips 66 has stock-ownership guidelines for nonemployee directors, but there was no need for Hayes to buy shares on the open market so soon after joining the board in order to meet them. Since directors have five years to comply, they can meet the requirements by accumulating stock grants over that term.
Wells Fargo analyst Roger D. Read lowered estimates after Phillips 66's fourth-quarter report. Read wrote that investors should ""expect better refining capture, margins, and cash flow for [the] rest of 2023."" He kept an Overweight rating in Phillips 66 stock and a $130 price target.

The Federal Reserve has carefully managed expectations for a quarter-point interest-rate hike this week, the smallest move since it started the most aggressive tightening campaign in a generation last March.
The challenge for Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday is how to guide markets after that.
There are some big reasons to be optimistic that most of the battle with inflation is over. Headline rates of price gains are coming down rapidly. Last week data showed the core personal consumption expenditure deflator , the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, cooled to 4.4% from 4.7%.
Anecdotal evidence from earnings season so far shows most companies preparing for a downturn. Job cuts that started in the technology sector are showing signs of spreading elsewhere. With more than 100 S&P 500 companies reporting this week—including Big Tech names such as Meta Platforms and Alphabet, but also General Motors and McDonalds—more evidence is on the way.
Traders certainly think the Fed will be able to stop soon. That's why the S&P is up 6% so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has gained 11%.
On the other hand, the labor market still looks tight . The unemployment rate is currently matching the lowest in about 50 years at 3.5%. The risk is that a rate that low gives workers enough bargaining power to bid up their wages and embed faster-than-desired inflation in the system.
Harry Truman famously asked to speak to a one-handed economist. Today's Fed is as close as he would ever get, and it's looking a lot harder at the hand that supports interest rates staying higher for longer.

Fed Weighs Labor Market in Efforts to Tame Inflation
The Federal Reserve is voicing concerns that prices that have begun to decline could reaccelerate because labor markets remain tight. The question is whether to put more weight on prices and wages, or how the economy is operating compared with its normal capacity.
* If the Fed on Wednesday raises interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to between 4.5% and 4.75%, that would give officials more time to evaluate the impact of previous rate hikes and for how long to keep raising rates, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* If wages continue growing at rates of 5% to 5.5% that would keep inflation well above the Fed's 2% inflation goal, spurring Fed policy makers to raise their projections for inflation this year. Since December's meeting, temporary hiring and hours worked have declined, offering evidence of softening labor demand.
* The Labor Department on Tuesday will release its fourth-quarter employment-cost index, which measures compensation costs including wages, salaries, and employer costs. It is expected to rise 1.1% from the third quarter and 5.1% for the year, according to FactSet.
* The Fed will likely emphasize that the recent slowing in inflation isn't enough to declare victory and that further hikes are needed, Kelsey Berro, portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told MarketWatch. The Fed won't update the dot plot or its staff economic forecasts until its March meeting.
What's Next: In other Capitol activity to watch, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) will meet with President Joe Biden on Wednesday to discuss raising the nation's debt ceiling. Failing to do so by June could risk a U.S. default. Republicans want to link their approval to spending cuts, Democrats don't.

Tech Super Week: Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Reporting
Tech giants Meta Platforms, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet will report earnings this week. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives expects tech layoffs to accelerate, digital advertising to remain under pressure, guidance for 2023 to be conservative, and cloud and cybersecurity spending growth to remain stable.
* The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is leading the indexes higher, up 11% this year. A continued rally in February could get it to a level where it exits the bear market in tech, which it entered when it fell 20% from its peak. It hit its last high mark of 16,057 points in November 2021.
* Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is expected to report earnings of $2.26 a share on revenue of $31.5 billion on Wednesday. It recently said it was preparing to reinstate former President Donald Trump to both platforms after suspending him in January 2021.
* Apple is expected to report earnings per share of $1.94 on revenue of $121.8 billion in sales on Thursday, according to FactSet. Ives said Apple's results will test the overall demand story for consumers globally and be a snapshot of how China supply-chain issues have improved.
* Amazon.com is expected to report earnings of 17 cents on revenue of $145.6 billion on Thursday. Starting Feb. 28, Amazon will start charging Prime members delivery fees for online grocery orders of less than $150.
What's Next: Ives said Apple is better positioned for economic weakness, with iPhone 14 Pro demand firmer than expected and 20% of users behind on iPhone upgrades. Apple will likely be more prudent with its March quarter outlook, he said. Analysts already have lowered growth expectations.

China's Reopening Brings Opportunity and New Concerns
China's stocks are up 50% since October, as the country abandons growth-stifling policies in place since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials there are embracing efforts to get 1.4 billion consumers spending more, reversing its coronavirus lockdown policies and relaxing regulations on business.
* Chinese people are returning to streets and stores, and hundreds of millions are traveling for the Lunar New Year. Citigroup analysts expect the domestic travel industry to recover to more than 85% of pre-Covid levels by the second half of this year.
* Money managers see gains for some consumer and internet stocks and companies aligned with Beijing's longer-term priorities. Alibaba Group stock, long a favorite with American investors, could rise 25% after a nearly 90% gain since late October. Yum China and JD.com could also benefit.
* Despite U.S. export restrictions on computer chips to China, the nuclear-weapons research outlet China Academy of Engineering Physics has bought sophisticated chips made by Intel and Nvidia at least 12 times since 2020, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* The report said the chips, used in data centers and personal computers, were bought from resellers in China, some as components for computing systems. Versions of Intel's Xeon Gold and Nvidia's GeForce RTX chips purchased by CAEP can be bought off Taobao, an e-commerce marketplace.
What's Next: Air Force Gen. Michael Minihan warned the U.S. could be at war with China by 2025, urging personnel to accelerate their combat preparedness, saying Taiwan's 2024 presidential election could give China's President Xi Jinping an opportunity while the U.S. is distracted by its own election, NBC News reported .

Gasoline Prices Rise Ahead of Another EU Ban on Russia
Oil refineries are the biggest beneficiaries of rising gasoline prices, which are up 41 cents a gallon in the past month to an average national price of $3.51. Summer driving could be pricier than many expect, though it's unlikely to be as bad as last year, when prices hit $5 a gallon.
* Refiners are operating at 85% capacity after taking operations out of production for maintenance over the past few weeks. And demand is rising, with gasoline exports nearly doubling from a year ago, and China's reopening.
* Diesel fuel is climbing ahead of Europe's ban of Russian oil products starting Feb. 5. Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), a Dow Jones company, said it would be difficult for diesel and gas prices to drop in the next two weeks because of market trends.
* Maintenance work on the key Phillips 66 Bayway Refinery in Linden, New Jersey, will begin on Feb. 2, which could hit output. This and the EU embargo both coincide with the expected return of colder-than-normal temperatures across most of the U.S., Kloza said.
* Refiner Valero Energy easily beat expectations for earnings when it reported last week. Its stock is up 23% this year. Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 report earnings on Tuesday.
What's Next: The ban on Russian oil products beginning in February is likely to have a bigger impact than the EU's Dec. 5 ban on Russian seaborne oil and the Group of Seven's price cap on Russian oil, Kloza said.

BP Cuts Oil and Gas Demand Outlook. Renewables to Benefit.
BP lowered its long-term oil and gas demand outlook as it said Russia's war in Ukraine will accelerate the global shift toward renewable energy.
* In its 2023 energy outlook on Monday, the British company cut its oil demand forecast in 2035 by 5%, compared with last year's report, while it sees natural gas demand 6% weaker than it did a year ago. BP raised its 2035 demand outlook for renewables by 5%, and nuclear by 2% in its central scenario based on government decarbonization targets.
* The company said the impact would be concentrated in Asia and the European Union, as both are heavily reliant on oil and natural gas imports.
* Separately, Shell announced an overhaul of its business units Monday, in one of the first major moves by new CEO Wael Sawan. The company said its oil and gas production and liquefied natural gas business will combine into one. Shell's renewables unit will also combine with its oil refining and marketing operations.
* Oil companies such as BP and Shell had a stellar 2022 as higher oil and gas prices led to record quarterly profits . This year is still expected to be a good one but is unlikely to match that as prices cool from highs.
What's Next: The potential acceleration in the global shift toward clean energy should benefit BP and Shell, which are both investing about $1 billion a year in low-carbon energy such as electric-vehicle charging, hydrogen, wind, and solar power.

| Jump to first hitGasoline prices in the United States are creeping higher, reversing a monthslong streak of declines and chipping away at a potent talking point for the Joe Biden administration, which had been emphasizing its success at easing pressure on drivers since the summer.Though the uptick has followed a rise in crude oil prices, analysts pointed to two new factors that are also pushing gasoline higher - a loss of refining capacity in California and Ohio, and rising demand in recent weeks, The New York Times reported.The national average price of regular gasoline stood at $3.891 a gallon on Friday, climbing for more than two weeks, according to data from AAA. That's lower than the record of about $5.02 reached in June but still higher than usual for this time of year.Prices have made a particularly big leap in California. At about $6.39 a gallon, prices are close to the state's June record of $6.44. Gas prices there and in other Western states, including Nevada and Arizona, jumped after several refineries in the region closed for maintenance.The rise, should it last, could increase pressure on the White House to act quickly to bring prices back down. A spike in gas prices, which followed a surge in crude oil and other energy costs after Russian military operation in Ukraine, became both a political liability and a policy headache as consumer prices rose across the board.President Biden, who over the summer responded to the increase in gas prices by chiding energy companies for profiteering on consumers, released oil from strategic reserves and encouraged Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. Gas prices eventually started to decline, as global oil prices tumbled amid rising concern about the slowing global economy and demand eased.As the streak of declines stretched to 98 days, the White House regularly pointed to the drop and the savings it would offer to drivers.The recent jump means White House officials have been pressed to address the issue again. Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Thursday that energy companies needed to lower prices at the pump.If you look at the gap between wholesale and retail prices, it has come down, he said , adding, It hasn't come down enough - right? - but it has come down.Analysts say the refinery shutdowns will be temporary, and the fact that Americans tend to drive less in the winter could keep prices from climbing as sharply as they did in June. But a recent rebound in crude oil prices, which rose nearly 17 percent this week as the world's major oil producers agreed to cut production, means predicting what's next will be difficult.This is not the Biden administration's fault, but they know that if gas prices are back at $4.50 on Election Day, they're in trouble, said Tom Kloza, a founder of Oil Price Information Service, a price reporting agency, referring to the November midterm elections.Aside from the political consequences, a sustained rise in gas prices could affect how businesses and consumers view the economy. In July, falling gas prices were a key part of the better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index, offering a brief glimmer of hope to those looking for signs that inflation has peaked.Among the West Coast refineries that have shut down is one in Washington State run by Phillips 66 and two near San Francisco that are run by Valero and Chevron.Not every shutdown is predictable. A fire at a BP-owned refinery near Toledo, Ohio, shuttered that facility in September. It may not reopen until early 2023, Bloomberg News reported late last month, citing unnamed sources. In Ohio, the average price of gas rose to $3.939 a gallon on Friday from $3.609 a month earlier.Chevron and Phillips 66 said they do not comment on the day-to-day operations of their refineries. BP and Valero didn't immediately respond to questions about the refineries. The refineries do not typically release much detail about closings or when they expect to reopen, analysts said.Prices in California and other states have fallen slightly since Gov. Gavin Newsom said last week that the state could start producing its winter blend of gasoline early, which is cheaper for refiners to produce since it contains fewer of the additives that protect against environmental conditions in the summer. The introduction of the winter blend, paired with the potential for slowed demand in fall and winter driving seasons, could help bring prices back down, said Devin Gladden, a spokesman for AAA.On Friday, Mr. Newsom said on Twitter that he would call a special session of the California Legislature to weigh a windfall profits tax on energy companies that are profiting from high prices, a move that some Democratic lawmakers in Washington have also called for. Britain announced a similar tax on the extraordinary profits of oil companies in May.On Wednesday, the group known as OPEC Plus, which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia, said that it would slash oil production by two million barrels a day, a decision that drew an immediate condemnation from the Biden administration. On Thursday, Biden told reporters that he was disappointed by the decision, and the White House also said it would release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the country's stockpile of crude oil.Though oil prices have climbed sharply this week, the recent increase in gas prices began in September, well before the OPEC Plus decision.The overall impact of the announcement remains a big maybe, Gladden said. It could lead to a short-term rise in prices, but whether or not it is sustained depends on how energy investors react to the cut, he said. Analysts have noted that several OPEC Plus members are already unable to meet production quotas.Crude oil prices account for more than half of the cost of gasoline. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the US benchmark stood at about $93 a barrel on Friday, well below its peak of $130 in March but still up more than 23 percent since the beginning of the year.This really hasn't been about crude, Kloza, the Oil Price Information Service founder, said of the most recent gain, adding, It's been about the inability to refine a lot of that crude for various reasons.Kloza said he did not think an extraordinary spike in prices was ahead, particularly one comparable to what consumers experienced earlier in the year. Still, prices are subject to several variables - many of which, including hurricanes or wildfires that lead to major refinery shutdowns, are unpredictable.If we lost one of these big refineries that can run 500,000 barrels a day of crude or more, it can really haunt the markets,Kloza said. - FNA"

The Phillips 66 refinery in Billings is asking the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to approve its proposal to use sparging to improve groundwater quality in four contaminated areas.
The refinery is located on about 200 acres on the southeast side of the city.
Sparging is a means of “injecting air, oxygen or other additives (such as ozoneperoxide) into the water table to stimulate the breakdown of contamination by microorganisms,” the DEQ explained in its draft environmental assessment.
To use the technique, the DEQ must sign off on a modification to Phillips 66’s permit. The public can comment on the proposal, or request a public meeting, through Sept. 13. The draft environmental assessment explaining the proposal can be found online.

| Jump to first hitOperable atmospheric crude oil distillation capacity, our primary measure of refinery capacity in the United States, totaled 17.9 million barrels per calendar day as of January 1, 2022, down 1% from the beginning of 2021. According to our annual Refinery Capacity Report, 2021 was the second consecutive year of decreasing refinery capacity. We publish two measures of U.S. refinery capacity: barrels per calendar day (b/cd) and barrels per stream day (b/sd). Calendar-day capacity represents the operator's estimate of the input that a distillation unit can process over a 24-hour period under usual operating conditions, taking into account the effects of both planned and unplanned maintenance. Stream-day capacity reflects the maximum input that a distillation facility can process within a 24-hour period when running at full capacity with an optimal crude oil and product slate and with no allowance for downtime. Stream-day capacity is typically about 6% higher than calendar-day capacity. Although U.S. refining capacity decreased in 2021, the number of operable refineries in the United States increased from 129 refineries to 130 refineries. Two new facilities came online in 2021, but a much larger refinery shut down. The new facilities are the Texas International Terminals facility in Galveston, Texas, where a 45,000 b/cd atmospheric distillation unit was built at a refined products terminal, and the Talley Asphalt Products facility in Kern, California, where a 1,700 b/cd distillation unit was reported as part of an asphalt plant. The Phillips 66 refinery in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, (also called the Alliance refinery) stopped refining operations following substantial flooding related to Hurricane Ida in late 2021. This refinery had an operating capacity of 255,600 b/cd. Because the 2022 Refinery Capacity Report reflects conditions as of the beginning of the year, it does not incorporate a few reductions in U.S. refining capacity announced later in 2022. In April 2022, LyondellBasell announced that its 263,800 b/cd refinery in Houston will close by the end of 2023. In May 2022, Phillips 66 announced plans to stop refining petroleum at its 120,200 b/cd Rodeo refinery in California while the facility transitions to refining biofuels.

Biden administration officials struck a more conciliatory tone with oil-company executives in a meeting Thursday to discuss potential responses to record-high gasoline prices .
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm pressed executives from Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Shell PLC, Marathon Petroleum Corp. and other major oil companies and refiners for their solutions on how to boost fuel supplies. But officials didn't criticize those executives for profiteering, as President Biden has done in recent days, participants said, leading to more constructive discussions in a meeting that lasted about an hour.
The group discussed ideas such as waiving Jones Act limitations on domestic shipping, accelerating permits for offshore energy production and the possibility of selling wintertime fuels throughout the summer. Administration officials also indicated they are unlikely to pursue limits on exports, especially oil, saying they understand it would do little to lower prices, according to industry executives and lobbyists in or briefed on the meeting.
But industry officials expect little to come from what amounted to a brainstorming session. Both sides acknowledged there are few, if any, easy short-term solutions available, industry executives added.
Energy Department officials declined to comment on specific ideas exchanged between the two sides. An administration official familiar with the conversations said ""nothing was taken off the table.""
""The secretary expressed that today's meeting will be part of an ongoing dialogue for more effective collaboration,"" the Energy Department said in a statement. ""She directed her team to continue working with these companies, along with any other interested companies, to pursue solutions that alleviate the current supply and price challenges.""
Ms. Granholm acknowledged that refineries are currently running so hard they have little ability to increase production, and told executives the administration didn't want any of them to slow down a transition to biofuels that has further limited capacity in recent months.
""The secretary set a collaborative tone early on by acknowledging the global nature of oil markets and prices, and that some companies, including Shell, have diminished refining capacity because we're busy converting century-old assets to produce biofuels,"" Gretchen Watkins, president of Shell USA Inc., said through a spokesman.
Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon, a driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on U.S. consumers ahead of midterm elections this year. A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy , frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings.
The average national gasoline price slipped Thursday to $4.94 a gallon after sharp drops in oil prices and gasoline futures. The declines were driven by investor concerns that high fuel prices will crimp demand and that rising inflation overall is threatening economic growth.
For months the Biden administration has called on the oil industry to do more to help, spurring frequent pushback and criticism from industry in return. Mr. Biden spent his early days in office moving to fulfill environmental promises to shift the country away from oil, and industry executives say he is now trying to blame them for his political problems , according to lobbyists.
In televised remarks and in a letter to fuel makers, Mr. Biden has recently urged oil companies to expand refining capacity. In the letter Mr. Biden also accused them of profiteering , writing that ""at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto Americans are unacceptable.""
That prompted a pointed response from Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth, who said Mr. Biden's rhetoric wasn't helping to solve the problem and was vilifying the oil industry. On Thursday, Mr. Wirth said the meeting was an important step toward progress.
""Today's meeting was a constructive conversation about addressing both near-term issues and the longer-term stability of energy markets,"" he said in a statement. ""We remain optimistic about our ability to work together to achieve these shared objectives.""
Mr. Biden's options to ease prices in the coming months are limited, according to analysts and economists. U.S. refining capacity has declined to about 17.9 million barrels a day as of the beginning of 2022, down about 5.4% from the start of 2020, according to the Energy Information Administration.
In that time, the number of U.S. operating refineries has fallen from 135 to 130, as companies including Phillips 66 and Shell shut down facilities. Some plan to convert traditional oil refineries to make biofuels, such as Marathon's Martinez, Calif., refinery, Phillips 66's refinery in Rodeo, Calif. LyondellBasell has said it plans to close a Houston refinery in 2023.
John Auers, executive vice president at energy consulting firm Turner, Mason & Co., said oil refineries are unlike other kinds of manufacturers that can quickly restart assembly lines of products when demand returns. The decisions fuel makers have made to shut or convert facilities to make renewable diesel, for example, are irreversible, and it appears unlikely refiners will regain confidence in long-term profit margins to invest in substantial expansions, he said.
""There's really not a lot of solutions and levers or buttons that can be turned or pushed by the refiners,"" Mr. Auers said. ""They are running full out and if they run any harder, they risk making the situation worse by having unplanned outages.""

President Biden urged U.S. oil refiners to expand capacity and accused the companies of profiteering as the public pays record prices at the pump, in the latest effort by the Biden administration to combat soaring gasoline prices .
""There is no question Vladimir Putin is principally responsible for the intense financial pain the American people and their families are bearing,"" Mr. Biden wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to seven major U.S. oil refiners. ""But at a time of war, refinery profit margins well above normal being passed directly onto Americans are unacceptable.""
 The president called on the companies to take immediate action to increase the supply of gasoline , diesel and other refined products. He said his administration was prepared to use its emergency authorities to increase capacity in the near term, if necessary.
Mr. Biden added that he had directed Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to hold an emergency meeting and to engage with the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee that represents the oil industry.
""We see it as a patriotic duty,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Wednesday, ramping up pressure on the companies to boost capacity. Asked what measures the Biden administration might take if the companies don't take sufficient action, she said Mr. Biden would weigh using the Defense Production Act, but declined to offer additional details.
A person familiar with the administration's thinking said the White House doesn't yet have a concrete set of policy proposals for additional executive action to increase refining capacity. The person said the administration is open to receiving ideas on possible executive action from the companies.
Mr. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress are facing pressure to respond to gasoline prices that have recently topped $5 a gallon , a key driver of the rapid inflation that is weighing on American consumers ahead of midterm elections this year. A recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found that the public is widely dissatisfied with the economy, frustrations that are dragging down Mr. Biden's approval ratings .
But Mr. Biden's short-term options for lowering gasoline prices are limited, according to analysts, and the steps he has taken have done little to slow surging prices. Without an easy fix, the president has increasingly blamed oil companies and sought to convince the public that prices at the pump are out of his control, pointing Russia's war in Ukraine as the main driver.
Mr. Biden's letter was sent to Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp., Phillips 66, Chevron Corp., BP and Shell. Mr. Biden requested that the companies provide his administration with an explanation of any reductions in capacity since 2020 as well as ideas for addressing high prices.
Exxon pointed to an expansion project to boost capacity at its Beaumont, Texas, refinery by 250,000 barrels a day, to run light sweet crude pumped from U.S. shale plays, as evidence that it was doing its part to raise domestic output. It said the U.S. government could boost supplies by issuing Jones Act waivers allowing shippers to move supplies around domestically on much bigger vessels, and waive some fuel specifications. Exxon added that the U.S. government could also enable more investment in oil by having more predictable lease sales and streamlining approvals for pipelines.
Shell said it is producing as much as it can from its relatively small U.S. refinery footprint and is exploring other options, including accelerating efforts to lift oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and repurposing an idled refinery in Louisiana to make lower-carbon fuel.
Valero said it is expanding its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.
U.S. refineries closed about 1 million barrels a day of capacity during the pandemic, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Fuel makers have been running full tilt in recent weeks, though last week the amount of operable capacity refineries were using slipped about half a percentage point from the prior week to 93.7%, a drop most pronounced on the West Coast. Refiners in the East Coast were running at 98.3% capacity; in the Gulf Coast, 96.5%, according to data released Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration.
Meanwhile, inventories of crude oil and petroleum products were the lowest since 2008. Gasoline stocks were down 25% from this time last year; diesel stocks were down almost 27%. Exports of gasoline and diesel were both up about 11% from this time a year ago, EIA data showed.
The Biden administration has taken several steps to address high gasoline prices, with limited success. The U.S. has released oil from the country's strategic stockpiles in coordination with other nations and allowed high-ethanol content gasoline to be sold in the summer months.
White House officials said Mr. Biden is considering additional measures, including calling for a temporary suspension of the federal gasoline tax.
The Biden administration has faced criticism from Republicans and some in the oil industry for energy policies that they see as too restrictive. Mr. Biden has said the U.S. should shift away from fossil fuels in the long term in response to climate change. But as prices have risen, he has said the U.S. must expand supply in the shorter term to help consumers.
The Biden administration can do little to quickly alleviate consumers' pain at the pump, or increase refineries' capacity and fuel supplies, analysts say. Refineries are making money now but have operated on far thinner margins in recent years, particularly in the early days of the pandemic when economic lockdowns led to a historic crash in demand.
Before the pandemic, fuel demand was plateauing in developed economies and sales of electric vehicles were rising. Meanwhile, regulators have stepped up fuel-efficiency standards that have led vehicles to use less gasoline.
In recent years, some oil companies have sold off refineries and shut others down amid anemic margins. Last year, Shell sold refinery stakes in Washington state, Alabama, and Texas, but couldn't find a buyer for a facility in Louisiana, and later said it would close it and repurpose it to make lower-carbon fuel. Restarting that refinery as a traditional oil refinery would take several years, Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said.
Meanwhile, Phillips 66 closed a weather-damaged oil refinery in Belle Chasse, La., following Hurricane Ida, and said it would convert it to a terminal facility. The Environmental Protection Agency ordered the company that was then running another refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands to pause operations last year following ""multiple major mishaps"" involving releases of pollutants and oil.
One option for the Biden administration is to expedite the EPA's permitting process for that St. Croix refinery to restart, after the refinery's new owners make improvements to its operations, said John Auers, executive vice president at energy consulting firm Turner, Mason & Co. That could add 200,000 barrels a day of capacity by next year.
Other refinery shutdowns are likely irreversible at this point, Mr. Auers said. He said the prospect for many more refinery expansions is dim, given that policy makers and the investment community are encouraging an energy transition away from fossil fuels.
""Short-term, margins are good, but the long-term view that we're moving away from oil still exists,"" Mr. Auers said.
Some refineries, in pursuit of high margins on fuel, are already running at extremely high rates that, if sustained for too long, could risk breakdowns or worse, said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho.
""He is playing a dangerous game putting pressure on them,"" Mr. Yawger said of Mr. Biden.

 Biden Pushes Fuel Makers to Boost Capacity, Criticizes Profits

A shortage of fuel-making facilities is pushing U.S. gasoline and diesel prices to record levels, just as drivers prepare for the summer driving season.
Gasoline prices topped $4 a gallon in all 50 U.S. states in recent days for the first time ever, even though global crude oil prices have pulled back from highs reached during the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine . U.S. oil prices are hovering around $115 a barrel, down from more than $120 a barrel in March.
Higher crude oil prices are contributing to the cost of gasoline, but the primary culprit behind the pain at the pump is a lack of global refining capacity, say energy executives and analysts.
Demand for gasoline and diesel has all but recovered from pandemic lows in the U.S., despite increasing Covid-19 cases around the country. The problem is that there are now fewer refineries, which convert oil into fuels and other products, than before the pandemic began.
The refining bottlenecks are prompting fears about global shortages of gasoline and diesel. The world hasn't invested enough in maintaining or adding refineries, leading to huge gaps between the price of oil and gasoline, according to Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.
""All mobility fuels have skyrocketed…and the gap between crude prices and these products in some cases is actually 60%,"" he said at a conference in Riyadh in May.
Executives and analysts say the situation could worsen because there are no plans to add significant refining capacity, and fuel demand will grow throughout the summer as drivers hit the road and more economies loosen Covid-19 restrictions.
Here is a look at what's pushing U.S. gasoline prices to record highs.
How much are Americans driving?
Fossil fuel consumption plummeted in 2020 as global lockdowns reduced economic activity and kept drivers off the road, a pullback that extended well into 2021. But despite the persistence of the Covid-19 virus, global demand for oil and gas has essentially recovered to prepandemic levels, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
In the U.S., gasoline demand peaked in 2018 at an annual average of about 9.33 million barrels a day, and fell during the pandemic to about 8 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EIA expects that to increase to around 8.9 million barrels a day, on average, this year and next.
Despite the high gasoline prices, AAA forecasts that 39.2 million people will travel 50 miles or more from home over Memorial Day weekend, up 8.3% from 2021 levels.
Demand for diesel, the primary fuel for the trucking industry and other industrial users, has also soared as economic activity has picked up.
""Few could have predicted the speed with which the U.S. economy recovered from the initial shutdown,"" said Jonathan Wolff, an associate professor of Economics at Miami University of Ohio. ""A growing economy means a growing demand for energy.""
How many refineries are operational?
As fuel demand crashed during the pandemic, refiners around the world permanently closed older and less profitable plants. Around 3 million barrels a day of global refining capacity closed during the pandemic and 1 million barrels a day of that was in the U.S., according to JPMorgan Chase.
The closures were exacerbated by a punishing hurricane season in the Gulf of Mexico, home to the world's largest petrochemical complex, that damaged some refineries there. Some companies are performing maintenance on their refineries right now, keeping even more capacity offline. The utilization rate for U.S. refineries is at about 90%, according to the EIA, at the top of the five-year range.
All of that is pushing profit margins for refining companies to record levels. The margins for producing gasoline in the East Coast are approaching $50 a barrel, up from less than $10 a barrel in the spring of 2020, according to consultant RBN Energy LLC. The margins for producing diesel in the East Coast spiked to more than $100 a barrel in late April but are now around $60 a barrel, RBN said.
""Refinery capacity rationalizations that have taken place in the last couple of years continue to contribute to the supply tightness,"" Valero CEO Joseph Gorder said on a call with analysts in April. Valero, the second largest U.S. refiner, reported its best margins since 2015 in the first quarter.
Why are refineries closing if they are so profitable right now?
Increased demand typically leads to more investment in supply, but refiners aren't rushing to add capacity. That's because before the pandemic, fuel demand was plateauing in the U.S. and other parts of the world as many countries began to transition to cleaner sources of energy.
When the pandemic took hold, companies took the opportunity to shut down older plants in the world's richest countries, including the U.S., Australia and Europe. Despite a resurgence in fuel demand, refining companies' views on demand's long-term trajectory haven't changed. A refinery can take 20 years to recoup the initial investment, making the current business case for a new plant dim.
When Hurricane Ida damaged Phillips 66's Alliance refinery in Louisiana, it permanently shut the plant instead of investing more than $1 billion in repairs. By the end of 2023, as much as an additional 1.69 million barrels of U.S. refining capacity is expected to close, according to consulting firm Turner, Mason & Co.
Some companies are converting refineries into plants that can produce biofuels and other greener products. Phillips 66 said in May that it will spend $850 million to convert its San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, Calif., into a renewable fuels facility.
How is Russia's invasion of Ukraine contributing to the situation?
The war in Ukraine is exacerbating a fuel market that has little to no cushion. Western sanctions have forced Russian refiners to shut down 800,000 barrels a day of capacity and potentially as much as 1.4 million barrels a day in May as product flows to Europe have stopped, according to JPMorgan Chase.
That has left European consumers to look to the U.S., Asia and the Middle East for replacements, further drawing on already tight supplies. Refiners on the East Coast have ramped up fuel exports to Europe, depleting domestic stockpiles, especially of diesel.
Earlier this month, U.S. diesel fuel inventories fell to their lowest levels in 17 years, according to JPMorgan Chase, drawing at a time of year when stocks are normally flat or building. On the East Coast, storage levels of diesel fell in May to their lowest level in the 40-year history of EIA measurements, the bank said.
Overall, U.S. inventories of gasoline are 18.8 million barrels, or 8%, below the average for this time of year, according to the EIA.
Is relief at the pump coming anytime soon?
Many energy analysts and executives believe high fuel prices will persist for the rest of the year and may even get worse.
The end of spring maintenance season for fuel makers could add an additional 2.5 million barrels of capacity as plants come back online, according to JPMorgan Chase, potentially preventing further draws on stockpiles. But Covid-19 lockdowns in China are keeping a lid on global fuel demand, and if those lift, there will be even more competition for tight fuel supplies.
Meanwhile, more Russian refineries may close as the war continues, and the European Union's proposed ban on Russian oil would likely cause gasoline prices to increase further, say analysts. This year's Atlantic hurricane season is forecast to be more active than usual, and if a significant amount of refining capacity were forced offline, similar to past seasons, the U.S. could actually run out of certain fuels, JPMorgan Chase said.
""Should China emerge from its Covid constraints, demand could come back ferociously and into a market that is already tight,"" said Peter McNally, an analyst at Third Bridge. ""U.S. refinery utilization is approaching its limits and any disruption would make the U.S. more dependent on fuel imports, potentially leading to higher prices.""

Apple paid out about $14.5 billion of dividends in its most recent fiscal year, ended last September. That's a lot in absolute dollars, but the stock's recent yield was a paltry 0.6%.
Even beyond yield, other metrics suggest that Apple (ticker: AAPL) could be doing more with its payout. Based on the last fiscal year's earnings of $5.61 a share, Apple's dividend payout ratio is about 16%—not that high, though technology companies tend to pay out a lower ratio of earnings than the overall market's ratio of about 30%. Apple also lags behind the broader market and even its own sector in yield: S&P 500 technology companies recently yielded about 1%, compared with 1.6% for the broader market, according to FactSet.
When it comes to capital returns, Apple emphasizes share repurchases, which totaled about $86 billion for its common stock last year, over dividends. Stock buybacks are seen as way to boost earnings growth, partly because the profits get spread across fewer shares. ""The Street wants to see more of a focus on [growth] than dividends for Apple,"" says Dan Ives, a technology sector analyst at Wedbush.
But imagine if Apple did sport a higher yield—something that could make sense, given its low payout ratio and its relatively high price/earnings ratio of 22.3, above its five-year average near 20. Factoring in a 35% payout ratio on last year's earnings of $5.61, the annual dividend would more than double to about $2 a share from 92 cents. That would boost the yield to a more respectable 1.3%.
Since we're spending Apple's cash here, let's see where the funds for a higher payout would come from and what it might do to stock buybacks. A common definition of free cash flow—which many companies rely on for dividend payments—is operating cash flow minus capital expenditure. For Apple, operating cash flow totaled $104 billion in its 2021 fiscal year, and acquiring property, plants, and equipment came to about $11.1 billion.
So, by that calculation, the tech giant's free cash flow totaled about $93 billion. If it were to rely only on its free cash to pay out more in dividends, Apple would need to dial back its share repurchases, something that seems unlikely right now.
During its most recent earnings call, in late April, Apple said it would raise its quarterly disbursement to 23 cents a share, up 4.5% from 22 cents, and said that it's planning for annual dividend increases moving forward. Apple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said the company didn't have anything to add beyond those moves.
The upshot: Apple right now is unyielding in its commitment to dividend increases, but not necessarily to its dividend's yield.
Bank on This 7%-Plus Yield
When a dividend yield gets to 7%, it can be a sign that a company is in distress and that a dividend cut is approaching. That doesn't appear to be the case for New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), however.
Based in Hicksville, N.Y., the bank underwrites a lot of loans for multifamily, rent-stabilized, and nonluxury buildings in New York City, though its loan portfolio includes some commercial real estate, as well. As of May 10, the stock yielded a hefty 7.6% and had a one-year return of minus 19%, compared with about minus 12% for the Invesco KBW Regional Banking exchange-traded fund.
One of the overhangs on the stock has been a lengthy regulatory approval process for the bank's impending acquisition of Michigan-based Flagstar Bancorp (FBC). During New York Community's first-quarter earnings call in late April, CEO Thomas Cangemi said in part that he was confident in ""our priorities to continue maintaining our dividend position."" Cangemi added that he expects the Flagstar acquisition to boost earnings.
Indeed, analysts don't see the deal's holdup as a reason to question the dividend's viability. ""Management is committed to the dividend, and I think the dividend is safe,"" says Peter Winter, an analyst at Wedbush who has a Neutral rating on the stock.
 Jenny Harrington , CEO and portfolio manager of Gilman Hill Asset Management, agrees. She points out that the company's dividend—currently 68 cents a share on an annual basis—is well covered by its earnings.
The bank reported earnings last year of $1.20 a share, which is expected to rise to $1.32 this year, according to analysts polled by FactSet. Based on last year's earnings, the company sports a dividend payout ratio of about 57%, a reasonable level.
In an email to Barron's, a company spokesman said, ""We have ample capital, strong earnings, and, more importantly, little to no losses in our loan portfolio, given our conservative underwriting practices that all help support our dividend.""
Powering Up Payouts
Energy company dividends continue to increase after dipping early in the pandemic, powered lately by rising commodity prices.
After dropping by 13% in the second quarter of 2020 to about $10 billion, S&P 500 energy dividends have increased every quarter since then through the end of 2021 to $12.2 billion, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. What's more, the S&P 500's energy sector had returned about 38% this year as of Thursday, dividends included—by far the best performer among the index's 11 sectors.
Two of the latest hikers:
• Refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) this past week declared a quarterly dividend of 97 cents a share, up about 5% from 92 cents. It's the second increase in less than a year. Phillips 66 boosted its quarterly payout by two cents late last year.
• Earlier this month, exploration-and-production company EOG Resources (EOG) declared a regular quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share, unchanged from the previous quarter. However, it also declared a special dividend of $1.80 a share, compared with the special of $1 a share it paid out in March. EOG's chief financial officer, Timothy Driggers, said the company intends ""to return cash through special dividends or stock buybacks"" every quarter going forward, subject to commodity prices, the amount of free cash flow available, and the board's discretion.

2652863997,"Apr 21, 2022","Oil Trade Group Drafts Carbon-Tax Proposal That Could Raise Prices at the Pump; Some API members want to delay proposal until after midterm elections, fearing it could alienate Republican lawmakers",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/oil-trade-group-drafts-carbon-tax-proposal-that/docview/2652863997/se-2?accountid=7064,PSX,"Turn on search term navigationTurn on search term navigation

WASHINGTON—The nation's biggest oil industry trade group has drafted a proposal urging Congress to adopt a carbon tax , which would put a surcharge on gasoline and other fossil fuels to discourage greenhouse-gas emissions.
The draft proposal was approved by the American Petroleum Institute's climate committee last month, according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The measure must still be approved by the group's executive committee.
A carbon tax would raise gasoline prices and other energy costs for consumers. Some API members want to delay action on the proposal amid near- record prices at the pump , contending it could alienate not only voters but Republican lawmakers friendly to the oil industry ahead of midterm elections , according to people involved in the discussions or who were briefed on them.
""The worst case is not get the policy, and lose the friends,"" one of the people said. ""Today, that's probably the most likely possibility.""
The API proposal calls for assessing gasoline wholesalers, power plants and others a tax starting at $35 to $50 a ton for carbon dioxide generated by the fossil fuel they sell or use, with annual adjustments for inflation and other factors, according to the document reviewed by the Journal,
Some Democrats who once supported a carbon tax now oppose it, on grounds that the costs are passed on to consumers, including many who can't afford it. The API proposal suggests rebating some of the revenue collected by the carbon tax to households and to invest the rest of the money in new technology.
The draft proposal says a carbon tax is ""the most impactful and transparent way to achieve meaningful progress on the dual goals of reducing greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions while simultaneously ensuring continued economic growth.""
The measure is a follow-up to last year's decision by API to push Congress for legislation to price carbon emissions across the economy, in what was a policy turnabout a decade after the organization helped to kill a similar plan .
API spokeswoman Megan Bloomgren said the proposal is under a routine review by the organization, which she said was ""focused on the most transparent and impactful ways to reduce emissions at the lowest cost for American families.""
Several climate committee members pushed to send the measure to the API's executive committee for final approval, the people said. Instead the measure was referred to API's lobbying committee, which has pushed to delay the completion and rollout of the policy until later this year, they said.
Some API members, including representatives of European-based producers Shell PLC and Equinor ASA, want API to take action quickly on the carbon-tax proposal to show that climate change is a top priority, according to the people.
""Shell remains committed to taking actions and convening important conversations, including at API, that could ultimately lead to putting a price on carbon,"" a Shell spokesman said.
An Equinor spokesperson declined to comment on the API proposal but said the company ""is a long-standing advocate of carbon pricing, which we see as being a key enabler of the energy transition.""
Companies including Hess Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66, along with API's lobbying team, argued a delay was necessary to help the industry avoid political blowback because a carbon tax has become unpopular among both conservatives and liberals, the people said.
A Hess spokeswoman said the company has supported pricing carbon emissions generally in its securities filings. A Phillips 66 spokesman said the company supported the API carbon pricing framework but didn't address the carbon tax proposal approved last month.
""An economywide carbon price appears to be one of the more efficient and effective ways to reduce carbon emissions,"" a Marathon spokesman said. ""However, as with any policy initiative, details will be very important.""
Some within API are concerned that coming out in favor of the tax now could anger Congressional Republicans, who have long been staunch allies of the oil industry. Some of these lawmakers were displeased last year when API publicly pivoted on climate change, calling on Congress to address it with policies such as a price on carbon.
Rep. Garret Graves (R., La.), Republican leader of the House Select Climate Committee, said Thursday the idea of a carbon tax ""is just idiotic right now"" given Russia's invasion of Ukraine and high energy prices.
""It is mind-boggling that anyone could look at the current state of affairs and conclude that putting an additional tax on American gasoline and energy is a solution for anything,"" he said.
API's Ms. Bloomgren said any carbon pricing system should address what she called ""hidden taxes and overlapping regulations"" to mitigate the impact of a carbon tax on U.S. consumers.
Earlier this week, the Business Roundtable, an association of top U.S. executives, announced energy policy recommendations that included ""a price on carbon where it is environmentally and economically effective."" The group didn't specifically call for a carbon tax, however.
The action drew a sharp rebuke from three Republican lawmakers.
""If the Business Roundtable really wanted to promote a forward-thinking energy strategy for America, they would stand up for their members and American workers by advocating for more American energy production to lower costs and carbon emissions,"" said a statement from House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.), Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R., Okla.) and Jeff Duncan (R., S.C.).
Those pushing for delaying action on the carbon tax want to wait until after the midterm elections, when Republicans could retake control of the House and Senate, the people said. Their view is that Republicans would still likely oppose the carbon tax after the election, but would be less likely to get angry at the oil industry if it doesn't push the issue during an election year, the people said.
Others within API are skeptical, seeing a delay as a potentially deadly blow to the effort. This year may be the only chance to pass such policy with Democrats now crafting a climate and energy bill , which Republicans said they would oppose.
The rift over the carbon-tax proposal is the latest in a series of disputes within API over the industry's approach to climate change.
TotalEnergies SE of France canceled its API membership last year citing disagreements on climate policy, while Shell and BP PLC—both based in London—have their membership under review.
That puts them at odds with U.S. independents and refiners whose businesses are more closely tied to selling crude and gasoline. They have been slower to support climate policy that may make their products more expensive.
In recent years, much of the industry has come out in favor of carbon pricing as a way to show they are willing to address climate change. That shift took a credibility hit last year when an Exxon Mobil Corp. lobbyist, tricked into being recorded by Greenpeace, said his company's support for a carbon tax was merely an ""easy talking point"" because it is a policy unlikely to ever be implemented. Exxon later disavowed those comments .

Is instituting a carbon tax a viable option to fight climate change? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The carbon tax would ultimately be paid by consumers. The proposal recommends placing stickers on gasoline pumps to show motorists the carbon tax added to the price of a gallon of gasoline, and says transparency on the cost of the policy would help consumers understand how to limit their own emissions.
In a nod to likely objections to a tax increase that would be felt by consumers, the proposal states ""the categorical implementation of a federal carbon tax regime should not be at the expense of economic expansion.""
Other key recommendations in the proposal include rebates for exporters and tariffs on imports that come from countries without a carbon tax, with the proposal calling it necessary for U.S. competitiveness. And it says the U.S. government should put a moratorium for several years on any new regulations to limit carbon emissions while it collects data on whether the tax is effective on its own at reducing emissions.

Several analysts and strategists expect energy stocks to outperform the broader market in 2022, as they did in 2021. Energy tends to do well in inflationary environments, and oil and gas stocks in particular have been laggards for so long that they may be due for a prolonged comeback. Investors are already making big bets on oil prices to rise .
Mark Haefele, chief investment officer for global wealth management at UBS, noted on Wednesday that the stocks in the industry have lagged oil prices, so they still have room to rise. ""The MSCI World Energy Index's 2021 rise of 35% lagged the 50% oil price rally, and we expect a catch-up this year,"" he wrote.
Analysts have been sending out notes with their top oil and gas picks for 2022. Several of them highlight stocks with strong free cash flow. Others see a rebound coming for oil and gas service stocks, which have struggled in recent years as producers cut back on spending.
Among the stocks receiving the most positive attention is midsize Denver producer Ovintiv (OVV), whose strong cash flow prospects could give it an edge. Ovintiv stock has doubled in the past year, trading at a recent $39, but some on Wall Street think its rally is just getting started.
Truist analyst Neal Dingmann says investors should consider a ""barbell approach"" with two baskets of stocks—buying large high-quality names that offer strong dividends and buybacks, while also buying small-cap stocks with attractive valuations. His favorite big names include Coterra Energy (CTRA), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Marathon Oil (MRO). Smaller stocks he likes include Earthstone Energy (ESTE), Northern Oil & Gas (NOG), Ovintiv, and Ranger Oil (ROCC). And he picks two ""story"" stocks: APA(APA) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY).
Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate also likes Occidental, Apache, and Ovintiv, along with Hess (HES), because investors will begin to take notice of improvements at those companies and their valuations could improve. For Occidental, that includes possible shareholder returns after years of debt issues. He also likes Exxon Mobil (XOM), given ""renewed confidence in its dividend outlook.""
In a separate note, Bank of America analyst Chase Mulvehill wrote that oilfield services stocks are ""returning from the abyss"" as U.S. producers in particular spend more on drilling. His top stocks for 2022 include Halliburton (HAL), Patterson-UTI Energy (PTEN), Nextier Oilfield Solutions (NEX), and Cactus (WHD).
At Citigroup, analyst Scott Gruber's top North American oil and gas equipment and services stock is Houston company NOV (NOV).
Ovintiv also made the list of top picks at UBS, where analyst Lloyd Byrne praised the company's improving shareholder payouts. His other picks include Chesapeake Energy (CHK), Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), ConocoPhillips (COP), Cenovus Energy (CVE), Suncor Energy (SU), Chevron (CVX), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Baker Hughes (BKR).
Tudor Pickering Holt analysts prefer Cenovus and Devon Energy (DVN), ""given massive free cash flow and accelerating capital returns"" while Targa Resources (TRGP) ""takes our top slot in the midstream group as return of capital shifts from a debt to equity focus."" They recommend Phillips 66 in refining and Baker Hughes in oilfield services ""given peer leading capital returns.""
Morgan Stanley's Devin McDermott, like some other analysts, is recommending investors focus on stocks with more ""liquid exposure"" over gas.

------------
Plug Power surged as much as 13% on Wednesday after the hydrogen fuel-cell developer said it inked partnerships with Airbus and Phillips 66.
The Latham, NY-based company partnered with Airbus to conduct a feasibility study of bringing hydrogen to future aircraft and airports. Airbus is working towards a goal of bringing zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035, and it thinks hydrogen could play a role in that goal.
Airbus will work closely with Plug Power to develop a joint study and roadmap that could deliver hydrogen to aircraft and the airport ecosystem in the future. Plug Power will build deployment scenarios for green hydrogen infrastructure at airports, while Airbus will provide insight on hydrogen aircraft characteristics.
""This partnership with Plug Power will enable us to leverage their expertise to decarbonize airports while preparing them for the arrival of hydrogen aircraft by 2035,"" Airbus Vice-President Glenn Llewellyn said.
Separately, Plug Power signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on the development of hydrogen-based business opportunities with Phillips 66, a diversified oil refiner that also operates retail gas stations.
The companies will explore how to deploy Plug Power's technology within Phillips 66's operations, including scaling hydrogen into the industrial sector, advancing hydrogen fueling opportunities, and developing hydrogen-related infrastructure.
Also aiding to a boost in Plug Power's stock on Wednesday is an upgrade from Morgan Stanley. The bank raised its price target on Plug Power to $40 from $35, representing potential upside of 34%, and upgraded it to ""Overweight"" from ""Equal-weight."""

The equipment was donated to the Oklahoma Historical Society.The rig, which still bears the Phillips 66 logo, will remain in place, preserved by the Oklahoma Historical Society as a monument and tourist draw.The tanks were removed as part of a voluntary program for cleaning up old well sites. The average cost to clean up a historic site runs about $7,000, making cleanup cost-prohibitive for landowners.

Officials have said they are investigating hundreds of potential spill sites after the storm.* See more stories on Insider's business page.
More than 100 birds have been found covered in oil after Hurricane Ida tore through Louisiana and caused a spill, wildlife officials said.
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) said the birds were oiled from a spill that occurred at the Phillips 66 Alliance Refinery in Belle Chasse, Louisiana.
Officials said they have located birds ""within heavy pockets of crude oil"" at the refinery as well as nearby retention ponds and flooded fields. They expect to find even more birds affected by the spill.
""Some of the oiled birds have been captured and transported to a designated rehabilitation location,"" LDWF said in a statement. ""It may take weeks before the effort to save the birds and other animals is completed.""
Some of the species found with oil were black-bellied whistling ducks, blue-winged teal, and various egret species.
In addition to birds, alligators, river otters, and nutria - large, semi-aquatic rodents - have been found with some oiling.
The US Coast Guard said earlier this week it is investigating 350 reported incidents pertaining to oil spills in the wake of Hurricane Ida.
Coast Guard crews have been visiting sites to ""conduct hazard assessments in order to identify and prioritize threats to the environment and navigable waterways.""
The Environmental Protection Agency said it received 43 reports of ""significant inland oil spills and chemical releases in its jurisdiction after Ida,"" according to The Associated Press.
AP first reported the oil spill at Alliance Refinery alongside aerial photos on September 1.
Phillips 66 did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on the spill.
AP said the company tried to downplay the spill in the days after it occurred, but after inquiries from AP said they ""discovered a sheen of unknown origin in some flooded areas"" at the refinery. The company told the outlet Thursday that the ""site was isolated and brought under control last week.""

The smell of sulfur and clouds of thick smoke covers the Shell factory in Louisiana as it spews chemicals after being hit by Hurricane Ida.
The Hurricane has caused a gasoline spill endangering the health of both local residents and the local environment. The degree of the pollution is unknown, with emergency and environmental services still getting back up-and-running after the hurricane's devastation, The Guardian reported.
As a result of Hurricane Ida's devastation across the country, Shell says that 80% of its production remains offline, according to Oil and Gas Journal.
Shell factories aren't the only factory impacted. Energy company Phillips 66 reported two damaged pipelines in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, Bloomberg reports, leading to a propane and isobutane leak, both flammable gases that are highly dangerous to humans.
Bernardo Fallas, a spokesman for Phillips 66, said the pipelines had been shut down before the storm made landfall, and any chemicals that remained were being flared. The company would assess the damage and start repairs once its workers safely reached the site, The New York Times reported.

Energy companies were assessing the health of refineries, pipelines, petrochemical plants and offshore oil platforms along the central Gulf of Mexico on Monday, the day after Ida struck Louisiana as a powerful Category 4 hurricane.
Widespread flooding and power outages affecting more than one million customers across the state could leave gasoline makers along the banks of the Mississippi River scrambling to restart operations after they assess damages this week, analysts said.
Companies including Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp., Phillips 66 and Royal Dutch Shell PLC shut roughly 8% of the nation's refining capacity ahead of the storm, while Colonial Pipeline Co., operator of the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, closed two lines that carry fuel from Houston to Greensboro, N.C. Exxon Mobil Corp. had shut some units at its chemicals and refining complex in Baton Rouge, but said there was no significant storm damage.
""There's no clarity,"" around power supplies in the region as of yet, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for Oil Price Information Service, or OPIS. ""If they say the southeastern parishes that house a lot of big refineries aren't going to be back on the grid for weeks, it's a much more serious event.""
Companies in coming days will work carefully to determine whether flooding, wind or other impacts of Ida caused any damage to the integrity of their facilities or posed any environmental threats.
Major storms have caused severe problems for industrial plants in the past, such as in 2017, when flooding from Hurricane Harvey led to a failure of a main power source for a plant owned by chemical maker Arkema SA near Houston. The plant caught fire and exploded after the storm.
In 2005, following Hurricane Katrina, hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil spilled from a storage tank at a refinery, then owned by Murphy Oil Corp., with some leaking into neighborhoods near New Orleans.
Marathon is developing a timeline to restart its 565,000 barrel-a-day refinery at Garyville, La., a spokesman said. Exxon said its Baton Rouge plant will start returning operations to normal once it confirms it has access to feedstocks and third-party utilities ""to stabilize our systems.""
Phillips 66 said its 255,000 barrel-a-day refinery in Belle Chasse, La., was still closed Monday evening, and that the facility had taken on water. It planned to survey Ida's impact ""when it is deemed safe to do so.""
Gasoline futures rose as much as 4.3% overnight but pared gains and were up about 1.6% Monday. Average U.S. gasoline prices were expected to register little impact from the storm, likely only rising 5 to 10 cents a gallon, analysts said, well below price surges that followed Katrina and Harvey.
The average U.S. price for a gallon of regular rose less than 1 cent to about $3.15 Monday, with prices roughly flat in Louisiana, according to AAA.
Still, prolonged refinery shutdowns caused by flooding and other delays in the fuel supply chain could push pump prices higher, by as much as 15 to 25 cents a gallon nationally in the worst-case scenario, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at fuel and price tracker GasBuddy.
""Refineries have adapted to wind speed,"" Mr. De Haan said. ""What they can't do is build and plan for 12 to 24 inches of rain.""
Data collected by GasBuddy showed about 10% of gasoline stations in the Baton Rouge area were out of fuel over the weekend, as were 7.5% near New Orleans. Those figures are expected to worsen sharply as Ida passes, and it could take a week or two for regional supplies to recover in the state's hardest-hit areas, Mr. De Haan said.
All told, roughly 4.4 million barrels of refining capacity was projected to have been in Ida's path, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, roughly a quarter of the U.S. total. The firm also estimated petrochemical facilities with a combined 6.5 million tons a year of capacity for ethylene, a key ingredient for plastics, were vulnerable to the storm.
Dow Inc., which owns petrochemical plants in Louisiana, said it shut manufacturing operations over the weekend. Other companies with chemical operations that were in Ida's path included Westlake Chemical Corp. and NOVA Chemicals Corp., according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Adding to the uncertainty is the recovery time for major power failures across the state. Entergy Corp., a major Louisiana power supplier, said all eight transmission lines feeding power into New Orleans were down Sunday, causing generation to come offline and leaving the city in the dark. Power was out for more than one million customers in Louisiana on Monday, according to data from poweroutage.us.
Entergy said it had crews ready to mobilize from at least 22 states for restoration work, but warned the outages could last weeks in the areas hardest hit by the storm. It will take days to determine Ida's damage to its power grid in New Orleans, ""and far longer to restore electrical transmission to the region,"" the company said on social media Monday.
Entergy shut down a nuclear plant 25 miles west of New Orleans on the Mississippi River ahead of the storm. It lost off-site power on Sunday and was relying on emergency diesel generators, according to a regulatory notice.
Colonial said it expected to bring its two key lines back online Monday evening, following damage assessments and safety checks. Colonial moves more than 100 million gallons of fuel a day on its 5,500-mile pipe network from the Gulf Coast to Linden, N.J.
The Plantation Pipeline also ships gasoline from the region to the East Coast and was still operating, but Kinder Morgan Inc. said its terminal in Baton Rouge had lost power, which could affect the pipeline by Monday or Tuesday. The company was checking on the extent of damage to its facilities in Baton Rouge and said the power company was determining the repairs needed to restore power.
Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. said it mobilized crews to assess any damage to its facilities or nearby areas.
Offshore oil companies in the U.S. waters of the Gulf of Mexico, which account for about 17% of U.S. oil production and 5% of natural-gas output, had almost completely shut off flows from their production platforms and had evacuated more than half of them, according to a Monday report from the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.
That took about 1.72 million barrels a day of oil production and 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of natural-gas output offline.
Shell said late Sunday it scheduled a flyover to assess the storm's impact to its four major offshore platforms Monday afternoon.

The price of gasoline has been elevated in recent months, and overall demand for fuel looks likely to rebound more substantially next year. But all is not well for the companies that refine crude oil to make that fuel. Indeed, the outlook for U.S. refiners is looking pretty bleak.
That's one takeaway from a new report from Citigroup analyst Prashant Rao, who downgraded several stocks in the industry because of a series of negative trends.
One big problem is that companies around the world are building more refineries, but demand isn't rising quite as fast. That's generally a bad sign for refiners, and could portend weak margins ahead. By the end of 2024, capacity additions could outpace refinery closures or conversions by 1.1 million barrels a day, and demand growth is unlikely to fill that gap, Rao projects.
The second problem for U.S. refineries is that they have lost some of their geographic advantage. For years, oil produced in the U.S. has traded for less money than oil produced elsewhere. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, has typically traded for a few dollars less than Brent crude, the international benchmark. Some of that has to do with the difficulty of transporting U.S. crude — pipeline capacity has been slow to grow in some key areas. Crude oil can build up at hubs and in storage tanks and cause prices to slump.
But oil inventories are declining as producers have cut back on new projects, and WTI is trading at a smaller discount to Brent. U.S. refiners like wide spreads because they can buy oil cheap and sell products at higher margins overseas. Now, that advantage is disappearing , and Rao expects the trend to continue. WTI was trading at a discount of less than $4 to Brent on Thursday, down from more than $7 in 2018.
In general, investors have reduced the amount they are willing to pay for refiners, Rao writes. Their valuations for the stocks based on their mid-cycle earnings are down 20% from 2019 levels, he estimates.
Based in part on that re-rating, Rao thinks several refiners are less attractive investments now. He downgraded Delek US Holdings (ticker: DK) to Sell from Neutral, and CVR Energy (CVI) and Phillips 66 (PSX) to Neutral from Buy. On Thursday, Delek fell 2.6%, CVR was down 3.1%, and Phillips 66 was lower by 1.9%.
In the longer-term, Rao thinks that refinery stocks will need other attributes to make them attractive. He likes Valero Energy (VLO), for instance, because it has a promising low-carbon energy business. The company has been making money lately in renewable diesel , among other areas. Valero was down 0.8% on Thursday.
Rao also upgraded Marathon Petroleum (MPC) to Buy because he thinks that the company has made progress at cutting costs and is improving its return on capital. Nonetheless, he lowered his price target on the stock to $67. It was trading down 0.5% on Thursday to $58.35.

The oil and gas industry is stepping up lobbying efforts to dilute looming rules that mandate climate-change disclosures, in a sign of the fierce corporate resistance to a tougher new environmental regime in Washington.
Lobbying reports show an increase in arm-twisting at the Securities and Exchange Commission by individual companies and industry groups as the regulator drafts mandatory climaterelated financial disclosures. Some companies are approaching the SEC for the first time, according to Senate lobbying disclosures.
Gary Gensler, SEC chair, said this week he wanted the agency to put forward its proposals for mandatory climate reporting — intended to provide investors with consistent and comparable information to evaluate companies' climate risks — by the end of the year.
""When it comes to climate risk disclosures, investors are raising their hands and asking regulators for more,"" he said. ""I think we can bring greater clarity to climate risk disclosures.""
Refiner Phillips 66 and oilfield services group Baker Hughes started lobbying the SEC for the first time this year, the reports show. Both groups listed climate disclosures as their sole SEC lobbying issue.
Others, including ConocoPhillips, the world's largest independent producer, and the US wing of BP, restarted lobbying the SEC this year after steering clear of the agency for seven and five years respectively. Trade groups have also intensified their lobbying efforts. ""We are having, and plan to have additional, conversations,"" said Stephen Comstock, vice-president of corporate policy at the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's most powerful Washington lobby group.
""The dialogue is good and the questions are solid. So I consider them to be valuable conversations for sure.""
The API said it wanted the SEC to spare companies from having to report climate disclosures in annual 10k reports where the legal liability is greater for them. It is also concerned about the practicalities of reporting indirect emissions — those from the burning of fuels by customers. Gensler said the SEC was weighing whether to require disclosures on these so-called scope 3 emissions.
""To appropriately address liability considerations"", new climate-related disclosures should be ""not filed"" in regulatory documents, the oil major Chevron said in a letter to the SEC.
BP also wrote to the regulator, saying that new rules should allow companies to determine the most appropriate methodology for calculating emissions from their own operations. It said in a statement that it supported the SEC adopting new disclosure requirements for climate change.
Baker Hughes declined to comment, as did Phillips 66. ConocoPhillips did not respond to requests for comment.
President Joe Biden has promised to treat climate change with a sense of urgency. In May, the president directed Janet Yellen, Treasury secretary, to work with the other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which includes the SEC, to report how they planned to ""reduce risks to financial stability"".
Gensler is also facing pressure to deliver US climate reporting rules before the UN climate change conference, known as COP26, in November.
Oil and gas lobbying groups have said the SEC risked straying beyond its mandate if it required climate information that was not deemed ""material"" to investors. The materiality question would underpin any potential corporatefunded lawsuit to stop the climate rules after the SEC finalises them, sources have said.
The oil and gas sector's lobbying comes as companies scramble to portray themselves as eco-friendly amid the boom in environmental, social and governance investing.
""It would be disappointing to learn that companies that have said that they are self-proclaimed leaders in addressing climate change are trying to block common sense disclosure rules on that same issue,"" said Andrew Logan, senior director for oil and gas at Ceres, a non-profit that co-ordinates investor climate action.
""There's a critical need for the SEC just to set very basic guidelines requiring companies to disclose their emissions in the standardised way."" Patrick Temple-West and Myles McCormick in New York

------------

Warren Buffett is buying a new stock but doesn't want to spill the beans just yet.
It appears the famed investor secured permission from regulators to not disclose his ongoing purchase in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing for the third quarter, which was published on Monday.
""Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the US Securities and Exchange Commission,"" the filing reads.

The Berkshire chief probably wants more time to grow his nascent stake. Revealing it might spur other investors to buy the same stock, driving up the price that Buffett has to pay.
""He is undoubtedly building a large position now and may reveal it in his next 13F,"" David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who has closely followed Buffett for more than 30 years, told Business Insider.
""Buffett has received confidentiality treatment several times in the past,"" Kass continued. ""I believe most recently around 2015 he was building a position in Phillips 66.""
Indeed, the confidentiality clause appears in Berkshire's 13F for the second quarter of 2015, published in August of that year. Buffett and his team disclosed a $2.5 billion stake in Phillips 66 in an amended 13F filing a few weeks later.

Berkshire's 13F forms for the first and second quarters of 2011 also excluded a holding ""pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.""
A flurry of filings in November of that year revealed Buffett's company had been buying IBM, growing its stake in the computing giant from 4.5 million shares in March, to 24.8 million shares in June, then 57.3 million shares worth more than $10 billion at the end of September.
Buffett and his team appear to be keeping an investment confidential once again.
""I suspect that Berkshire is building a large position in a public company and they would like to continue to do that before disclosing it,"" James Shanahan, an Edward Jones analyst who covers Berkshire, told Business Insider.
Berkshire's third-quarter earnings pegged the value of its equity portfolio on September 30 at $245 billion excluding Kraft Heinz, Shanahan pointed out. However, its 13F filing showed only $220 billion in holdings.
The company's roughly $6 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses over the 12 months to August only partly accounts for that difference in value, he added. The covert investment might be the missing link.

In a low-rate world, high yields of up to 10% still are available in the U.S. stock market, but risk often comes with those lofty dividends.
Barron's screened the S&P 500 for the stocks with the highest dividend yields, based on data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. We excluded energy pipeline companies and real-estate investment trusts which emphasize different accounting than most traditional corporations.
In what may surprise many investors, Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM), whose shares are off over 50% this year, is near the top of the list with a 10.2% yield. Exxon's status marks quite a comedown for the energy giant; a decade ago, it was the most valuable company in the U.S. stock market.
Other notables include Altria Group (MO), AT&T (T), Chevron (CVX), Philip Morris International (PM), and refiner Phillips 66 (PSX).

What to Expect from Microsoft Earnings

With high yielders, dividend sustainability is critical. Barron's calculated the dividend payout ratios based on projected 2021 earnings. Five of the companies—telecom provider Lumen Technologies (LUMN), Altria, AT&T, Phillips 66, and Philip Morris International—cover their dividends.
Altria, the producer of Marlboro cigarettes, boosted its dividend by 2% in July, signaling confidence in its payout. At around $39, Altria yields nearly 9%. Morgan Stanley analyst Pamela Kaufman has written that she views the dividend as ""secure,"" with the company generating about $1.4 billion of annual free cash flow in excess of the dividend.
Philip Morris International, a leading overseas tobacco company that used to be joined with Altria, trades around $74 and yields 6.5%. Philip Morris, which is promoting a heated tobacco product called IQOS as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes, lifted its dividend by 2.6% in September and reported a nearly 6% gain in third-quarter adjusted earnings per share. Cigarette makers like Altria and Philip Morris International tend to have high dividend payout ratios relative to other consumer companies.
The AT&T dividend is important to its investment story. With the stock around $28, the yield is 7.5%.
While analysts like Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson question the sustainability of the payout given the company's high debt levels and weakening trends at its DirecTV and entertainment businesses, the company said last week in conjunction with its third-quarter earnings release that it remains ""committed to supporting the dividend.""
The Exxon Mobil dividend has been the
subject of much speculation
on Wall Street because it is not covering the payout from earnings.
""Questions on dividend sustainability are reaching fever pitch,"" wrote Barclays analyst Jeanine Wai in a recent client note. ""It has become the No. 1 topic by far"" among investors.
When it reported second-quarter results in late July, Exxon said maintaining the dividend was a priority and that it would cut capital expenditures to free up cash. The company, however, has borrowed to fund the dividend, and doesn't want to add more debt to its balance sheet.
The stock market probably is pricing in a dividend cut, but Wai sees the Exxon Mobil payout maintained at least for this year with its sustainability hinging on oil prices.
Analysts view Chevron's dividend as safer than Exxon's. Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta wrote recently that Chevron should cover its dividend from 2021 free cash flow while he projects that Exxon will come up about $4 billion short. Both Exxon and Chevron likely will have more to say about their dividends when they report third-quarter results later this week.
Four refiners—Philips, Valero Energy (VLO), and HollyFrontier (HFC) and Marathon Petroleum (MPC)—make the list. The industry has been hit this year by weaker demand, particularly for jet fuel, and refining margins are depressed. The four stocks all are down by more than 50% so far in 2020.
None now covers its dividend. Phillips, probably the strongest member of the group thanks to a diversified business model that includes a large chemicals business, barely covers its dividend based on projected 2021 earnings.
Valero, whose stock is around $42, recently backed its dividend, which now offers a 9.3% yield.
""We basically feel we're a long way from rethinking the dividend,"" Valero's chief financial officer, Jason Fraser, on the company's earnings conference call last week. He cited the company's ample liquidity, including $4 billion in cash."" Yet Valero is in the red, having lost an adjusted $1.16 a share in the quarter.
""Based on our math, VLO's balance sheet will fund the dividend through most of 2021, with full dividend coverage in a future 2022 normalized world,"" wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh in a note after the report. ""How things play out with the dividend versus balance sheet debate for the entire industry will come down to the pace of product demand and margin recovery.""
Marathon Petroleum, at around $30, yields 7.8%. Its balance sheet will be substantially strengthened by its deal to sell its Speedway gasoline and convenience store business to the Japanese parent of 7-Eleven for $21 billion.
Phillips 66 has emphasized its ""secure, competitive and growing dividend."" It reports third-quarter results later this week.
HollyFrontier, which has said it aims to pay a ""competitive and sustainable dividend,"" reports third-quarter earnings in early November.
Lumen Technologies, formerly CenturyLink, cuts its dividend by more than 50% in early 2019 to $1 a share, and the current payout appears sustainable based on both earnings and free cash flow. Lumen is expected to earn about $1.30 a share in 2021.
Lumen CEO Jeff Storey said on the second-quarter conference call that ""our ability to support our dividend speaks for itself with a payout ratio in the 30s."" He was measuring dividends relative to free cash flow, which exceeds reported earnings.
The company provides business and consumer telecom services as well as data transmission. Some analysts see pressure on its business and consumer operation with the company's stock price cut in half during the past two years.

California's goals for cleaner motor fuels are sparking changes at big US oil refiners, as they retool to make a form of diesel from cooking oil cast off by restaurants and animal fats rendered at slaughterhouses.
Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66 and HollyFrontier are among the refiners exploring or pursuing projects to produce ""renewable diesel"", which can substitute petroleum-based diesel in trucks and buses and can be made with some of the same equipment.
The moves come as the pandemic knocks US oil demand, forcing refiners to curtail volumes. Yet in renewable diesel they have an opportunity to expand. The incentive is in tougher emissions policies in California. The state's lowcarbon fuel standard was designed to hasten a shift to transport with lower greenhouse gas emissions, the main force driving climate change.
The low-carbon programme awards credits to suppliers of fuels whose emissions are lower than a state benchmark. Suppliers of carbon-heavy fuels such as petroleum-based diesel must purchase these credits to comply with state law.
As the benchmark tightens, the price of credits has soared to almost $200 a tonne of carbon dioxide, prompting more oil refiners to expand into fuels that receive carbon credits. Renewable diesel and a related fuel, biodiesel, typically earn more credits per gallon than other biofuels. Last year California used a combined 830m gallons of both types of diesel, accounting for 22 per cent of the total state diesel market, according to the National Biodiesel Board.
Phillips 66's refinery in Rodeo, California, would become the ""world's largest renewable fuels plant"", replacing its intake of crude oil with used cooking oil, fats, greases and soyabean oil, the company said. The plant will be able to supply 800m gallons a year of biofuels, mainly renewable diesel.
""We were seeing declining margins and a pretty poor business environment for this asset over time,"" said Nik Weinberg-Lynn, renewable energy projects manager at the Phillips 66 refinery. ""Making this move allowed us to operate in this community for a long period of time.""
Mr Weinberg-Lynn said that converting the Rodeo refinery to biofuels would help Phillips 66 offset the financial burden of carbon credits at the company's oil refinery in Los Angeles, which would continue to operate as usual.
California's fuel policy is having an impact outside the state. Marathon, the largest US oil refiner, is converting an oil refinery in Dickinson, North Dakota, to make 184m gallons a year of renewable diesel from corn and soyabean oil for sale to California. Last month it said it would close its oil refinery in Martinez, California, and explore repurposing it to make renewable diesel.
HollyFrontier called California the ""key driver of demand"" as it aims to produce more than 200m gallons a year of renewable diesel. It last month shut down its oil refinery in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with plans to convert it to renewable diesel production, and it is adding a renewable diesel facility next to its oil refinery in Artesia, New Mexico.
Other refiners involved in renewable diesel include Valero Energy, whose Diamond Green Diesel joint venture with the fats recycler Darling Ingredients is more than doubling the size of a plant in Louisiana to 675m gallons a year and is exploring construction of a new plant in Port Arthur, Texas.
US refiners are not abandoning petroleum. Their trade association supported the Trump administration's recent rollback of vehicle fuel economy standards, which the Environmental Protection Agency estimated would increase annual petrol consumption by 15bn gallons in 2050, compared with the earlier regulation. The refiners' trade association sued to block California's low-carbon fuel standard in 2010. Unsuccessful in court, refiners are now navigating the policy shift in the second-largest state market for liquid fuels.
The wholesale conventional diesel price is about $1.15 a gallon in Califoralso nia. Sellers of renewable diesel can receive extra revenue of about $3.50 a gallon from the California low-carbon fuel credits, a separate credit under the national renewable fuel programme and a $1 a gallon federal blender's tax credit, said Gary Greenstein, a refining consultant at S&P Global Platts. The credits compensate for the high production cost of renewable diesel.
Renewable diesel and biodiesel are both made from vegetable oils and animal fats. The social lockdowns of the coronavirus pandemic put pressure on that supply chain, said Harry Simpson, chief executive of Crimson Renewable Energy, a biodiesel refiner.
Supplies of used cooking oil collapsed as restaurants and cafeterias closed, he said. Closures of meatpacking plants in response to contagion among workers slowed the shipments of tallow from livestock, Mr Simpson added.
Crimson is expanding by half the capacity of its Bakersfield, California, biodiesel refinery to 36m gallons a year, adding equipment designed to handle lower-quality feedstocks, such as the gunk collected from restaurant grease traps, Mr Simpson said.

| Jump to first hitCharleston Mayor John Tecklenburg and other city officials have filed a lawsuit against 24 fossil fuel companies, in an attempt to hold them accountable for the city’s costs to adapt to climate change.

Tecklenburg made the announcement at a news conference on Wednesday, which he held at The Battery almost three years to the day after Hurricane Irma devastated the area with flooding.

The lawsuit asserts that the major corporate members of the fossil fuel industry oil, coal andnatural gas companies have known for nearly half a century that unrestricted production and use of fossil fuel products would create greenhouse gas pollution that would warm the planet and change the climate. It goes on to say that this has caused extreme and volatile weather, sea level rise and associated flooding, particularly in the Lowcountry.

“And instead of warning us, they covered up the truth and turned our flooding problems into their profits,” Tecklenburg said. “That was wrong, and this lawsuit is all about holding them accountable for their multidecade campaign of deception and sharing the burden of cost for what they have brought upon us.”

Casey Norton, corporate media relations manager at Exxon, one of the companies named in the suit, said in a statement that such lawsuits were a waste of money and do not result in reducing the effects of climate change.

“ExxonMobil will continue to invest in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting society’s growing demand for energy,” Norton said. “The claims are baseless and without merit. We look forward to defending the company in court.”

Within its more than 140 pages, the lawsuit addresses six causes of action, including public and private nuisance, strict liability and negligent failure to warn, and violations of South Carolina’s Unfair Trade Practices Act.

It also addresses the consequences specific to Charleston in particular, the increase of flooding events from four days a year 50 years ago to 89 in 2019 and the anticipated rise in temperature for the area. By 2070, the lawsuit said, the city anticipates 30 additional days a year of temperatures reaching higher than 95 degrees.

Additionally, the suit says the city has incurred significant expenses on capital projects to address the rising sea level, which Tecklenburg said has increased by 1 foot in the 100 years that it’s been measured. Scientists expect it to rise another 2 to 3 feet by 2070.

“The city seeks to ensure that the parties who have profited from externalizing the consequences and costs of dealing with global warming and its physical, environmental, social and economic consequences, bear the costs of those impacts on Charleston, rather than the city, taxpayers, residents, or broader segments of the public,” the lawsuit said.

| Jump to first hitThe latest sign of a worldwide energy transition: Massive oil refineries across the western U.S. are being converted into biofuel plants.
Phillips 66 on Wednesday became the latest in a string of U.S. refiners to say it's converting an oil refinery in California into a biofuel plant as gasoline loses its lustre to fuels derived from agricultural and waste products. The company said its 120,000 barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery near San Francisco will become the world's biggest plant that makes so-called renewable diesel, as well as gasoline and jet fuel, out of used cooking oil, fats, greases and soybean oils.
The announcement came about a week after fuel giant Marathon Petroleum Corp. said that it may convert two refineries into renewable diesel plants. In June, HollyFrontier Corp. said it would turn its Cheyenne, Wyoming, refinery into a renewable diesel plant by 2022.
As refiners across the U.S. struggle with depressed fuel demand and an uncertain future amid the pandemic, California's fight against global warming is offering a pathway to survival. Demand for socalled renewable diesel is surging in the Golden State where fuel suppliers buy credits from clean energy producers to make up for their emissions as part of a program that's designed to cut the region's transportation-related emissions 20 per cent by 2030.
""There is overcapacity on the refining market,"" Marijn van der Wal, biofuel adviser at Stratas Advisers in Singapore, said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""Are we going to shut down our refineries or are we going to repurpose them?"" The LCFS credits as well as federal RIN D5 credits and recently reintroduced Blenders Tax Credits generate about US$3.32 a gallon in subsidies for renewable diesel producers, sufficient to cover production costs, Van der Wal said in a report last June.
""It's a mind-boggling amount of money,"" he said by phone. ""You will make a lot of money as long as all these subsidies come in.""
The Rodeo plant is well suited for conversion because of its dock and rail access for receiving the tallows, vegetable oils and used cooking oils that will feed into plant, Nik Weinberg-Lynn, manager of renewable energy projects at Phillips 66, said by phone.
The facility has two hydrocrackers that are important to the conversion process as well a plentiful supply of hydrogen. In addition, the plant is located where demand is strongest.
""The California market for the renewable diesel product is certainly the largest in the world,"" he said.
Phillips 66 plans to invest US$700 million to US$800 million in the conversion including constructing pre-treatment facilities, Weinberg-Lynn said. The Rodeo plant could start operating as early as 2024, producing 680 million gallons a year of about 70 per cent renewable diesel, 10 per cent gasoline, and 20 per cent jet fuel, the company said.
The San Francisco refinery has an additional project under way that is expected to start up in the second quarter of 2021 and will produce 120 million gallons a year of renewable diesel. Phillips 66 also announced it would be closing its 45,000 barrel-a-day plant in Santa Maria in 2023. The shutdown comes after years of declining retail gasoline sales in the state, according to Energy Information Administration data.
Last week, Marathon said it will convert its 166,000 barrel-a-day Martinez, California, refinery into a terminal facility and that may include a 48,000 barrel-aday renewable diesel plant as soon as 2022. The company is turning its 19,000 barrel-a-day North Dakota plant into a renewable diesel plant by the end of this year. Earlier this week, Exxon Mobil Corp. signed an agreement with Global Clean Energy Holdings Inc. to buy 2.5 million barrels a year of renewable diesel for five years from a converted Bakersfield refinery.
The surge of new entrants into the California renewable diesel market is creating its own problems, Van der Wal said. So many projects are being proposed that there may not be sufficient diesel demand in California to absorb the additional fuel. Also, existing renewable diesel suppliers to California, including Neste SA and Valero Energy Corp., have locked up much of the feedstock, leaving less tallow and cooking oil for the newcomers.
Phillips 66 hasn't yet secured all the necessary feedstock for the plant but is confident it can, Weinberg-Lynn said.
""We do firmly believe, while it will be a challenge, that there is enough,"" he said.

The rise of invisible power plants
There are no smokestacks, no wind turbines. There's no facility at all.
The power comes, instead, from hundreds of backup batteries inside homes across the country. When they collectively release energy to the grid, they can generate a similar amount of electricity to a traditional power plant.
That's the thinking behind Sunrun's ""virtual"" power plant model.
The company's main product is rooftop solar panels, but it also sells loads of batteries that store backup power. Batteries are big business for Sunrun, as the company's CEO told investors on Monday.Sunrun makes money selling them to solar customers, but the firm is also turning those batteries into virtual power plants (VPPs), which are driving a separate stream of revenue.
For a closer look at the future of Sunrun and what its planned acquisition of Vivint Solar means for its battery strategy, check out our full story here.

Big oil companies bet on fusion, biofuel
Fusion: It's the same process that powers the sun, and now oil giant Chevron is betting that it will be part of the future of energy.
On Wednesday, the company said it's investing in Zap Energy, a Seattle-based fusion startup. Chevron isn't ready to join some of its peers in eschewing oil, but it does want some skin in the clean-energy game. We talked to the president of Chevron Technology Ventures, its venture arm, which has $350 million in investments. Check out the interview here. 
Biofuel: This week, Phillips 66, a major oil refiner, announced it was transforming one of its big refineries into a renewable fuel plant.
The Houston-based company says the updated plant will be the largest renewable fuel plant in the world. The plant will turn used cooking oil, fats, greases, and soybean oil into diesel, gasoline, and jet fuel for the California market, which has a low-carbon-fuel standard. Fine print: Phillips 66 also said it would shut down its Santa Maria refinery in Arroyo Grande, California, in 2023, potentially putting more than 100 jobs at risk.

Bankruptcy watch: 15 oil companies at risk
More than 30 North American oil exploration and production companies have filed for bankruptcy since the start of the year — up about two thirds since the same period last year, according to the law firm Haynes and Boone.
More bankruptcies are likely on the horizon, thanks to cheap oil, which makes production far less profitable.
Price check: Brent crude is down 32% since the start of the year, stalled at around $45 a barrel. ""It is reasonable to expect that a substantial number of producers will continue to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy even if oil prices recover over the next few months,"" the firm said. 
At risk: Fitch Ratings shared its list of ""top bonds of concern"" for oil and gas companies, which includes the companies most likely to default on their debt.

The company's 120,000 barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery near San Francisco will become the world's biggest plant that makes so-called renewable diesel, as well as gasoline and jet fuel, out of used cooking oil, fats, greases and soybean oils. The announcement came about a week after Marathon Petroleum Corp. said that it may convert two refineries into renewable diesel plants. In June, HollyFrontier Corp. said it would turn its Cheyenne, Wyoming, refinery into a renewable diesel plant by 2022.

U.S. fuel makers see economic opportunity in getting greener as consumption remains depressed during the coronavirus pandemic and the prospect of more government regulations increases.
Phillips 66 said it is planning to transform a San Francisco-area oil refinery into a plant that produces fuels from products such as vegetable oil and animal fat, which generate less soot and fewer greenhouse gases.
The conversion, slated for completion in 2024, is expected to require around $800 million in capital investment and is one of several similar projects proposed in recent months, as U.S. refiners re-evaluate their businesses in light of Covid-19 and tightening environmental regulations.
The coronavirus pandemic has crushed demand for fuels such as gasoline and jet fuel, and many expect global oil consumption to remain depressed for years. But appetite for so-called renewable fuel is poised to grow because of government regulations in places such as California that are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
""The economic conditions are ripe for it,"" Bob Herman, Phillips 66's refining chief, said of the refinery conversion. He added that the company's San Francisco-area facility isn't making money as a traditional refinery.
Phillips 66's converted facility would largely produce a biofuel known as renewable diesel that is interchangeable with conventional diesel. Other types of biofuels, such as biodiesel and ethanol, must be blended with conventional refined products.
Renewable diesel generally isn't economical to produce without government incentives, and demand is small, said John Auers, an executive vice president at consulting firm Turner, Mason & Co. The fuel makes up around 1% of U.S. diesel consumption, largely driven by fuel regulations in California. The state aims by 2030 to reduce the carbon intensity of its transportation fuels by 20% compared with 2010 levels.
As California's rules become stricter and other states consider adopting similar rules, U.S. renewable-diesel consumption is projected to roughly double over the next decade to around 1.1 billion gallons a year, according to Turner Mason.
Mr. Herman said over the next decade, as California's fuel standards ramp up, the need for renewable fuels would become onerous if Phillips 66 weren't producing its own biofuel and instead had to buy credits.
Other fuel makers including Marathon Petroleum Corp. and a smaller rival, HollyFrontier Corp., see similar opportunities. Marathon said last week it is considering converting a California refinery it closed this spring to a renewable-diesel facility. HollyFrontier said in June it plans to close a Wyoming refinery and transition it to renewable-diesel production, as well as build additional capacity in New Mexico to process the materials used in renewable diesel.
HollyFrontier Chief Executive Michael Jennings attributed the decision to convert the Wyoming refinery in part to reduced margins on traditional oil refining because of the pandemic. ""Demand for renewable diesel as well as other low-carbon fuels is growing and taking market share, based on both consumer preference and support from substantial federal and state government incentive programs,"" Mr. Jennings said in a call with investors.
Exxon Mobil Corp., meanwhile, said this week it had signed a deal to buy 2.5 million barrels, or around 100 million gallons, of renewable diesel a year for five years from a California facility that is being converted from an oil refinery.
Renewable diesel typically generates less soot than its petroleum-based counterpart and less than 40% of the greenhouse-gas emissions per unit of energy, measuring from production through consumption, said Robert McCormick, a senior research fellow with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

US oil refiner Phillips 66, recognized by its logo attached to gas stations across the country, is converting a crude oil refinery in California into the world's largest renewable fuel plant, the company said Wednesday.
Located in Rodeo, California, the reconfigured plant will turn used cooking oil, fats, greases, and soybean oils into more sustainable gasoline and diesel.
The announcement comes as crude oil prices are down more than 30%, indicating that demand for low-emissions fuels remains even when the traditional feedstock is cheap. California, where the fuel will be sold, has a low carbon fuel standard that adds value to fuels that yield lower carbon emissions.
""This capital-efficient investment is expected to deliver strong returns through the sale of high-value products while lowering the plant's operating costs,"" the company said in a statement.

The facility — which is already home to an existing but smaller sustainable fuels project — could produce more than 800 million gallons of renewable fuel each year by 2024, the company said, pending regulatory approval.
Based in Houston, Phillips 66, which spun off from ConocoPhillips in 2012, operates 13 refineries in the US and Europe and has a market value of $28 billion.

Lowering emissions through biodiesel
Once the transformation is complete, the facility, called Rodeo Renewed, will emit 50% less carbon dioxide and 75% less sulfur dioxide, an air pollutant, than the existing refinery, the company says. Phillips 66 does not have a companywide emissions reduction target.
Phillips 66 will source oils, such as vegetable oil, which is used heavily in the fast-food industry as a frying oil, both domestically and globally, Joe Gannon, a company representative, told Business Insider. The biofuel will be ""a 'drop-in' product that works in any traditional diesel vehicle and does not require blending,"" he said.
Phillips 66 is among a handful of big oil companies including HollyFrontier Corp and CVR Energy, that have been exploring the production of biodiesel, Reuters reports. Phillips 66 has a handful of other low-carbon fuel projects, located in the UK and Nevada, according to the company.

The fuel maker plans to continue operating the facility as a traditional refinery while it pursues the conversion.
Phillips 66 and a partner called off plans earlier this year to build a renewable-diesel plant in Washington state, but Mr. Herman said he expects a smoother permitting process for this project because Phillips 66 is converting an existing facility rather than constructing a new one.

U.S. fuel makers slashed production during the second quarter as they reeled from a historic decline in demand for gasoline and jet fuel.
Long a bright spot in the oil patch, refiners such as Valero Energy Corp., Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Phillips 66 pumped the brakes as the coronavirus pandemic kept people off the roads and out of the skies, crushing demand for the fuels they produce.
U.S. consumption of gasoline and distillates including diesel has rebounded from its April trough to more than 90% of year-ago levels, Energy Information Administration data show. But demand for jet fuel remains anemic, at little more than half of last year's level, a sign that global oil demand is likely to remain depressed for years.
World-wide, fuel makers have coped by processing far less crude, shutting down some facilities and constraining spending. This year's average global refinery utilization rates are expected to be the lowest in 37 years, according to the International Energy Agency. Refiners typically make less money when they operate well below capacity because the cost of running their facilities doesn't decline by much.
In the latest sign of pressure on the sector, Marathon told employees Friday that it has no plans to restart two refineries that it idled in April. The company had tried unsuccessfully to sell one of the facilities, Chief Executive Michael Hennigan said Monday.
Marathon on Sunday evening also announced that it was selling its gas-station business to the owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain for $21 billion in the largest U.S. energy-related deal so far this year.
U.S. refiners' second-quarter results provide a glimpse of the challenging future that fuel makers face as tougher fuel-efficiency requirements and electric vehicles threaten their businesses.
That is the reality already facing refiners in Europe, where demand for transportation fuels had fallen even before the pandemic.
""To a degree, the pandemic is a harbinger of the coming energy transition more broadly, where oil demand declines year after year,"" said Kurt Barrow, a vice president at analytics firm IHS Markit.
Phillips 66 ran its refineries at 75% of capacity during the second quarter, down from 97% in the same period a year earlier. Its refining business lost $878 million pretax during the period, whereas in the year-ago period it generated $983 million in pretax profit.
The company's margin on each barrel of oil that it processed fell to $2.60 from $11.37 a year earlier. That contributed to a second-quarter loss of $141 million, compared with profit of $1.4 billion in the year-ago period.
Valero processed some 22% less crude during the second quarter than it did a year earlier, and its margin per barrel fell to $5.10 from $9.58. The company largely reversed the $2.5 billion inventory write-down that it took during the first quarter, as oil prices roughly doubled from the end of March to the end of June.
That reversal helped to lift Valero's second-quarter profit to $1.3 billion from $612 million in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time adjustments, the company reported a $504 million loss, compared with $665 million in profit during the same period last year.
Valero executives said the company is refining more oil to meet improving demand but cautioned that jet-fuel consumption remains severely depressed.
""That would be the only sign that we're seeing that's a little bit troubling,"" Valero Chief Commercial Officer Gary Simmons told investors last week.
Many observers expect jet-fuel consumption to remain low for years, as people avoid flying because of the coronavirus and businesses conduct more meetings by videoconference, constraining global oil demand.
By the end of next year, the IEA expects world oil consumption will be about 2% below levels from late 2019. Some refineries likely will have to shut down, much as they did after the 2007-09 recession, when some eight million barrels a day of refining capacity permanently closed, according to the IEA.
""There is going to be continued rationalization,"" Thomas Nimbley, chief executive of New Jersey-based PBF Energy Inc., told investors last week.
PBF ran about 21% less oil through its systems during the second quarter than it did a year earlier as its margin on each barrel plummeted to $1.54 from $9.10. The company generated $413 million in second-quarter profit versus a year-ago loss of $22 million, thanks in part to asset sales and an increase in inventory value.
Mr. Nimbley said PBF is focused on weathering the pandemic and reducing debt, at which point it will look to diversify into areas such as renewable diesel, a fuel made from products such as vegetable oil or grease.
Refiners are increasingly interested in alternative fuels. Marathon, for example, is considering converting one of the refineries it closed this spring to a facility that produces renewable diesel.
Marathon ran its refineries at 71% of capacity during the quarter, down from 97% during the same period a year earlier. Its margin-per-barrel declined to $7.13, from $15.24 a year earlier.
The company partially reversed a $3.2 billion inventory charge it took earlier this year, helping to lift first-quarter profits to $9 million, compared with $1.1 billion a year prior. Excluding one-time adjustments, Marathon had a quarterly loss of $868 million, compared with a $1.1 billion profit a year earlier.
IHS, the analytics firm, expects global oil consumption will surpass 2019 levels in 2023 and continue to grow at least through the end of the decade, yet remain far lower than it would have been had the pandemic never happened. Others such as Rystad Energy think world oil demand will peak before the end of the decade as electric vehicles gain market share and people travel less.
Either scenario is challenging for fuel makers.
U.S. refining companies raked in cash in recent years, despite relatively flat domestic fuel consumption, because of an uptick in exports and a shale boom that outpaced domestic pipeline infrastructure. Soaring production created crude bottlenecks in pockets of the U.S. and regional price dislocations that fuel makers took advantage of.
Such severe regional price disparities are unlikely to re-emerge soon because U.S. oil production has fallen to around 11 million barrels a day, from some 13 million barrels a day earlier this year, relieving pressure on the conduits that move crude around the country, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research for Morningstar Inc. For those looking to unload weaker assets, buyers are few and far between.
""They're in the same boat as the European refiners have been in for years, which is too many refineries, not enough demand,"" Mr. Fielden said.

For this newsletter, I wanted to highlight two recent stories that embody the power of digital transformation and prove how critical those technological overhauls suddenly became when the pandemic struck.
At Boston Scientific, the medical device manufacturer was already four years into its own transformation.
Much of that time was spent on basic IT work, like hardware improvements. But the company also propped up new innovation studios that are proving critical during the sudden surge in interest in telemedicine.
Investment in an automated information dashboard made it easier for executives to analyze critical data that, prior to COVID-19, might have been viewed quarterly — it quickly became a daily dispatch to help plot out Boston Scientific's response to the outbreak.
""It's because we made all of those changes in the last few years that we were so well-positioned to make the swift, dramatic changes that COVID forced upon us,"" CIO Jodi Eddy told Business Insider in a July interview.
Phillips 66 was dealing with entirely different struggles. The energy giant started its own tech transformation in 2017 when the oil and gas industry was beginning to pick-up again after a rocky few years.
It moved 80% of its workload to the cloud and worked with SAP to build a new software platform around its popular S/4HANA tool. The system makes it easier to analyze data across organizations because it integrates information from many aspects of the business — including manufacturing, finance, and human resources.
Then the coronavirus hit, decimating demand and sending prices plummeting.
Now, the the pandemic is not only pushing along the overhaul, it also helped the company quickly cut $700 million in spending, according to Chief Digital Officer Zhanna Golodryga.
""It's very hard to transform where the company is doing extremely well,"" she told Business Insider. ""It's much easier when everyone is under pressure and you have to take some efforts and measures really fast.

PBF ran about 21% less oil through its systems during the second quarter than it did a year earlier as its margin on each barrel plummeted to $1.54 from $9.10. The company generated $413 million in second-quarter profit versus a year-ago loss of $22 million, thanks in part to asset sales and an increase in inventory value.
Mr. Nimbley said PBF is focused on weathering the pandemic and reducing debt, at which point it will look to diversify into areas such as renewable diesel, a fuel made from products such as vegetable oil or grease.
Refiners are increasingly interested in alternative fuels. Marathon, for example, is considering converting one of the refineries it closed this spring to a facility that produces renewable diesel.
Marathon ran its refineries at 71% of capacity during the quarter, down from 97% during the same period a year earlier. Its margin-per-barrel declined to $7.13, from $15.24 a year earlier.
The company partially reversed a $3.2 billion inventory charge it took earlier this year, helping to lift first-quarter profits to $9 million, compared with $1.1 billion a year prior. Excluding one-time adjustments, Marathon had a quarterly loss of $868 million, compared with a $1.1 billion profit a year earlier.
IHS, the analytics firm, expects global oil consumption will surpass 2019 levels in 2023 and continue to grow at least through the end of the decade, yet remain far lower than it would have been had the pandemic never happened. Others such as Rystad Energy think world oil demand will peak before the end of the decade as electric vehicles gain market share and people travel less.
Either scenario is challenging for fuel makers.
U.S. refining companies raked in cash in recent years, despite relatively flat domestic fuel consumption, because of an uptick in exports and a shale boom that outpaced domestic pipeline infrastructure. Soaring production created crude bottlenecks in pockets of the U.S. and regional price dislocations that fuel makers took advantage of .
Such severe regional price disparities are unlikely to re-emerge soon because U.S. oil production has fallen to around 11 million barrels a day, from some 13 million barrels a day earlier this year, relieving pressure on the conduits that move crude around the country, said Sandy Fielden, director of oil and products research for Morningstar Inc. For those looking to unload weaker assets, buyers are few and far between.
""They're in the same boat as the European refiners have been in for years, which is too many refineries, not enough demand,"" Mr. Fielden said.

Employees of Phillips 66 got the message in mid-May.
The Houston-based oil refiner couldn't have a viable business if people didn't return to their daily commutes, Chief Executive Greg Garland said in an internal video seen by The Wall Street Journal. Phillips 66 would have to do its part.
""If we in the energy business are reluctant to go back to the office, why should other people go back? How can we get our economy going again?"" he said in the video.
By early June, Phillips 66 had recalled the majority of its employees to its main Houston office, which houses around 2,300 people. It has stayed mostly full as Texas has emerged as a hot spot for new infections that have strained the state's hospital system. Employees at the company have been discussing what they describe as lax safety protocols on issues like masks and an onerous approval process to work from home, according to several people familiar with the conversations.
Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss said the company has continuously updated protocols based on direction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local guidance and employee feedback, and he didn't dispute Mr. Garland's video message. The company has said its federal designation as critical to U.S. infrastructure exempts it from state rules on workplace capacity. Phillips 66 ""understands that some employees have concerns"" and made accommodations for high-risk employees and caregivers of high-risk family members to work from home, Mr. Nuss said.
""We firmly believe that we have a safe workplace which allows us to continue with an essential business for the nation,"" he said. ""The practices put in place at Phillips 66 demonstrate that it is possible to both reopen many of our businesses while protecting the health and safety of the workforce.""
As parts of the U.S. economy attempt to reopen, companies and institutions are taking various approaches to getting people back to work as coronavirus infections surge across the U.S. With more than 3.4 million confirmed cases nationwide and a death toll topping 136,000, employers say they are operating under unprecedented circumstances with no universal guidelines, making it difficult to balance workers' safety and financial exigencies after months of inactivity. The result is a segment of the workforce ranging from baseball players to bankers who say they feel undue pressure to report for duty.
Employees of Credit Agricole Group received an email on June 8 from Marc-Andre Poirier, senior regional officer for the Americas at the financial firm's corporate and investment-banking unit, saying that all New York City employees would start returning to the office in phases beginning on June 15. Some would be told to return full-time while others would rotate in and out of the office in assigned groups, according to the email, which was viewed by the Journal.
Employees with pre-existing medical conditions were told to contact human resources. One employee who went through the bank's process of asking not to return to the office due to an elevated health risk was told the bank saw no reason for him not to return, according to an email viewed by the Journal. If he decided his health risk prevented him from returning, he was told, he could use vacation days, request unpaid time off or apply for short-term disability leave.
""There's pressure for people to go in,"" said another employee. Aside from health risks, the return process created logistical challenges. Employees who were supposed to return on June 15 were notified days before, leaving parents with little time to arrange for child care.
A document titled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" attached to Mr. Poirier's June 8 email said that with respect to child care, ""It is each employee's responsibility to make sure he or she is able to come back to work when required to do so.""
A Credit Agricole spokeswoman said the firm has made every effort to protect its employees during the pandemic. She said it is closely regulating the number of employees in the office and conducting health screenings by using questionnaires and on-site nurses. She added the firm doesn't comment on the private health of its employees but that it is complying with all laws related to employee health, privacy and safety.
Since Phillips 66 began calling workers back to work, Covid-19 cases in its home state have surged. Texas has reported a total 275,058 positive cases as of Tuesday, with about 77% of those emerging since the end of May, according to the state's health department. The state also hit a record in new daily cases Tuesday, with a single-day increase of 10,745, the data show.
Several other large energy companies in Houston, including Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC's U.S. subsidiary Shell Oil Co. and Total SA, have kept most of their employees working remotely throughout the pandemic, with some pulling those who had returned to offices back home as the fourth-largest U.S. city became a coronavirus hot spot.
Phillips 66's Mr. Garland said in the May video that employees had proved they could work remotely, but staying home until a vaccine was available wasn't an option for the economy, the energy industry or the company. The effects of the pandemic could cost the company $3.2 billion in the first half of the year, he said. In addition, he said limiting workers to teleconferences and video meetings would make it impossible to tap into the creativity and productivity generated by office encounters.
The company has had 39 cases of Covid-19 at its Houston headquarters so far, representing less than 2% of the workforce there, according to an internal dashboard viewed by the Journal.
Mr. Nuss, the spokesman, said Phillips 66 has monitored, isolated or quarantined employees as necessary. As of July 10, it hadn't seen any evidence of workplace spread ""when employees adhere to our protection practices,"" and contact tracing shows most positive cases result from exposures outside the headquarters office. None of the known cases have resulted in hospitalizations, he said.
When its office reopened, Phillips 66 didn't require employees to wear masks in several common areas until late June, employees said. In mid-June, when Harris County ordered businesses to mandate face coverings, the firm said in an email viewed by the Journal that the order applied to businesses that provided goods and services directly to the public, which the company doesn't do at its corporate headquarters.
When the county raised its coronavirus threat level to the most severe near the end of the month, the company told employees in an email it wouldn't be changing its office staffing levels. It adjusted its policy on masks to require all employees and contractors to wear face coverings in common areas, when people weren't sitting at their desks or in meetings where social distancing was inadequate.
Employees said some managers have encouraged workers not to criticize leadership decisions.
""We are unaware of any such instructions or directives by individual managers,"" Mr. Nuss said. The company also ""rejects any suggestion that Phillips 66 discourages the input of its employees, positive or negative,"" he said.
Since March, Mr. Nuss said, the company's emergency operations center has routinely evaluated and adjusted its plans and protocols based on employee feedback and authorities' guidance. The company has surveyed employees, who get weekly updates from executives through internal videos, podcasts and virtual meetings.
Employees who live with or are themselves medically vulnerable can seek the company's high-risk designation to work remotely, after submitting documentation from their health-care providers, in line with the Americans With Disabilities Act, Mr. Nuss said. Many employees who have requested that status were identified and have worked from home, he said.
In internal communication to employees on the company's pandemic pay policy, Phillips 66 said primary caregivers of children attending closed schools or day care would be able to work remotely for an additional workweek to find alternate child care following a business unit's transition back to the office. Employees unable to work remotely could take up to one week of paid time off to find alternate child care.
Mr. Nuss said company officials are reviewing the policy and ""are mindful of the upcoming school year next month."" Texas education officials said last week they plan for schools to open, with opportunities for some virtual instruction and the expectation that closures could become necessary.

Americans are starting to capitalize on low prices at the gas pump as states loosen travel restrictions, a boon for the battered energy industry and a hopeful signal for the U.S. economic recovery.
With more states easing lockdown measures enacted to fight the spread of the coronavirus, people are gradually hitting the road and causing modest car traffic in cities from Miami to San Francisco. The slight increase in congestion comes with beaches and summer destinations opening and many people avoiding public transportation and airplanes.
That uptick in driving coincides with a nascent recovery in consumer spending, fueling hopes that the economy is rebounding from the worst of the virus-induced slowdown.
The optimism is driving a rally in investments from stocks to commodities. It powered the S&P 500 and oil prices last week to their highest level since early March. U.S. crude inched lower Monday while stocks added 0.4%, extending their rally.
Meanwhile, with more people driving, the national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline climbed in five consecutive weeks through Monday to $1.97 from a four-year low of $1.74 hit in late April, data from tracking firm GasBuddy show.
Prices are still well below where they started the year. But their rebound and the bounceback in oil prices represent an initial step for the energy sector's survival. Producers like Chevron Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. are slashing supply with crude still below levels that make most projects profitable. Some investors expect those production cuts and a continued rise in travel to buoy energy prices moving forward.
Matt Jackson has been driving more in Philadelphia since returning to work a few weeks ago. The 39-year-old judicial aide and paralegal student has been working alternate days and lives about 10 miles from the court building where he works. Mr. Jackson has noticed more traffic on highways lately and hopes to travel to New Jersey beaches this summer.
""Philadelphia is always a jumping place, and it's coming back,"" he said. ""As things begin to reopen, I do see more people."" Gas prices in the area have risen to about $2.20 a gallon from a recent low of $2.10. He said the low prices add incentive to take longer drives.
The energy crash battered refiners that turn crude into fuel products, with companies including Marathon Petroleum Corp., Valero Energy Corp. and Phillips 66 posting some of their worst earnings in years for the first quarter. Those companies typically do well when oil prices are low and people are taking advantage by driving more, but millions of people didn't drive for much of March and April due to lockdowns.
Demand for gas is slowly starting to creep back. Requests for driving directions on Apple Inc.'s Maps app are back around mid-January levels, while data from Dutch location technology firm TomTom International BV show traffic congestion gradually climbing in some large U.S. cities, though it is still down substantially from March levels in many.
""We're already seeing some improvement in demand, and this is going to continue as people return to more normal activities,"" Valero CEO Joe Gorder said on a call with investors and analysts in late April. Shares of Valero, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum have each rebounded 47% or more so far this quarter.
Still, refining activity in the U.S. remains well below normal levels, and many analysts expect a bumpy recovery until more of the population feels comfortable traveling long distances. The speed of recent price moves has made the current environment even more challenging for energy companies. One price of U.S. crude dropped below $0 a barrel for the first time ever on April 20, meaning holders of the futures were paying to get rid of them due to a lack of available storage. Oil prices have since rebounded to the mid-$30s a barrel but are still at levels that would leave much of the energy industry languishing.
If prices keep rising, some investors expect producers to lift supply in response, another factor that could slow the recovery.
""The first leg of a recovery from a really low point is the easiest part,"" said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management. ""There's still a lot of crude around."" She has been driving more recently and has noticed more cars on the road in Hoboken, N.J., but expects it to take time for demand to fully rebound.
The recent rise in fuel prices is also a reminder of the big disparities across states due to a combination of state and local taxes, refining costs and pricing by energy companies. Prices in California are at about $2.90 a gallon, while gas costs roughly $1.65 in Texas.
Bob Haines, a 59-year-old who runs a small auto-repair shop in Waukegan, Ill., often travels a few miles north to Wisconsin to fill up because gas is much cheaper there. Prices are at about $1.85 a gallon nearby in Wisconsin, 40 cents cheaper than where he lives.
While Mr. Haines and his family are still limiting their driving, he is noticing more activity in the area, particularly in Wisconsin, where the state's top court overturned the state's coronavirus shutdown order last month.
""People are flocking to the bars, they're flocking to the restaurants,"" he said. ""It appears we're getting into pre-Covid-19 traffic patterns again,"" he added, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Demand for ride-shares has risen recently in Fort Worth, Texas, as businesses in the area reopen, said Katrina Titze, a 34-year-old driver for Lyft Inc. and consultant.

Oil prices have since rebounded to the mid-$30s a barrel but are still at levels that would leave much of the energy industry languishing. If prices keep rising, some investors expect producers to lift supply in response, another factor that could slow the recovery.
""The first leg of a recovery from a really low point is the easiest part,"" said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Management. ""There's still a lot of crude around."" She has been driving more recently and has noticed more cars on the road in Hoboken, N.J., but expects it to take time for demand to fully rebound.
The recent rise in fuel prices is also a reminder of the
big disparities across states
due to a combination of state and local taxes, refining costs and pricing by energy companies. Prices in California are at about $2.90 a gallon, while gas costs roughly $1.65 in Texas.

Bob Haines, a 59-year-old who runs a small auto repair shop in Waukegan, Ill., often travels a few miles north to Wisconsin to fill up because gas is much cheaper there. Prices are currently at about $1.85 a gallon nearby in Wisconsin, 40 cents cheaper than where he lives.
While Mr. Haines and his family are still limiting their driving, he is noticing more activity in the area, particularly in Wisconsin, where the state's top court overturned the state's coronavirus shutdown order last month.
""People are flocking to the bars, they're flocking to the restaurants,"" he said. ""It appears we're getting into pre-Covid-19 traffic patterns again,"" he added, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Driving is rebounding as the economy reopens and Americans take to their cars, viewing them as being more protected spaces than airplanes, trains, or other mass transit.
That looks bullish for Marathon Petroleum (ticker: MPC) and other big refining stocks, such as Valero Energy (VLO) and Phillips 66 (PSX), that have bounced off their March lows, but are still down an average of 30% this year.
Marathon, whose shares trade around $35, is a play on rising gasoline demand. It is also a sum-of-the-parts story, with the No. 1 independent U.S. refiner by capacity planning to spin off its valuable Speedway division by year end.
Speedway is the No. 2 company-owned gasoline and convenience-store group in the country, behind only Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada (ATD.B.Canada). Thanks to high-margin impulse purchases by drivers, convenience stores command higher valuations than supermarket chains. Marathon could be worth more than $50 a share in a breakup.
Phillips 66 and Valero are favored by J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh. Valero is a well-managed pure-play refiner with a strong balance sheet. Phillips 66 is the industry leader with the safest dividend, and it offers a ""best in class alternative to the oil majors,"" Gresh recently wrote. Phillips 66 has refining, pipeline, chemical, and retail businesses—everything except energy production. Marathon yields 6.6%; Valero, 5.8%; and Phillips 66, 4.6%.
Gasoline demand was down around 40%, year over year, in April, but the comparison improved to an estimated 20% drop in May, according to Gresh.
Investors are focused on gasoline usage during the remainder of 2020. Mizuho analyst Paul Sankey has predicted ""record"" demand for the fuel this summer, as Americans vacation domestically, rather than taking trips abroad.
Gresh is not quite as optimistic, forecasting a 5% drop in demand in the third and fourth quarters. He wrote last week that he saw ""negative factors like the recession (unemployment) and telecommuting more than offsetting the positive factors like the shift from air/mass transit to vehicles and the possibility of more staycations this summer.""

Why This Small, Elite Cruise Operator Could Weather the Coronavirus Storm

Gasoline prices, now averaging about $2 a gallon for regular nationally, aren't expected to rise much this summer, based on futures quotes, even with a strong driving season.
The outlook for refining is admittedly not rosy at the moment. Jet fuel demand is weak, and utilization rates are historically low. The entire U.S. industry—with the exception of Phillips 66—is expected to lose money in 2020, but investors are looking out to 2021 and 2022, as they are with other hard-hit industries.
And Marathon may be the cheapest stock in the group.
At its current share price, investors are effectively paying little or nothing for the company's refining business when factoring in the potential $20 billion value of Speedway and the $13 billion market value of Marathon's majority stake in MPLX (MPLX), one of the country's largest pipeline operators.
The refining business could be worth $20 billion, given its capacity of three million barrels a day and normalized annual pretax cash flow of $4 billion. Strip out about $10 billion of net debt (excluding borrowing at MPLX) and certain costs, and Marathon would be worth approximately $55 a share.
Credit Suisse's Manav Gupta wrote this month that he is pleased that Michael Hennigan, who became Marathon's chief executive in March, is focused on ""strict cost control, capital discipline,"" and operational improvement. Hennigan's predecessor, Gary Heminger, was more of an empire builder.
The activist investor Elliott Management took aim at Marathon and Heminger last September, arguing that the stock, then around $55, was ""severely undervalued"" and worth at least $89 a share on a sum-of-the-parts basis.
Elliott's broadside came when the refining business was much stronger than it is now, but if the stock merely gets back to $55, it would be about a 55% gain.

Americans are starting to get back behind the wheel, welcome news for the companies that turn oil into gasoline and diesel.
Fuel makers including Valero Energy Corp. and Phillips 66 have said they expect gasoline demand to continue to rebound after plunging to roughly half of normal levels in early April, as states reopen from lockdowns imposed to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
As a result, some refiners are looking to produce more gasoline again after choking back output in recent weeks. Such a move should help keep prices at the pump low for longer. Regular gasoline averaged about $1.82 a gallon in the U.S. on Friday, down from $2.88 a year earlier, according to the price tracker GasBuddy.
""People have been cooped up, they want to drive,"" Phillips 66 Chief Executive Greg Garland told investors recently, offering a glimmer of hope as the largest U.S. refiners posted their worst quarterly earnings in years.
Marathon Petroleum Corp. reported a first-quarter loss of $9.2 billion, the company's largest quarterly loss on record, FactSet data show. The company took $12.4 billion in charges tied to items that include the value of its refineries, pipelines and inventory of oil and refined products.
Phillips 66's quarterly loss, at $2.5 billion, was its largest ever. The company attributed it in large part to impairments, lower refinery utilization and thinner margins. Valero reported a $1.9 billion quarterly loss, its biggest since 2008.
It wasn't that long ago that refiners were raking in money as soaring U.S. crude production created regional bottlenecks, allowing them to access pockets of relatively inexpensive oil.
Fuel makers typically do well when oil prices are low because people drive more. But the recent oil-price crash has largely been driven by a rapid decline in demand as people stay home and travel less to avoid contracting Covid-19. That means the second quarter is expected to be grim for refiners, too.
Nevertheless, fuel makers were generally optimistic about an eventual recovery in appetite for their products, saying they think gasoline consumption will continue to climb, even as people remain wary of getting on an airplane.
""We see a fairly gradual recovery in demand,"" Gary Simmons, Valero's chief commercial officer, told investors in late April.
Mr. Simmons said he expects gasoline demand to return eventually to around pre-Covid-19 levels, explaining that some people will embrace driving over public transportation because of concern about coronavirus transmission, offsetting those who continue to work from home.
Signs of a nascent demand recovery and global supply cuts are boosting oil prices. U.S. crude futures for delivery next month rose 5.1% to $24.74 a barrel on Friday, capping off a big weekly gain.
Gasoline futures, meanwhile, advanced 2.2% to 95.22 cents a gallon, also continuing a recent rebound.
Refiners sharply curtailed fuel making in March and April as businesses closed and airlines grounded planes, running their facilities at an average of about two-thirds capacity in mid-April, Energy Information Administration data show. That level is down from about 90% capacity a year earlier.
Companies adjusted their operations to minimize their output of jet fuel and gasoline in favor of diesel, which is used to power the trucks that remained on the road to transport food and other necessities.
But fuel makers have generated so much diesel that stockpiles are rising, federal data show. Gasoline reserves, while still quite high, are falling as demand inches back up. U.S. gas consumption in the week ended May 1 was up roughly a third from its low four weeks earlier, although still well below demand a year ago, according to the EIA.
""There's probably a few months before we can really give a better sense for exactly how this is going to play out, but we're definitely off the lows and seeing some nice improvement,"" Timothy Griffith, president of Marathon Petroleum's Speedway gas station chain, said recently. The Ohio-based refiner is responding by tweaking its systems to generate more gasoline and less diesel.
Average prices at the pump for regular gasoline in the U.S. fell as low as $1.74 a gallon in late April, their lowest level since February 2016, the depths of the last oil crash, GasBuddy data show.
Prices will likely only go up from here, but gasoline should remain cheap by historical standards for some time as Americans burn through the excess fuel that has built up in storage, said Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis. ""There's a very strong possibility that though prices have started to move up, we may be looking at an overall period of six to 12 months when prices remain somewhat depressed,"" Mr. De Haan said.

| Jump to first hitPhillips 66 has stalled Red Oak and Liberty pipeline projects The global oil and gas pipeline sector is facing several headwinds such as fall in the oil and gas prices, demand destruction and a weak global economic outlook. The pipeline operators are being forced to cut capex on upcoming projects, leading to projects getting delayed or stalled, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.Sujith Singh, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “Multiple pipeline operators are looking at project delays as a means to counter the impact of COVID-19. Phillips 66 has stalled Red Oak and Liberty pipeline projects, which were expected to start operations by 2021. Two of the projects of Pembina Pipeline Corp – Pembina Peace Expansion VIII and Pembina Peace Expansion IX, are likely to be pushed by a year due to falling oil prices and the pandemic outbreak.” Furthermore, some pipeline operators are likely to put off their investment decisions or reduce capex on projects. Phillips 66 is likely to defer its Final Investment Decision (FID) on the ACE pipeline project, which was expected to take place in 2020. Similarly, Sinopec has announced a 2.5 per cent reduction in capital expenditure for the year 2020, which has a considerable impact on its refining units and related facilities such as pipelines and storage facilities.Singh concludes: “The instances of Enlink Midstream laying off a fifth of its workforce, Energy Transfer Partners suspending most of its construction activities on the Mariner East Pipeline project and Plains All American selling its non-core assets indicate the deep crisis pipeline operators are up against.” -- Tradearabia News ServiceCopyright 2020 Al Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

It's a great honor to be with the world leaders in American oil and gas and, really, I could say, the world leaders, period, when it comes to energy and American energy. The biggest companies anywhere - anywhere in the world.I want to thank Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt; Secretary of Energy, Dan Brouillette; and Ambassador Robert Lighthizer for being here.We're also joined by Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senators John Cornyn, Kevin Cramer, Ted Cruz, and Dan Sullivan. Thank you. These are people that really want to see good energy at the good price.With us as well are Greg Garland of Phillips 66, Dave Hager of Devon Energy, Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, Jeff Hildebrand of Hilcorp Energy, Vicki Hollub of Occidental Petroleum, Mike Sommers of the American Petroleum Institute, Kelcy Warren of Energy Transfer Partners, Mike Wirth of Chevron, and Darren Woods of an extremely small company known as Exxon Mobil. Well, it's smaller today than it was four weeks ago - (laughter) - by about half, right? That's all right. It'll be better than ever.Today we'll discuss the impact of the coronavirus on American energy industry. As the pandemic brought on by global economy - I mean, it's an incredible thing that's happened. Nobody thought this was possible. We had the greatest economy in the world. Probably, you were doing - all of you - the best ever. Everybody was doing the best ever. And then, all of a sudden, they said, You have to shut down the country, and they have to shut down the world, because the whole world is shut down, not the country. The whole world is shut down: 151 countries. Probably, it's higher than that now. That was as of a week ago.So the entire world is shut down, trying to get rid of this scourge. And - and we'll do it.I thought what I might do is go around the room and you just introduce yourselves to the media real quickly, and then we'll have a discussion afterwards. You know, our 2.2-trillion-dollar relief package includes provisions to allow businesses to deduct their losses this year against taxes they paid in previous years, which gets you a lot of liquidity. And a lot of companies need the liquidity right now.And hopefully we're going to be back in business very soon. We're going to be open very soon. This country wasn't built to be closed. And, essentially, we have a closed country. Nobody has ever heard of a thing like this.But this was - I was with some of the leading professionals, and they say not since 1917 has there been anything like this. 1917 was a time when, I guess, you could say, 50, 75, or 100 million - you hear different estimates - people died. Think of that: 100 million. Maybe 100 million people died. So they had no communications. They weren't able to shut things down like we are doing.But that was a - that was a plague. That was a plague. It started here, actually. It went to Europe. We were badly affected, but Europe was really affected. So that was the worst.So not since 100 years ago - more than 100 years ago has this - a thing like this happened.I just want to start by saying it's an honor to be with you. I know most of you, one way or the other. Some of you I know, and - but I know all of you by seeing you on the covers of all the business magazines and the magazines. And you've done a great job, and we'll work this out and we'll get our energy business back. I'm with you 1,000 percent. It's a great business. It's a very vital business. And, honestly, you've been very fair. You've kept energy prices reasonable for a long period of time. We've got a long period of time with very reasonable energy prices.So I want to thank you all for being here. And maybe we'll start with Mike. Please.MR. WIRTH: All right. Mike Wirth with Chevron Corporation, Mr. President. I'm proud of the work our people are doing to support healthcare providers, first responders, and all the other vital industries that keep our economy going.Thank you for having us.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike, very much.

GARLAND: Mr. President, I'm Greg Garland, Phillips 66. Again, thank you for your great leadership through this pandemic crisis and all that you've done on the stimulus package, really, for the American economy. I'm proud of our employees. They're working to provide energy and improve lives.THE PRESIDENT: We think it's going to come back quickly. It's - it's ready. We're ready. And we've got the right packages out there. So -MR. GARLAND: We need it, too.THE PRESIDENT: Very good. We're looking at a - I think we're going to be really looking very seriously at a infrastructure package where - it's so important for our country.You know, as of this moment, Darren, we have $7 trillion-plus in the Middle East. For what? For what reason? And we don't put money in our own country. So we're going to do a big - a big package on infrastructure fairly soon, I think, and that's very important. And it's great for you, great for everybody.Darren, please.MR. WOODS: Thank you, Mr. President. Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil Corporation. I'd like to add my thanks for your leadership in this space, as well, and say I think all of our companies here align with your objective, which is to get the economy moving and to make people's lives around the world better.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Great job you've done. Thank you.MR. HAMM: Harold Hamm, chairman of Continental Resources, also out of Oklahoma City. Thanks for having this meeting. I think this is so timely and necessary. Really appreciate your leadership, also the friendship that you've kept with the Saudis - the Saudi Crown minister - or Crown Prince, and also Vladimir Putin. I know those haven't been easy sometimes, but at this time, it was particularly needed.So I represent our company, as well as DEPA - Domestic Energy Producers Alliance. And we're about 10,000 companies and individuals - mostly independent producers.THE PRESIDENT: That's great. Great job you're doing.I think President Putin and the Crown Prince want something to happen badly. Certainly terrible for them, what's happening, too. So they want to see something happen.

Our distinction is we are the only private company here. This is a company that's based in Houston, domestic-only exploration and production company.And I'm really here today to represent the independent energy companies, the family-owned businesses that are in this industry, and to give you, really, that perspective and add to the conversation in that regard.THE PRESIDENT: Good.

Great job you're doing, too.He's not an oil and gas man. He's a wonderful person and a wonderful politician and he wants to see the industry get strong again. So, Kevin, do you have anything to say, by the way?LEADER MCCARTHY: Well, first, I want to thank you for doing this. Just by you reaching out to President Putin and the Crown Prince, things have improved. You're looking around at a lot of jobs, but what else you're not seeing at this table: A lot of these are small businesses that work with all these individuals around here. And your action today, with signing the CARES Act, getting the small-business loans out, is going very strongly -THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.LEADER MCCARTHY: - because it's needed.THE PRESIDENT: It's doing well.LEADER MCCARTHY: But the American economy - the greatest strength is our - what energy provides us. You provide us at a good price. These are great jobs. But more importantly, it also gives us energy independence. It changes the whole dynamics around the world.And so I thank you for the leadership and what you're doing.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Kevin. And as you just said, the Bank of America, in particular, has really - of the big banks - has really stepped into it. They have done a fantastic job. Today, it's over -LEADER MCCARTHY: Ten thousand in the first two hours.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. Bank of America has been unbelievable. And I want to thank them. I want to thank all of the community banks and the smaller banks that have been loaning a lot of money - paycheck. It's all about the paycheck. And that - nobody would have believed it could have gone so well.So it's - it's just a number of hours. But the numbers are far greater than we would have anticipated. So it's been really great.And thank you to all the banks, but again, in particular, Bank of America. They really stepped right up and they did it. There were no big deals. They weren't making a big deal out of anything. So that was terrific.And I think what we want to do - John Cornyn, please. I know how you are so involved in this, coming from the great state of Texas. Would you like to say a couple of words, John?SENATOR CORNYN: Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for convening the meeting. Many of us have been talking together, but we can't get done what needs to be done. Only you and the administration can. And particularly, getting the attention of the Saudis and flooding the markets, really adding insult to injury in a time when on our economy was suffering anyway because of the coronavirus. And so this meeting could not be more timely.I agree with what's been said about the importance of affordable energy to our standard of living. And, really, we've changed the - changed the world as a result of the production of domestic energy here, and improved the quality of life for a lot of people.THE PRESIDENT: Thanks very much, John. Really good job. And John agrees - we were talking about it the other day - that you've all done well, but you've also kept energy very affordable, really. Very, very affordable and very - a lot of it. We never had any problems. And we're going to keep it that way.Do I see Dan back there? Dan?SENATOR SULLIVAN: Yes, sir, Mr. President. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: I was looking - I thought that looked like Dan.SENATOR SULLIVAN: I want to thank you for convening this meeting. You know, under the Trump administration, working with the Congress, the U.S. has become the world's energy superpower again. It's unbelievable. And these companies have done it. Obviously it's a very important issue in my state, the great state of Alaska. But these are great jobs, as John Cornyn just said, for all of our states. But it's really important for the national security of our country too.And we have been - a number of senators have been reaching out, having frank discussions with the Saudis, saying, Hey, if you're a longstanding ally of ours, we're not - right now, you're hurting a lot of our citizens. You're hurting a lot of the people we represent and shouldn't take us for granted.We have a great military that's protected Saudi Arabia for decades. And Senator Cramer and I have some legislation that could possibly change that if they don't start cooperating.So again, we appreciate your leadership with the Crown Prince, with the Russians, in calling this meeting.But this is a great sector of the U.S. economy that, once we get through this, and we will - of this pandemic, this -this sector is going to take off again. And your - your administration and you have had a lot to do with the strength of the U.S. energy sector. And we need to keep it strong.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Dan.And Kevin Cramer, North Dakota. People don't realize how big a producer North Dakota is. Right?SENATOR CRAMER: Well, Harold knows. (Laughter.)SENATOR CORNYN: Harold knows.SENATOR CRAMER: It sort of allows the others (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT: Harold - Harold knows, that's for sure.SENATOR CRAMER: Mr. President, to echo everything and maybe add a little bit: The people around your Cabinet table right now are part of the renaissance of oil and gas in this country. But since you became President, we went from a renaissance to security, to independence, to dominance. And that dominance and that security are - right now are in some danger.Just a quick example: In North Dakota, since Saudi Arabia and Russia announced their little price war, we've had $6 billion of cutbacks taken out of our state, planned for this year.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.SENATOR CRAMER: I was economic development director when the entire gross domestic product of North Dakota was $13 billion. So that's significant. That represents not just capex; that represents lots of jobs, lots of people in the value chain.And I would just add one word to what Dan talked about with regard to Saudi Arabia. It is estimated by one report in 2018 that we spent a minimum of $81 billion defending global oil supplies. We can use that money in national defense and other hotspots in the world, if our friends are going to treat us this way.So I appreciate your outreach this week. I think we're halfway there just with the success of your diplomacy this week. Thank you for this meeting.THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's gone up. It's gone up. And we have to. Otherwise, we do - we lose a lot of jobs too. We're talking about one of the big job producers anywhere, Kevin, right?Would you have anything to say?MR. SOMMERS: Mr. President, thank you. I'm Mike Sommers. I'm President and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute. The folks around this table represent the American energy revolution, and we want to thank you for everything that you've done to support that revolution. And we want to make sure that revolution continues -THE PRESIDENT: Right.MR. SOMMERS: - after this pandemic crisis is solved.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike.MR. SOMMERS: Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Very good.LEADER MCCARTHY: I think Senator Cruz was somewhere -THE PRESIDENT: I think he's around here.LEADER MCCARTHY: Right back there. Ted can't be seen.THE PRESIDENT: Where - where is Senator Cruz?PARTICIPANT: He's hiding behind the press. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: I can't believe it. He's gone - he's gone over to the evil side. (Laughter.) That's terrible.Cruz, what are you doing there?SENATOR CRUZ: Mr. President, thank you for convening this meeting. This is an important meeting and this is the time, as you know, of crisis all across the country - a public health crisis and an economic crisis.As you've heard, and as you know, from everyone around this table, the energy sector has been a huge part of the economic success and boom that we've enjoyed over the last several years. And the combination of the economic harm of the coronavirus crisis, combined with the Saudis and Russians waging economic warfare on jobs in this country, it's been a perfect storm in the energy sector.And I'll tell you, there are a lot of jobs - there are millions of jobs in Texas and across the country that are represented by the men and women around this table and by energy producers. And there are small producers throughout Texas and throughout the country who are - who are on the verge of being driven out of business.And so this - this meeting, I think, is important. Every one of the senators in this room has had multiple conversations with the Saudis, leaning in hard on the Saudis. And your leadership and diplomacy with the Crown Prince had a big impact getting them to stop flooding the market and taking advantage of this crisis.And I would underscore one other issue that a number of the folks around this table have raised and I'm very concerned about: is ensuring that those in energy in this time of crisis have access to capital. That - there are jobs that are hanging in the balance. And if the energy producers in this country that have made America the number one producer of oil and gas in the world can't access capital to get out of this crisis, we're going to see bankruptcies at a level this country hasn't seen in decades.And so this meeting and the continued leadership of your administration is hugely important. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you very much, Ted. And while you're up, the concept, and, for instance - I think we should say it in front of the media - but oil reserves, storing oil. We're filling up the national reserves, as you know. We're getting the oil at a great price.But at these prices - in fact, Kevin and I have been speaking about it; John and I have been speaking about it - at these prices, you would think you'd want to fill up every cavity that we have in this country. And there's some areas in Louisiana and other areas that could be filled up; they hold a lot of oil.But at these prices - and it would be good and it would keep everybody working - but you would think you'd want to fill up those areas. What do you think of that, Ted?SENATOR CRUZ: Look, I think that's exactly right. I think it makes sense in terms of easing the pressure that is threatening these jobs. But it also makes sense for the taxpayer.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.SENATOR CRUZ: That Strategic Petroleum Reserve is there in times of crisis. And usually the way the federal government works is we buy when it's expensive, and we sell when it's cheap.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah. No, it's -SENATOR CRUZ: We actually have an opportunity now to buy when it's cheap. I think it was inexcusable that Democratic leadership in the House and Senate blocked that in this bill we passed last week. And then I think Congress needs to go back and address it.LEADER MCCARTHY: It was in the bill.SENATOR CRUZ: Yep.LEADER MCCARTHY: And then the Speaker came in and that's the one thing - when she held this bill up for the number of days - that she removed.THE PRESIDENT: Twenty-dollar oil. Think of it.LEADER MCCARTHY: Yeah.THE PRESIDENT: Twenty dollars.SENATOR CRUZ: Well, and there are too many Democrats -THE PRESIDENT: It's politics.SENATOR CRUZ: - that want to see these -THE PRESIDENT: It's all right.SENATOR CRUZ: - jobs go away.THE PRESIDENT: I think you should go back though, Kevin. I think you should go back and see, John, if you guys can go back and do a separate bill.And beyond that, you know, I think it's 75 million barrels right now to fill it up. That's not that much. So it's fairly in pretty good shape. But we have other areas that are bigger, frankly, that we can fill up too.But at those prices, we should be - we should be pumping it out. So maybe you guys can check on it and see what you can do about it. I don't think anyone can reject it. Nobody can reject it. Ted, you'll work on that?SENATOR CRUZ: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: Anybody else? David, you guys okay? David, you want to say something?SECRETARY BERNHARDT: So just one thing, Mr. President. The Department of the Interior manages a large portion of land and part of the offshore. And one of the things we have done over the last 15 days as you had the slow the spread, we have really had our inspectors out on the frontlines working to make sure that the production that's taking place is occurring in a safe and a responsible manner, and I thank everybody for their cooperation in that.These jobs are so important to the American people, and it's important that we make sure that we dot our I's and cross our T's too.THE PRESIDENT: He's the biggest landlord in the country. (Laughter.) Meaning, it's called Interior. Interior is a lot of land, when you look at it. Thank you. Great job you're doing.So, Dan, go ahead.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Mr. President, thank you. Thank you, sir, for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dan.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: My name is Dan Brouillette. I serve the President as the Secretary of Energy. With regard to the storage, Mr. President, I'm happy to announce we went to market this week for 30 million barrels. Notwithstanding the - the desire of the Congress not to give us new money to pursue this idea, we have found an alternative financing mechanism -THE PRESIDENT: Good.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: - so that we can immediately find -THE PRESIDENT: I figured you would. (Laughter.) I actually wasn't worried about it. (Laughter.)SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: - so that can we can find -THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying per barrel?SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: I'm sorry, sir?THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying? (Laughs.) He didn't want to answer.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: It's going to be a little a low. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: What are you paying per barrel? A flexible price or would it -SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: They may be paying us. This could be a little low.THE PRESIDENT: So we're going to go negative, like interests rates. Negative.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: But, Mr. President, I just wanted you to know - and for the industry players who are here: We are moving very aggressively. We're using every tool that we have at the U.S. Department of Energy, not only to provide immediate relief for this particular industry and the economy itself, but also to look for technologies that over time will reduce the cost structure for the entire industry.So we're moving as aggressively as we can, sir. Thank you for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Dan, check out other areas where you can store oil.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: And there are some very big ones, bigger than what we have now. And at these prices, you should do it.SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Refill it up, right?SECRETARY BROUILLETTE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Fill up the tank.Okay, Bob Lighthizer, you've been so great. And this isn't your meeting really, but Bob has done some of the best trade deals ever done in our country. And one of them has kicked - it actually kicked in on April 1st, and that's with China. And I hope they're buying a lot. I hope.AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: I don't (inaudible) say anything.THE PRESIDENT: Want to say something?AMBASSADOR LIGHTHIZER: I'm here to answer questions, Mr. President, so I'll just - I'll just keep my mouth shut. But the trade deals are working. China is good. We're on - we're on track with USMCA. But I'll just answer questions.THE PRESIDENT: He's very shy. That's good. He just wants to make deals. That's all. And you've done a great job. Thank you very much.We will have a news conference at about 5 o'clock, 5:15 maybe. And so we'll see you in a little while. We'll answer questions.But this is a great group of leaders, and we've got to make sure that we preserve and even make greater our energy industry. And I want to thank all of the senators and congressmen, the boss here, for being here and for working so hard. They are - I'll tell you what: They are calling me constantly. They want your industry to be successful and they really - and they're going to make it that way. We're all going to make it that way.So I'll see you at 5 o'clock and - same place. We look forward to it. Thank you. Thank you very much.Q One question about testing. Was anybody in here tested for coronavirus? We got the new guidance?THE PRESIDENT: Well, would anybody like to be tested? How about you? You want to be tested?Q I would love to be tested, actually.THE PRESIDENT: Huh?Q I think all of us would.THE PRESIDENT: We might - we might be able to do that. You know, it's a great question. No, you know what? I like it. Let's test these guys. You know, they gave us millions of jobs. Listen, they gave us millions of jobs. If anybody wants to be tested, we'll test you. I want to test the head of Exxon.Q Will this be for every meeting?THE PRESIDENT: No. Not for every meeting.END 3:41 P.M. EDT(The White House, the United States)"

Gasoline cost only $1.31 a gallon Sunday at Bill Douglass's convenience stores north of Dallas, the lowest price he can recall in more than two decades. Yet sales were down roughly 50% in some stores.
""It's dropped so much that I'm bewildered,"" Mr. Douglass, founder of fuel company Douglass Distributing Co., said of retail prices. ""We're under siege.""
Lower prices at the pump typically encourage people to log more miles. Not this time. Fuel demand is plummeting as millions hunker down to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.
In the U.S., gasoline has actually been worth less than crude in recent days, even with U.S. benchmark oil fetching around $22 a barrel. The pressure on profits increases the likelihood that refineries will need to shutter in coming weeks to balance supply and demand.
""We're nearing kind of minimum crude rates in many of our refineries today,"" Robert Herman, head of refining at Phillips 66, told investors last week.
Phillips 66, the largest U.S. refiner by market capitalization, said it would slash this year's capital spending by $700 million, to $3.1 billion, after it saw domestic demand for gasoline fall about 20% in just a week, and as much as 30% in some regions.
That drop is likely only the beginning. Analytics firm IHS Markit says daily gasoline demand in the U.S. could be less than half of normal levels over the next four to six weeks, as people isolate themselves.
Pre-virus, Phillips 66 and other fuel makers were the stock stars of the American oil patch. An index composed of five of the largest independent U.S. refiners increased about 56% in the five years ended in 2019, roughly tracking the S&P 500 index, S&P Global Market Intelligence data show. But that refining index has plunged as the coronavirus has taken hold in the U.S., declining by about 56% in 2020 as of Friday, compared with a slide of about 21% in the S&P 500.
Meanwhile, margins for producing gasoline have eroded. On the Gulf Coast, the fuel sold for as little as about $16 a barrel last week, more than $4 below the U.S. benchmark oil price at the time, S&P Global Platts data show. That means a barrel of crude cost more than the processed product fetched.
While margins for diesel have held up better thanks to trucking and other commercial activity, those for jet fuel have shrunk as airlines have grounded planes.
Should those dynamics persist, some expect refineries to delay resuming operations after periods of maintenance or even power down in the coming weeks.
""There's not a lot you can do if nobody wants your products,"" said Amy Kalt, a consultant for Baker & O'Brien Inc., an energy consulting firm. She said the duration of the shutdowns would depend on how long people continue to isolate themselves and how much of a gasoline inventory builds up during that time.
American drivers already were using less gasoline pre-coronavirus due in large part to more efficient vehicles, and some industry executives have said fuel-making wouldn't be an area of growth.
U.S. gasoline demand fell about 0.6% last year even as drivers logged more miles, federal data show.
The domestic response to the coronavirus is still in its early days, but some think gasoline consumption may never fully rebound.
""I think we will have a permanent and long-term reduction in travel patterns,"" said Ramin Shabanpour, an assistant professor of engineering at the University of Illinois at Chicago who has written on telecommuting and its impact on transportation. ""We are learning right now how we can do our daily activities -- running our work meetings, attending our classes -- online instead of spending our time traveling.""

That isn't stopping privately held Meridian Energy Group Inc. from pursuing plans to build refineries in North Dakota and West Texas, betting that proximity to the shale oil produced in those regions will give the company an edge. Slated to open in 2023, the North Dakota facility would be the nation's first new refinery in decades.

""The demand may pick up less vigorously when we're past Covid-19, but they will respond to these price signals, and they will get back in their cars and go places,"" said Bill Prentice, chief executive of Meridian Energy.
After the owner lowered prices to just 99 cents a gallon for regular unleaded, cars were lined up last week to fill up at Patriot Express Mart in Paris, Tenn.
""It's a little crazy,"" said Josie Taylor, manager of the service station. The big draw might be the Krispy Krunchy Chicken. ""We have 50-cent wings also."" She said workers are wearing plastic gloves and are wiping down the pumps every 30 minutes.
Earlier in the month, Mr. Douglass's stores in Texas were busy, too. But the initial rush of people hoarding gasoline has all but disappeared. He recently had to lay off employees for the first time in the 39-year history of Douglass Distributing, which sells wholesale fuel and operates dozens of Lone Star Food Store convenience shops.
Demand for premium gasoline has fallen off so much that the company has begun redistributing the fuel from lower-volume stores to those that see more traffic and have a better chance of selling it.
""Nobody is spending 10 more cents than they have to spend,"" Mr. Douglass said.

Oil-refiner stocks
jumped on Thursday
and they could continue their run, one analyst wrote in a note upgrading several stocks.
The refiners will undoubtedly be hurt as fewer people use gasoline and other products made from crude oil amid the coronavirus shutdown. Several have already had to cut the amount of crude they are processing. But the stocks have arguably already taken all of that into account and then some, argues Jefferies analyst Chritopher Sighinolfi.
Even though Covid-19 will have ""a severe impact on 2020 refined product demand, resulting in acute financial pressure in the second and third quarter, we see the virus's passing, low interest rates, fiscal stimulus, low energy prices, and globally destocked supply chains fueling a return to more normal conditions in 2021,"" Sighinolfi writes.
The stocks jumped after the Senate passed a stimulus bill that will put more money into the hands of millions of Americans. While crude oil ended the day down more than 7%, gasoline prices were down 0.6%. If product demand improves and crude prices stay low, refiners can make money off the spread between crude and petroleum products. Valero (VLO), one of the largest independent refiners in the U.S., rose 15% on the day.
Refiners were in a relatively strong financial position going into this crisis. The industry has changed considerably since the last major economic shock. Some refiners, including Phillips 66 (PSX), have spun off from large integrated companies. Others have also added pipeline businesses that help stabilize their operations.
Just as important, they have become more conservative with their balance sheets and ""are sitting on meaningful cash positions and largely undrawn and substantial liquidity facilities,"" Sighinolfi writes.
Based on analysts' 2021 estimates, almost all the refiners are trading below 10 times earnings, with some trading below 6 times.
Sighiolfi upgraded five stocks to Buy from Hold. They included HollyFrontier (HFC), Holly Energy Partners (HEP), Phillips 66 Partners (PSXP), Phillips 66 and Valero.

The list includes international companies such as Exxon Mobil and Oklahoma City-based companies including Continental Resources and Devon Energy.Laredo said it expects to generate $90 million in free cash flow, excluding non-budgeted acquisitions for 2020.""Fueled by an extremely strong hedge position, Laredo has the flexibility to substantially reduce activity to preserve the value of our assets until commodity prices normalize,"" said Jason Pigott, president and CEO. ""We are moving quickly to stop most of our drilling and completions operations for the remainder of 2020. Our long-standing strategy of maximizing flexibility by limiting long-term service contracts, maintaining a strong hedge position and prioritizing a solid balance sheet with no near-term debt maturities enables us to scale back operations and preserve the financial strength to weather a decline in oil prices.""Laredo said 100% of anticipated 2020 oil production is hedged, with 7.2 million barrels swapped at $59.50 West Texas Intermediate and 2.4 million barrels swapped at $63.07 Brent.The company plans to suspend completion operations in the first week of May for the remainder of 2020 and reduce the operated rig count from four rigs to one rig by June and then run one rig for the balance of 2020.Laredo said it expects oil production for 2020 to decline 8% from 2019.Phillips 66 said its actions were in response to the challenging business environment.“Phillips 66 is well-positioned to manage through the challenging environment with our high-quality, diversified asset base and strong balance sheet,” said Greg Garland, chairman and CEO of Phillips 66. “Our top priorities remain the well-being of our employees, our communities, and safe and reliable operations. We are taking action to maintain our financial strength to ensure security of our dividend, execute capital growth projects that are near completion, and maintain our strong investment grade credit rating. We remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and creating long-term value for our shareholders.”Phillips 66 said the adjusted $3 billion in capital spending will be partially offset by a $400 million reduction in cash capital contributions anticipated from DCP Midstream.In midstream, the Red Oak Pipeline and Sweeny Frac 4 projects, as well as Phillips 66 Partners’ Liberty Pipeline, will all be deferred.The $2.5 billion Red Oak Pipeline LLC, a joint venture of Phillips 66 and Plains All American Pipeline, was announced in July to transport oil from Cushing and the Permian Basin to Corpus Christi, Ingleside, Houston and Beaumont, Texas.The $1.6 billion Liberty Pipeline, also announced in July, is a Phillips 66 joint venture with Bridger Pipeline LLC. It will transport oil from areas in the Rockies and Bakken to Cushing, and from Cushing to Corpus Christi, Ingleside and Houston.Phillips 66 Partners has also postponed its final investment decision on ACE Pipeline. Phillips 66 does not expect DCP Midstream to exercise its option to participate in Sweeny Fracs 2 and 3 in 2020.In refining, the company is deferring and cancelling certain discretionary projects. Phillips 66 also plans to reduce operating and administrative costs by $500 million in 2020.The company also temporarily suspended share repurchases. Share repurchases during the first quarter totaled $440 million. Phillips 66 will evaluate timing to resume share repurchases.Phillips also said it has secured a new $1 billion, 364-day term loan facility to provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility. It is in addition to the existing $5 billion revolving credit facility. Phillips 66 Partners has a $750 million revolving credit facility.“We will continue to closely monitor market conditions and evaluate the impact on our portfolio,” Garland said. “We are prepared to take additional action as needed. During these times of uncertainty, the people of Phillips 66 remain fully committed to providing energy and improving lives,” said Garland.

| Jump to first hitA Chinese national who admitted stealing trade secrets from a U.S. petroleum company has been sentenced to two years in federal prison. Hongjin Tan, 36, pleaded guilty in November of theft of a trade secret in connection with his work as a scientist at a Phillips 66 research facility in Bartlesville, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Tulsa. Prosecutors said Tan used a thumb drive to copy hundreds of files containing information about ``next generation battery technologies'' for use in the energy industry. Tan was sentenced Thursday in Tulsa and was also ordered to pay $150,000 in restitution. In his plea deal, Tan admitted copying and downloading the information without authorization. Prosecutors said Tan quit his job the day after downloading the information and told Phillips 66 he planned to return to China. Assistant U.S. Attorney Joel-Lyn McCormick said that prosecutors were unable to determine whether a third party or the Chinese government benefited from the information, the Tulsa World reported. In court filings, Tan's attorney noted he had no prior convictions and that Tan had ``longtime and substantial ties to the academic community.'' ``This is a serious offense, and Mr. Tan acknowledges that and accepts responsibility for his role in it,'' his attorney, Ryan Ray, wrote in a sentencing memorandum. - VOA"

A Chinese national was sentenced to two years in prison for allegedly stealing proprietary information worth about $1 billion from his Oklahoma employer, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday.
Hongjin Tan, 36 years old, is a Chinese citizen and U.S. legal permanent resident. He pleaded guilty in federal court in Oklahoma in November to charges including theft, unauthorized transmission and unauthorized possession of a trade secret.
Mr. Tan, who was arrested in December 2018, stole the information from a petroleum company in Oklahoma, prosecutors said.
A lawyer representing Mr. Tan didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Justice Department didn't identify Mr. Tan's U.S. employer. A LinkedIn profile for a Hongjin Tan listed experience as a staff scientist at Phillips 66 in Bartlesville, Okla., starting in May 2017.
A representative for Phillips 66 declined to comment, citing company practice to not comment on legal matters.
Mr. Tan used a personal thumb drive to copy hundreds of files, including information that the company considers to be trade secrets and that was outside of his area of responsibility, prosecutors said. He also downloaded files onto an external hard drive that was later found at his home, according to prosecutors.
On Dec. 12, 2018, the day after copying the files, he turned in his resignation from the company. He told his supervisor he was returning to China to care for his aging parents and didn't have a job offer, but was negotiating with a few battery companies in China, prosecutors said.
A hiring agreement written in Chinese from another organization was later found on Mr. Tan's work laptop, prosecutors said. The letter, dated Oct. 15, 2018, offered him a director position in Xiamen, China, according to the complaint.
A federal judge in Oklahoma also ordered Mr. Tan to pay $150,000 in restitution to his former employer.

| Jump to first hitOKLAHOMA CITY The fight continues against a Washington state law increasing restrictions on the unloading of crude oil shipped by rail through the state.Enacted in July, the crude-by-rail law requires oil to have a vapor pressure of less than 9pounds per square inchto be unloaded from rail car tanks in Washington state. Continental Resources, Phillips 66, Marathon Oil and other companies have joined Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter and others in opposition of the law, saying it will increase shipping times, increase pump prices and ban crude oil supplies from energy-producing states like Oklahoma, North Dakota and Montana.The new Washington state standard stems from deadly derailments in recent years.Washington officials believe by removing the gases in each rail car, it would reduce the risk of derailment and explosions.North Dakota and Montana petitioned the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to block the law. The administration had the petition open for public comment in September and received 4,329 comments.Among them was a letter penned by Jeff Hume, Continental vice chairman of strategic growth initiatives, supporting the petition and calling Washington’s restriction “unwarranted and arbitrary.”Hume wrote that producers active in the Bakken Shale region, like Continental, willexperience significant negative impacts by the restrictions. Crude oil transporters will have to use other modes of transport or reroute shipments, he wrote.“The facilities and infrastructure necessary to properly pretreat crude oil to achieve compliance with the Washington law do not exist at this time. Building these facilities would unnecessarily expand the environmental footprint of current oil and gas operations. Furthermore, the process necessary to properly pretreat the crude oil to meet the State of Washington's arbitrary, non-scientific standards is likely cost prohibitive,” Humes wrote.Hunter submitted a letter, signed by attorneys general from nine other states, opposing the law for violating federal laws and placing a burden on energy-producing states like Oklahoma.“By creating a new classification for crude oil below a certain vapor pressure, this law gradually implements a ban on facilities in the state that load or unload the oil and creates an economic burden on companies,” Hunter said in the letter.The Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma supports Hunter’s pushback, as the law is unconstitutional and will have “adverse effects on every energy-producing state,” said Jon Bargas, the Alliance’s senior vice president of public and government affairs.""This law is nothing more than an attempt by the environmentalist lobby to hinder domestic energy production by prohibiting American companies from getting their product to market,” Bargas said.The administration is waiting until the end of the rebuttal comment period Oct. 23 to make a determination.Companies have reported negative impacts of the law as well, with Phillips 66 writing to DOT it “drastically reduced” crude deliveries to its Ferndale Refinery. Marathon Petroleum reported the value of its crude rail offload facility at the Anacortes refinery could be severely limited.BP wrote that the law prevents its Cherry Point Refinery from receiving and unloading crude under a permit issued by the Northwest Clean Air Agency in 2013.Washington Assistant Attorney General Julian Beattie wrote in letter submitted to PHMSA that the pressure limit will improve public safety and North Dakota and Montana do not have grounds to challenge the law.Upholding North Dakota’s vapor pressure limit of 13.7 psi and not Washington’s would “draw an arbitrary line” and place Washington communities at risk, Beattie wrote.“PHMSA’s mission is to protect people and the environment, not to reward North Dakota for winning a regulatory ‘race to the bottom,’” Beattie wrote.

Although energy stocks as a group have been lagging behind the broader market, oil refiners have outperformed the sector in recent weeks. One analyst says that could continue, given tailwinds from
new shipping-fuel regulations
and other factors.
Refiners are down 2% in the past three months, while the energy sector overall, as tracked by the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund (XLE), is down 9%. Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta thinks investors should consider buying Marathon Petroleum (ticker: MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Valero Energy (VLO).
For one thing, refiners tend to do well at the end and the beginning of the year, with a positive average performance in five of the six months between October and March in the past 15 years. Mehta expects new U.N. regulations known as IMO 2020 that lower the maximum sulfur content of shipping fuel to 0.5% from 3.5% will boost refiners as well. The rules go into effect on Jan. 1.
U.S. refiners should benefit as ship operators switch from bunker fuel to lower-sulfur alternatives, he argues. Already, so-called crack spreads—the differential between the cost of crude oil and the price of the products that can be produced from it—are widening. Moves in the futures market point to favorable pricing in coming months.
Mehta thinks that each company also has ancillary businesses that could help its earnings. Marathon—his favorite stock in the group—owns a chain of gas stations that should ""perform well in a long-term $60 per barrel Brent crude price environment,"" he says. Brent crude, the main price benchmark for oil traded internationally, was trading at $59.60 a barrel on Friday morning.
Marathon shares could rise to $72 in the next six months, Mehta says, a 16% increase over Thursday's closing price of $61.93. Marathon's dividend yield is 3.4%.
Phillips 66 has a pipeline business that is similarly promising, Mehta writes. His price target on the stock is $112, a 5.1% premium over Thursday's closing price of $106.60. Phillips' dividend yield is 3.4%.
Valero should also benefit from IMO 2020, and has a side business that converts things like animal fat and used cooking oil into diesel fuel. Mehta's price target on the stock is $92, or a 7.2% premium to Thursday's closing price of $85.80. Valero has a dividend yield of 4.2%.

While many millennials are known as ""job-hoppers,"" some CEOs of today's biggest companies started at the bottom and became top execs at the same company.
Some started in distribution centers, while others started their careers on the assembly line. After decades of career moves and changing titles, these people were named CEOs at the company they started at decades before.
From Wal-Mart to Fidelity, these are the CEOs who started at the bottom and worked their way to the top.
Mary T. Barra started on the assembly line at General Motors. Now, she's the CEO and chairman of the auto company.

| Jump to first hitChevron Phillips Chemical Co. potential stake in Calgary-based Nova Chemicals could signal the return of oil majors in Alberta's energy sector, according to analysts.
Reuters reported Thursday that a joint venture between Chevron Corp. and Phillips 66 Co. made a US$15-billion bid to acquire Nova Chemicals, quoting people familiar with the matter.
""Nova's been spending a lot of money lately, but none of it in Canada other than the Sarnia plant so it might mean we've seen the multinationals exit Alberta on the oilsand side,"" said Bill Rawlusyk, executive director of natural gas liquids at IHS Inc. ""It means a multinational with big pockets coming back to Alberta, which would be a good thing in my opinion.""
Nova is run by the UAE stateowned Mubadala Investment Co., while Chevron Phillips is headquartered in Texas with 31 facilities in the U.S., Singapore, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
Chevron has off-loaded some of its Canadian assets, including the 57,000-bpd Burnaby refinery in British Columbia, to Parkland Fuel Corporation in 2017. It maintains a 20-per-cent interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, operated by Canadian Natural Resources, and a 60-per-cent operated interest in its Ells River heavy oil leases, and is investing in its shale resources in the Duvernay in west-central Alberta, apart from other oil and gas interests.
Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If the deal proceeds, Chevron Phillips will become the third largest producer of polyethylene in North America, behind Exxon-Mobil Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. It will also become the largest producer of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in the continent, ahead of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.
Another buyer may yet emerge for Nova, and Mubadala could also decide to keep a stake in Nova in any deal that arises, Reuters reported.
HDPEs are used in plastic water bottles, corrosion-resistant piping and plastic lumber. The global market for HDPEs is expected to hit US$85.19 billion this year.
""The Nova acquisition would increase ethylene merchant exposure for Chevron Phillips. After the recent ethylene capacity increase at Cedar Bayou, TX, Chevron Phillips was exposed to 500 thousand tonnes of ethylene to the merchant market, while Nova, post its acquisition of Williams Geismar (an LA cracker) is exposed to approximately one million tonnes of ethylene,"" said Ashish Chitalia, Wood Mackenzie chemicals principal analyst. ""Together, the companies would have ethylene volumes equivalent of a world-scale cracker size of 1.5 million tonnes.""
Nova is proceeding with a $2-billion expansion plan for their Sarnia polyethylene plant in Ontario this year. It's backed by $100 million through Ontario's Jobs and Prosperity Fund and $35 million through Ottawa's Strategic Investment Fund.
The potential acquisition comes as the country's petrochemicals industry is in the midst of a rebound, boosted by dirt-cheap natural gas prices.
Capital spending on industrial chemical industry projects in Canada this year is expected to jump by 65 per cent to $1.9 billion, the highest since $2.2 billion spent in 2014, according to a year-end members survey by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, which represents producers that contribute 75 per cent of the country's chemical products by value.
Rawlusyk sees a unique advantage for companies to build petrochemical plants in Canada, especially given the incentives offered by the previous government in Alberta.
""Certainly the attraction would be cheap ethane because natural gas prices are so low, and the market is pretty much balanced at the moment. There's been a lot of talk about another big ethane cracker being built in Alberta,"" said Rawlusyk. ""The government has offered a bunch of money for that as well. These are multi-billion investments for new crackers, and they would need some way to get incremental ethane out of the natural gas so there would need to be some investment in extraction facilities as well.""
Headquartered in Calgary, Nova Chemicals was founded in 1954. Over the years, it has diversified its business beyond foam packaging and insulation to foam beverage cups and containers.
Nova Chemicals reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $271 million in the first three months of 2019, down from $418 million a year earlier, according to its website.
Abu Dhabi acquired Nova Chemicals for $500 million in 2009 using its stated-owned International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), saving it from a financing restructuring due to its large debt. Since then, the company's business has grown rapidly, taking advantage of the shale-driven natural resources boom in North America. Two years ago, Abu Dhabi merged IPIC with Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets. The emirate has looked into consolidating its holdings and retrenching from some overseas businesses.
""The petrochemical market is consolidating, with the main players - ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, LyondellBasell, Dow - expanding organically or through M&A. Since 2018, many petrochemical companies are under pressure owing to the slow economic growth outlook, the credit crunch in India/China, US-China trade war and the plastic backlash,"" said Chitalia.
""The deal with Nova Chemicals would allow Chevron and Phillips 66 to diversify further into this market while increasing competitiveness and market reach. North American ethane feedstock advantage makes the region an ideal location for acquisitions or expansions in the ethylene-polyethylene sector.""
The potential acquisition comes after an Edmonton judge ordered Nova to pay Dow Chemicals $1.06 billion in damages in 2018 over a dispute around an ethylene plant in noskic@postmedia.com

If the deal proceeds, Chevron Phillips will become the third largest producer of polyethylene in North America, behind ExxonMobil Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. It will also become the largest producer of highdensity polyethylene (HD-PE) in the continent, ahead of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.
Another buyer may yet emerge for Nova, and Mubadala could also decide to keep a stake in Nova in any deal that arises, Reuters reported.
HDPEs are used in plastic water bottles, corrosion-resistant piping and plastic lumber. The global market for HDPEs is expected to hit US$85.19 billion this year.
""The Nova acquisition would increase ethylene merchant exposure for Chevron Phillips. After the recent ethylene capacity increase at Cedar Bayou, Texas, Chevron Phillips was exposed to 500 thousand tonnes of ethylene to the merchant market, while Nova, post its acquisition of Williams Geismar is exposed to approximately one million tonnes of ethylene,"" said Ashish Chitalia, Wood Mackenzie chemicals principal analyst. ""Together, the companies would have ethylene volumes equivalent of a world-scale cracker size of 1.5 million tonnes.""
Nova is proceeding with a $2 billion expansion plan for their Sarnia polyethylene plant in Ontario this year. It's backed by $100 million through Ontario's Jobs and Prosperity Fund and $35 million through Ottawa's Strategic Investment Fund.
The potential acquisition comes as the country's petrochemicals industry is in the midst of a rebound, boosted by dirt-cheap natural gas prices.
Capital spending on industrial chemical industry projects in Canada this year is expected to jump by 65 per cent to $1.9 billion, the highest since $2.2 billion spent in 2014, according to a year-end members survey by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, which represents producers that contribute 75 per cent of the country's chemical products by value.
Rawlusyk sees a unique advantage for companies to build petrochemical plants in Canada, especially given the incentives offered by the previous government in Alberta.
""Certainly the attraction would be cheap ethane because natural gas prices are so low, and the market is pretty much balanced at the moment. There's been a lot of talk about another big ethane cracker being built in Alberta,"" said Rawlusyk.
""The government has offered a bunch of money for that as well. These are multi-billion investments for new crackers, and they would need some way to get incremental ethane out of the natural gas so there would need to be some investment in extraction facilities as well.""
Headquartered in Calgary, Nova Chemicals was founded in 1954. Over the years, it has diversified its business beyond foam packaging and insulation to foam beverage cups and containers.
Nova Chemicals reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $271 million in the first three months of 2019, down from $418 million a year earlier, according to its website.
Abu Dhabi acquired Nova Chemicals for $500 million in 2009 using its stated-owned International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), saving it from a financing restructuring due to its large debt. Since then, the company's business has grown rapidly, taking advantage of the shale-driven natural resources boom in North America. Two years ago, Abu Dhabi merged IPIC with Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets. The emirate has looked into consolidating its holdings and retrenching from some overseas businesses.
""The petrochemical market is consolidating, with the main players - Exxon-Mobil, Saudi Aramco, LyondellBasell, Dow - expanding organically or through M&A. Since 2018, many petrochemical companies are under pressure owing to the slow economic growth outlook, the credit crunch in India/China, US-China trade war and the plastic backlash,"" said Chitalia.
""The deal with Nova Chemicals would allow Chevron and Phillips 66 to diversify further into this market while increasing competitiveness and market reach. North American ethane feedstock advantage makes the region an ideal location for acquisitions or expansions in the ethylene-polyethylene sector.""
The potential acquisition comes after an Edmonton judge ordered Nova to pay Dow Chemicals $1.06 billion in damages in 2018 over a dispute around an ethylene plant in Joffre, Alberta.

Major U.S. stock indexes climbed, snapping a two-day losing streak, as rising shares of energy companies helped the market's rally to resume.
Shares of Exxon Mobil, Hess, Phillips 66 and other energy companies rose after an attack on two oil tankers on one of the world's busiest energy-shipping routes.
The incident sent oil prices sharply higher on fears of a possible trade disruption, boosting the fortunes of energy stocks, which have struggled this quarter.
The S&P 500 added 11.80 points, or 0.4%, to 2891.64, as energy stocks rose by 1.2%, helping the broad index recoup the losses it suffered over Tuesday's and Wednesday's trading sessions.
Despite the gains, some money managers say the attacks add another major geopolitical concern for investors to consider on top of trade tensions between the U.S. and China and fears of slowing economic growth. The incidents took place in the Gulf of Oman, where four tankers were attacked last month, which the U.S. has blamed on Iran.
""There's a lot of 'risk-on' in the market, but this is going to be confusing for investors"" over the longer term, said Tom Stringfellow, president and chief investment officer of Frost Investment Advisors. ""There's going to be questions if this leads to bigger things or accelerates tensions.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 101.94 points, or 0.4%, to 26106.77, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 44.41 points, or 0.6%, to 7837.13.
Shares of Exxon Mobil added 65 cents, or 0.9%, to $74.68, helping to lift both the Dow industrials and S&P 500. Other gainers included Hess, up $1.60, or 2.8%, to $58.31, and Phillips 66, which rose $1.99, or 2.4%, to $85.24.
Still, energy stocks remain down 7.9% this quarter, worse than any other sector in the broad index, following a multiweek slide in oil prices.
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq are all on track to notch a second consecutive week of gains following a multiweek slide. Optimism over a potential interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve has been fueling the rebound, which got a boost on Thursday following an uptick in Americans applying for unemployment benefits.
The Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2%, while stocks in Shanghai and Shenzhen posted modest advances. At midday Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.3%. Also early in the Asian trading day, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.2%.

Initial jobless claims, a measure of how many workers were laid off across the U.S., increased 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 in the week ended June 8, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected 215,000 new claims.
Although initial jobless claims remain near historically low levels, the data add to a recent spat of lackluster economic figures that could push the Fed to act sooner rather than later on interest rates this year, analysts said. May jobs data for both the public and private sectors came in below expectations, building the case for a new round of monetary stimulus, while U.S. inflation has slowed.

Gasoline prices have been falling fast in recent weeks
as the price of crude oil has dropped
. Gas Buddy, a service that tracks gas prices around the country and guides consumers to cheap gas, said on Tuesday that the average nationwide price was $2.73 for a gallon of regular gas. Gas Buddy expects prices—already 6% lower than a year ago—to continue to drop.
In
a blog post on Tuesday
, Gas Buddy's head of petroleum analysis, Patrick Dehaan, said he expects the average price of regular-grade gas to fall as low as $2.59 this week.
The price of crude futures were down 2.6% to $51.90 Wednesday afternoon, after government statistics showed that U.S. crude supplies continue to build.
""The stifling overhang of trade fears will continue to dog investors and traders,"" Gas Buddy analyst Dan McTeague wrote.
Other analysts think the path of oil prices—and thus the price at the pump—isn't so easy to predict these days. Questions about Iranian and Venezuelan exports and other geopolitical issues mean that ""the uncertainty is large enough to swing the global oil market between a surplus and a deficit on a monthly basis,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Damien Courvalin wrote on Wednesday.
Indeed, gasoline prices
have been particularly turbulent this year
as oil has risen and fallen. In May, gasoline had
its largest seasonal price increase since 2011
.
And not every consumer has enjoyed the benefit of cheap gas. The price of gasoline varies by state, in part because of the cost of refining and transporting it, and any taxes or regulations. California prices are near $4, even as Gulf Coast states pay close to $2.
In California, gasoline prices have stayed high in part because refiners had more maintenance issues than usual. In addition, tight environmental regulations make it difficult for California gas stations to import gas from other states. If refiners can't turn crude into gasoline and stations can't bring it in from elsewhere, then supply shortages tend to force prices higher. But Dehaan said in an interview on Tuesday that those problems have been resolved, and California prices are now on the downswing. ""Capacity has rebounded,"" he said. ""Refining utilization is back up.""
Jeffrey Alan Dietert, vice president of investor relations at Phillips 66 (PSX), said on the company's first-quarter earnings call in April that the industry was seeing ""a lot of maintenance ongoing"" at refineries in California and elsewhere. Contacted by Barron's on Tuesday, Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss wrote that the company typically doesn't comment on the day-to-day operations of its refineries, but gave a basic overview of where things stand.
""I can confirm there is no planned maintenance work currently underway at our Los Angeles Refinery,"" he wrote. ""There is planned maintenance work currently underway at our San Francisco Refinery.""

| Jump to first hitUS President Donald Trump's threats to tax Mexican imports could disrupt a long-standing cross-border energy trade, hitting US refiners that use Mexican oil by boosting prices, and raising concerns about potential retaliation by the world's biggest buyer of US energy products, according to Reuters.
 Mexico sends 600,000 to 700,000 barrels of oil to the United States every day, mostly to refiners that process that crude into gasoline, diesel and other products. Mexico buys more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of US crude and fuel, more than any other country, and analysts are concerned that retaliatory tariffs from Mexico could disrupt that trade.
 Trump on Thursday vowed to impose a tariff on all goods coming from Mexico, starting at 5% and increasing monthly until the surge of undocumented immigrants from across the border subsides.
 The tariff would begin June 10, and so far Mexico has not said it would retaliate, as the two countries, along with Canada, are trying to finish a broad free-trade agreement to replace the 25-year-old NAFTA deal.
 A sharp decline in Mexican oil supplies could raise the costs of fuels if US refiners are forced to buy heavier crude grades from further away from the United States, which adds to shipping costs.
 Crude traders, however, noted that most Gulf Coast refiners that buy Mexican crude are located in so-called Foreign Trade Zones, which allow them to avoid tariffs so long as the refined products are exported - though these refiners also supply US markets.
 Refiners have been using Mexican heavy crude grades in part to offset the loss of barrels from Venezuela, which has been under US sanctions for months.
 Maya crude, Mexico's primary grade of oil, traded at a $6 a barrel discount to Brent, the international benchmark, on Thursday, according to analysts at Tudor, Pickering & Holt. They said a 5% tariff would reduce that discount by half, making those imports costlier.
 Discounts on Friday for Western Canadian Select, a rival grade to Maya, narrowed to $16 a barrel bid, from $16.60 on Thursday, traders said.
 The primary importers of Mexican crude include refineries owned by Valero Energy Corp, Phillips 66, Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp. Mexico accounted for about 9% of total US oil imports last year, according to TPH.
 US refiners use heavy crude oil to blend with lighter US supply to produce fuels, but reduced production from Canada and Mexico, along with sanctions on Venezuela, has squeezed that supply, making it more expensive.
 For Gulf Coast refiners already hit by Venezuela sanctions, Iran sanctions, Canada's cuts and OPEC cuts, this adds insult to injury, stated Sandy Fielden, an analyst at researcher Morningstar, adding, The number of alternative sources of heavy crude is narrowing.
 Weekly data shows US imports from Mexico since the beginning of March have averaged roughly 631,000 bpd, according to US Energy Information Administration figures.
 Phillips 66 and Exxon declined to comment. Refiners Valero, Marathon Petroleum Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron were not immediately available to comment. - PNA"

President Trump's
proposed tariffs on Mexico
could wreak havoc on the U.S. refining industry, potentially raising prices at the gas pump for American consumers as the summer driving season begins.
The energy industry could be among the hardest hit if tariffs are applied to oil imports from Mexico, which accounted for 9% of all U.S. crude imports last year, the third-highest share after Canada and Saudi Arabia. Any retaliatory move by Mexico could have severe short-term economic impacts in both countries.
The U.S. and Mexico have become more interdependent in recent years as U.S. oil production and fuel exports surged. Much of Mexico's oil production is absorbed by the U.S. Gulf Coast refining system, which in turn exports substantial volumes of gasoline and diesel back to Mexico.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Valero Energy Corp. and Chevron Corp. have been among the biggest importers of Mexican crude this year. U.S. refiners such as Valero, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp. would face significant challenges should Mexico counter with a tariff on their exports of gasoline and distillates such as diesel fuel, analysts said. Since 2013, those exports to Mexico have nearly tripled to 826,000 barrels a day from 352,000 barrels, according to Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.
""Imposing tariffs on Mexican products, particularly crude oil, could raise energy prices for U.S. consumers, disadvantage the U.S. refining industry and jeopardize passage"" of a new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, said Chet Thompson, president and CEO of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, a refining trade group.
Braden Reddall, a spokesman for Chevron, called for balancing any new tariffs ""against the potential for retaliatory actions that impair the development of new markets.""
Mr. Trump said on Twitter late Thursday that the U.S. would impose a 5% tariff on all goods from Mexico beginning next Friday until the country reduced the number of migrants attempting to cross illegally into the U.S. through the southern border. The White House hasn't said whether any industries might be exempted from its proposed tariff plan.
The announcement
sent shudders through stock, bonds and currency markets
, even as Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador
called for dialogue
.
U.S. refiners on the Gulf Coast are configured to process heavier grades of crude, including from Mexico. Imports from the country have grown more vital in the last year after the U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela and Canada curbed its production. Plants that rely on heavy crude may be forced to scale back, reducing output of gasoline supplies just as the country enters what is usually a high demand season, analysts said.
""The implication of that would be less gasoline produced, and prices would increase at the pump,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research for Morningstar Inc.
Other potential issues could mitigate price increases, such as if Mexico imposes tariffs on U.S. gasoline exports, Mr. Fielden said. If the U.S. levies last for some time, the liquidity of oil and gas products in global markets is likely to soften the impact as well, he added.
Exports have been a cash cow for refiners in recent years, helping many to return significant profits to shareholders. Processing fuel has been one of the most lucrative businesses in the energy industry since 2012.
Valero and Marathon Petroleum didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokesman for Phillips 66 declined to comment on the impact of the proposed tariffs but said the company supports Mr. Trump's efforts to boost domestic manufacturing.
