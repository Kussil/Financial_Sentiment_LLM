ANDX General Partner, Southwest and MPC entered into a Support Agreement (the &#147;Support Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions therein, ANDX General Partner and Southwest have agreed to deliver a written consent
covering all of the ANDX Common Units beneficially owned by them (the &#147;Covered Units&#148;) within two business days after the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act, approving the Merger, the Merger Agreement and any
other matters necessary for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement. As of May 7, 2019, ANDX General Partner and Southwest collectively owned 156,173,128 ANDX Common Units, representing
approximately 64% of the total ANDX Common Units issued and outstanding. The approval of the Merger Agreement requires the affirmative vote or consent of holders of a majority of the outstanding ANDX Common Units, which approval is expected to be
obtained through written consents to be provided in accordance with the Support Agreement. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Support Agreement also generally prohibits
