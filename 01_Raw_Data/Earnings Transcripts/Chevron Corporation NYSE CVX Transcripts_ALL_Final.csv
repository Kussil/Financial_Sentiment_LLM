CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is
being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.
Jake Robert Spiering
Director
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO,
Eimear Bonner, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are
available on Chevron's website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this
presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron continues to deliver strong
operational performance, maintain cost and capital discipline and consistently return cash to shareholders.
First quarter marked 9 consecutive quarters with adjusted earnings over $5 billion and adjusted ROCE
above 12%.
During the quarter, we also returned $6 billion in cash to shareholders, the eighth straight quarter over
$5 billion. We also grew production more than 10% from the same quarter last year and announced final
investment decisions to grow our renewable fuels and hydrogen businesses.
Earlier this month, we announced our third Future Energy Fund focused on venture investments in lower-
carbon technologies. The merger with Hess is advancing, and we intend to certify substantial compliance
with the FTC second request in the coming weeks. We believe that a preemption right does not apply to
this transaction and are confident this will be affirmed in arbitration. We expect the proxy for the Hess
shareholder vote to be mailed in April with a special meeting date in late May. This strategic combination
creates a premier energy company with world-class capabilities and assets to deliver superior shareholder
value, and we look forward to bringing the 2 companies together.
At TCO, we had achieved start-up of WPMP this month with the first inlet separator and pressure boost
compressor in service and conversion of the first metering station to low pressure now complete. Later
this quarter, we expect a second pressure boost compressor online and a third gas turbine generator to
provide power to the Tengiz grid. Metering station conversions are planned through the remainder of the
year as additional pressure boost compressors start up, keeping the existing plants full around planned
SGI and KTL turnarounds.
We continue to make significant progress on FGP and expect to have additional major equipment ready
for operations in the third quarter. Costs and scheduled guidance remain unchanged with FGP expected to
start up in the first half of 2025.
Now over to Eimear to discuss the financials.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
VP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center
Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter of strong earnings, ROCE and cash returns to shareholders.
We reported first quarter earnings of $5.5 billion or $2.97 per share. Adjusted earnings were $5.4 billion
or $2.93 per share. Cash flow from operations was impacted by an approximate $300 million international
upstream ARO settlement payment and $200 million for the expansion of the retail marketing network. We
also had a working capital build during the quarter consistent with historical trends.
Chevron delivered on all of its financial priorities during the quarter, an 8% increase in dividend per share;
organic CapEx aligned with ratable budget inclusive of progress payments for new LNG ships; sustained
net debt in the single digits while issuing commercial paper to manage timing of affiliate dividends and
working capital; and share repurchases of $3 billion.
Adjusted earnings were lower by $1 billion versus last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings were down due
to lower realization and liquids liftings. Partly offsetting were favorable tax impacts. Adjusted downstream
earnings were lower mainly due to timing effects associated with the rising commodity price environment.
All other decreased on higher employee costs and an unfavorable swing in tax items.
Adjusted first quarter earnings were down $1.3 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings were
down modestly. Higher liftings were more than offset by lower natural gas realizations. DD&A was higher
due to the PDC acquisition and Permian growth. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower mainly due to
lower refining margins and timing effects.
Worldwide oil equivalent production was the highest first quarter in our company's history. Production
was up over 12% from last year, including an increase of 35% in the United States largely due to the PDC
Energy acquisition and organic growth in the Permian Basin.
Looking ahead to the second quarter, we have planned turnarounds at TCO and several Gulf of Mexico
assets. Following another strong quarter in the Permian, production is trending better than our previous
guidance, and we now expect first half production to be down less than 2% from the fourth quarter.
Impacts from refinery turnarounds are mostly driven by El Segundo and Richmond. We anticipate higher
affiliate dividends in the second quarter largely from TCO. With the start-up of WPMP, we expect TCO's
DD&A to increase by approximately $400 million over the remainder of the year.
Share repurchases are restricted under SEC regulations through the Hess shareholder vote, after which
we intend to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate. We've published a new document with our
consolidated guidance and sensitivities that will be updated quarterly and posted to our website the month
prior to our earnings call.
Back to you, Jake.
Jake Robert Spiering
Director
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]
We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. Katie, please open the line.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Maybe we could start with Tengiz because there's movement there. And specifically, the effects of the
WPMP start-up, if you don't mind going into some detail. I think the market understands that it's FGP
phase that really rerates kind of TCO's distribution capacity. But if there's any incremental benefits from
WPMP starting up, whether it's reliability or potential to produce over nameplate or even just the CapEx
run rate and what it means for maybe an annualized TCO distribution at this stage, that would be very
helpful.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Sam, let me talk a little bit to the project and operational dimensions of this, and then I'll let Eimear
comment on the financial ramifications of that. So look, we're really pleased with the progress that's been
making and pleased that we've begun the initial start-up of WPMP with the first PBF compressor online and
processing crude through the plants after conversion of the first metering station.
It's an important milestone. I'm proud of the team and the work they've been doing. They've done
this safely. We're seeing initial operation that is well aligned with our expectations. In fact, we've been
encouraged by very strong production response from the wells that feed into this first metering station.
We now have the second metering station planned for conversion as off-line, and that conversion is
underway. And as we bring on more of the PBF compression capacity, we'll complete more metering
stations over the balance of the year.
What happens here is we get higher production because the wells are now flowing against lower back
pressure. And as I said, Sam, we've seen really strong response on this first set of wells. What that does
is it gives us a high degree of confidence in keeping the plants full all year long with the fact being that
we've got some turnarounds we have to do. We've got an SGI turnaround and a KTL turnaround, SGI this
quarter, KTL next quarter, to do some tie-ins and some other normal maintenance. But in the periods in
between those, it increases deliverability and the confidence of the plant will be full throughout that period
of time.
We've got a lot of project scope operational is the other thing that I just would remind you of. We're
producing from new wells. We've got upgraded to new utilities now, gathering system, a new control
center, power distribution system, 2 new, big-frame 9 gas turbine generators in service. So the reliability
of the infrastructure and all of the control networks and everything is significantly improved as we got
more modern equipment in place. So all of this reads through to higher degree of reliability, strong
production performance.
And last year was the second strongest year in the past several. So it gives us high confidence in
delivering what we've said we'll deliver there. And then as we get into the third quarter, we'll start
commissioning some of the process equipment as part of FGP, which, as you say, first half start-up next
year is when you see the incremental production come online.
So good progress all the way around. I'll reiterate that schedule and cost guidance are unchanged. And
we'll continue to provide details each quarter on milestones and progress as we proceed.
Eimear, maybe you can just talk about what that means financially.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, Sam, well, after years of investing, as the project starts up over the next couple of
years, we do expect the CapEx profile to continue to decline, and that will enable free cash flow over the
next couple of years to grow.
With WPMP, it will keep the plants full. So this will allow IBS business to generate significant cash, and
that will be available for distribution. With the second phase of the project then next year in '25, TCOs
free cash flow is going to grow even further because with that phase of the project, we get incremental
production.
So what does this mean for Chevron? Well, we expect $4 billion of free cash flow in 2025 and $5 billion in
2026. This is a $60 Brent. This will flow to us through a combination of dividends, so you'll see this come
through cash flow from operations and loan repayments, which will flow through cash for investing.
So we do expect dividends this year. We have guidance -- affiliate guidance to dividends for 2024. But
we've also included in the deck today the outlook for affiliate dividends for the second quarter, $1 billion to
$1.5 billion. And a significant portion of that is an assumption around TCO.
Operator
We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
My question is really on the exploration program. Specifically, you have an interesting position in West
Africa and Namibia. So maybe you can just give us some historical context of how you got involved here.
Is this an asset that you see a lot of opportunity in, especially given some of the announcements from
peers over the last couple of weeks? And how do you think about prosecuting it going forward?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thank you, Neil. We've got a nice portfolio of exploration opportunities around the world and including
numerous prospects on Block 90 in the Orange Basin offshore Namibia, which lies just outshore --
outbound of where there was a recent discovery announced by another company. We're planning to spud
the first exploration well in that block late this year or early next year based on rig availability. The rig will
be completed in early '25.
We farmed into another block, Block 82, which is further north in the Walvis space, and that was just
announced earlier this week. And as you know, there have been a number of discoveries made by
companies in the Orange Basin. Our block is on trend with those discoveries. We're encouraged by the
success we see from others. And this is certainly an area where the industry has had a high -- a good
batting average, a high degree of success. And we're pleased that we've got 2 blocks now offshore
Namibia. And of course, we'll talk to you more as we get into the exploration program there.
Operator
We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
You guys did a small deal look like on the retail marketing asset, adding over 200 stations in the Gulf
Coast and West Coast. I actually don't remember. I think since you've become the head of downstream,
say, call it, 20 years ago, you guys have been selling asset there. So is there a change of your view in
terms of the overall strategy we made to that part of the business? And whether that -- this deal you are
going to be owning the asset or that this is wholesale marketing [ drop ] network type of deal that you are
acquiring?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
Yes. Thank you, Paul. As you know, I come out of that part of the business. I love talking about retail.
Look, we've got 3 really strong brands around the world. Caltex internationally; in Asia, primarily; in
Middle East and Africa, a little bit. Chevron and Texaco here primarily in the Americas.
And you're right, we only own about 5% in the U.S., even less than 5% of our branded stations. So most
of our business is done through large retailers and distributors. We enter into agreements of supply
agreements and brand agreements with these marketers. And there are times, different mechanisms,
we use to support their investments. We've done a couple of deals here in the last quarter that are
substantial, that add a few hundred stations to our network. And as part of that, we advanced some cash
to support their brand conversion efforts, their investment in the network and to solidify our relationship
with really important customers of ours that ultimately sell on to consumers. And so you saw that
consume some cash.
It technically from an accounting standpoint doesn't get classified as capital, but we want to disclose it
because it is cash. And it helps us grow our branded sales. And so it's an important part of our business.
We're doing these kinds of deals all the time, Paul. They tend to be oftentimes smaller magnitude, so they
don't necessarily get to a size where we would mention it the way that we did today. But we won't own
these stations. They're owned by really strong independent retailers. Thanks for the question.
Operator
We'll go next to Betty Jiang with Barclays.
Wei Jiang
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Mike, just -- so we're seeing that the U.S. operations look pretty strong quarter, especially with Permian
holding in better than expected relative to your expectations. Could you just talk about what drove the
better performance in the Permian and how you think the rest of the year unfolds? And then just anything
else within the U.S. that you want to highlight?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the Permian was good, 859,000 barrels a day, down about
1% from the fourth quarter of last year, stronger than what we had anticipated. Really good, strong
performance in our company-operated business, building off the momentum from the fourth quarter of
last year. We have seen reliability improvements that translate into a slightly less decline in our base
production.
We saw a significantly shorter frac to POP cycle time, so between completed frac and when we put it on
production. So that resulted in a few more wells being POP-ed in the first quarter, which you see in the
production. Well performance itself was generally aligned with our expectations. And so we've been talking
a lot about type curves the last few quarters. We're seeing strong performance that's aligned with or even
a little bit stronger than what we expected.
And then we also saw some good contributions from our royalty acreage, which is the highest-return
barrels we have because we really have no investment there and it's attractive acreage. Others are
developing it. And we saw increased activity that resulted in increased royalty production.
NOJV, right on plan with what we expected and a lot of visibility into the non-operated joint venture
portfolio for this year, more even than last year at this time, and confidence that, that will deliver. So all of
that translated into a very strong first quarter.
Eimear mentioned that we now expect our first half to be better than we'd previously guided. We said 2%
to 4% down versus fourth quarter of last year. We now think we'll be less than 2% down. And then, of
course, the back half of the year, we had another frac spread. We've got more wells online and expect to
exit the year around 900,000 barrels a day. So really strong performance there and consistent with the
momentum that you've seen in prior quarters.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
The -- I guess the other thing I would mention relative to the U.S. more broadly is the Anchor project in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico is we've guided towards midyear start-up of that. It's right on track. The
floating production unit is being commissioned. As we speak, we've got both buyback gas and back oil
in the facilities. So that means the pipelines, the process units are now charged with live hydrocarbons.
We're commissioning some of the subsea infrastructure, including flow lines.
The completion of the first well is in progress. Second well is drilled and will be completed shortly. Third
well is being drilled right now. So we'll talk more about this, but everything is right on track for start-up
of Anchor midyear. And then, of course, we've got other Gulf of Mexico projects as well that are kind of
stacked up right behind Anchor over subsequent quarters. So the outlook in the U.S. is especially strong.
Operator
We'll go next to Josh Silverstein with UBS.
Joshua Ian Silverstein
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
You had around $1 billion of debt this quarter to manage some of the working capital and really
distribution timing. Do you see the cash balance growing sequentially? Did you repay the commercial
paper in 2Q? Just wanted to get a sense of where the cash outlook may go sequentially.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Eimear, why don't you take that?
Eimear P. Bonner
VP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center
Yes. Josh, yes, so we had some commercial paper issued in the first quarter, and it was just to manage
short-term liquidity. Timing of affiliate dividends can be a bit lumpy, repatriation of cash can be a bit
lumpy. So this was normal business for us in the first quarter.
I think in terms of what to expect in terms of cash on the balance sheet, I mean, we target to hold about
$5 billion in cash, and that will bounce around as well. But I think $5 billion is a good number. We have
access to lots of liquidity and commercial paper, bond investors, credit facilities. So while we've had higher
cash in the balance sheet in the past, holding excess cash with low debt and lots of access to liquidity can
be a drag in returns. So we're quite comfortable with the $5 billion cash, and that's a good number for you
to focus on there.
Operator
We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I wanted to ask a follow-up on the Permian. So you put out there the updated well productivity slide,
which is very helpful. But a few quarters ago, Mike, you talked about some of the broader constraints in
the Permian, whether it's CO2, water handling and so on. It doesn't look like it's impacted your volumes in
the near term, which have performed very well. So could you just refresh us on if anything has changed in
your views on that there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks, Biraj. Nothing's really changed. I mean this is a very large base business now with thousands
of wells over a very large footprint. And it's important that we focus not only on productivity, efficiency
and reliability and drilling and completions, but also in all aspects of operations. And that's midstream
takeaway, it's gas processing, it's water handling.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
And we've got more development underway this year in the New Mexico portion of the Delaware, which is
going to require a build-out of some of this capability, which will be part of our capital program addresses.
But you really have to stay on top of base business reliability on all these things. Seismic is another one
we've seen some issues on.
And so they're all part of managing the business for safety and reliability each and every day. We had a
quarter -- a couple of quarters back where a number of those things were a challenge. And the current
quarter, we saw really good performance.
Last thing I might mention, which might be implied in your question, you see some talk about the
takeaway capacity out of the basin and are people constrained, is that impacting particularly gas prices
within the other commodities. We're covered on takeaway capacity out of the basin on oil, NGL and gas
well out into the future. And so we're not exposed to any in-basin discounted pricing as a result of that.
Operator
We'll go next to Nitin Kumar with Mizuho.
Nitin Kumar
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
Mike, I just wanted to maybe get an update on Venezuela. There were some reports that Biden
administration is reinstating some of the export bans on that country. Specifically said that Chevron was
not included, but just your thoughts on sort of the future of oil production and exports from the country
and how it would impact Chevron?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks, Nitin. So you might recall that the Department of Treasury and OPEC, a division within
treasury, has issued a couple of different, what are called general licenses for operations for companies in
Venezuela. There's one called General License 41, which primarily pertains to our position in the country.
There's some specific licenses as well that kind of go along with that. And then there had been a second
one that was issued subsequently called General License 44, which applied more broadly. That's the one
where the administration has announced some changes. And those don't really impact us. There have
been no changes to GL 41. And so we're not really affected by the news you've read about recently.
I'll just remind you, we're not putting new capital into Venezuela right now. All the spending is really self-
funded from the cash from operations. We've been lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S., which has been
helpful for the U.S. refining system, not just ours but others as well.
And since that license was issued now a little bit more than a year ago, we've seen production at the
joint ventures that we're participating in increase from about 120,000 barrels a day at the time that, that
license was issued to about 180,000 barrels a day now. So that's an update. There are some -- maybe it
might be worth reminding just how the financial side of that works because it's a little bit different than
some of the other parts of our production. So Eimear, do you want to touch on that?
Eimear P. Bonner
VP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center
Yes. Nitin, just as a reminder, for Venezuela, we do cost accounting, not equity accounting. So Chevron
is not recording the production here or the reserves. We record earnings when we receive cash, and that
shows up under other income and income statement. Just to put this into context, in 2023, the cash was
modest, probably less than 2% cash flow from operations.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2024 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2024
I wanted to ask about the divestment program. I know when the Hess deal was announced, you discussed
$10 billion to $15 billion. But given that's in a bit of a holding pattern here, I'm just wondering what you
expect the cadence or the target for divestments to be. I think historically, you've done about $2 billion a
year. So that's not too far from what the guidance was with the Hess deal. Just trying to try and lay those
2 numbers and getting a sense of what the divestment program could look like while that deal is in a bit
of a holding pattern. If you could just remind us the assets that have been discussed in the market, that
would be great.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Yes, sure. Happy to do that, Jason. So the first thing is you're right. We're always high-grading our
portfolio. And it's not because we need the cash. You already covered the strength of the balance sheet.
But it's really to set value to optimize our portfolio. We find times there are things that don't compete for
capital in our portfolio and they fit better with somebody else.
They tend to be early-in-life assets. We were at Rosebank and divested that a few years ago or things that
are much later in life and might fit better with somebody who works those kinds of assets.
Over the last decade or so, 2012 through 2023, we divested about $35 billion worth. Our long-term
history has been about $2 billion per year, maybe 1% of our capital employed, give or take. And our
guidance for this year is 1% to 2%, so it's pretty consistent with history. We did say that upon the closure
of the Hess transaction, we're going to add some assets that are going to be highly attractive for capital
investment. And that means as you look through the rest of the portfolio, if we stay capital-disciplined,
there are probably some things that we might otherwise have invested in that now we would choose not
to. And so that's where the 10 to 15 guidance came from. That would still stand upon closure.
The things we're doing now are things we would have done in the normal course. And so they're not really
related to high-grading post the Hess addition. The things that are in the public domain, we talked about
Myanmar, which we exited as of April 1. We've announced that we intend to exit the Congo, and we've got
a deal there. We expect that to close before the end of the year.
We have talked about our position in unconventionals in Canada and in Kaybob, Duvernay, which is a nice
asset, which has some growth opportunities, but it may be a better fit for others. So we're looking at
alternatives there. And then also the Haynesville, we paused our development activity in the Haynesville
last year, and that's another one that we think may fit better with others. So I think those are the ones
that are out in the public right now, Jason.

Given the launch of Future Energy Fund III, can you give us a thought of what you saw success cases
coming out of I and II that caused you to move to III? And maybe compare and contrast how you do it
yourself in-house solar to hydrogen, for example, versus where you might see third parties to try new
technologies.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So I appreciate that. This is one that we probably haven't talked about with investors as much as
some of the other parts of our business. Funds 1 and 2 were smaller, $100 million, $300 million. And
they're not actually fully subscribed yet, but they're getting there, which is why we announced fund #3.
We've been in the venture investing business for 1/4 of a century, so going back to the late '90s when we
first set up our venture investing organization.

And in the Future Energy Funds, which are those that are really need on energy transition themes,
through Funds I and II, we've invested more than 30 companies already. We're collaborating with 250 or
so other co-investors in these companies. We can serve as a pilot bed for their technology so we can help
them bring things from the lab and kind of bench scale out into the real world.
And I've visited last year, one of our carbon capture pilots in the San Joaquin Valley with a company
that's got some really interesting technology to help us improve the efficiency, reduce the cost for carbon
capture. And so we're looking at things like industrial decarbonization, hydrogen, emerging mobility,
energy decentralization, the circular carbon economy. And what we're really looking to do is support
innovation in things that we probably aren't doing within the company, within our own R&D or scale up. As
you mentioned, the projects in the Permian Basin or in the San Joaquin Valley, the solar to green hydrogen
is using established technologies that are well proven.
What we're doing in our venture investing is trying to develop these new technologies, new materials, new
novel ways to integrate AI and other kinds of technology systems to help solve some of these problems.
And hopefully, we find things that will help our business and help the world.
Last thing I'll say is over the 25 years, we've more than earned our money back in our return on our
investment. Not every one of these companies is successful, but we've seen a lot of technologies move
into our business. We've seen a lot of the companies become successful. And there's a lot of innovation
going on out there. This allows us to leverage ourselves into smaller start-up innovation that we might not
otherwise see. So it's been a very, very positive for us, and we're excited to announce the new fund.

Can we talk a little bit about Eastern Med? I know at one point, operations shut down. It sounds like
everything is back up and running. But also you would kind of tie that into Egypt a little bit, where there's
been some exploration talk and in the government trying to do some things to improve the overall
investment, I guess, environment there.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, you bet. So first of all, we are back in full operations in the Eastern Med. We've -- Tamar was down
for about a month at the very beginning of hostilities. But we're excited about the opportunities there.
Just to remind you, we've got the 2 existing platforms, Tamar and Leviathan, in service. And we've really
structured our development plans there to focus on capital efficiency, higher returns, to the earlier answer,
things we've got to compete for capital in our portfolio.
Since we've closed on the Noble acquisition, we've increased production at Tamar and Leviathan by more
than 10% just through debottlenecking and reliability. We've sanctioned projects at both of those that
are currently in progress that will increase production by another 40% over the next couple of years. And
we're looking at larger expansion, particularly for Leviathan, where we've got a number of concepts that
are being evaluated. Obviously, in the current environment, we're moving carefully with development of
those.
You mentioned Egypt. We've got a discovery at Argus. We expect another appraisal well there in late
this year or early next year to better characterize the field and refine our development plan. We've got a
number of other blocks that have not been drilled yet that we shot a seismic on. And we plan to spud a
well in Block 4 there before the end of this year. And so it's an area that I think has got real prospectivity.
As you look at growth in both the near term, with the projects I mentioned and then the longer expansion
of existing and exploration prospectivity, it's a part of our portfolio that I expect us to see growth from
over the coming decade.

I know we've covered a lot of ground this morning. We talked about the Permian productivity, which looks
really good. But could you just touch on the DJ? And that production looks stronger than we expected.
And then also any political risk you might want to comment on that there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So yes, first quarter production in the DJ was above 400,000 barrels a day, kind of higher than what
our long-term guidance is. We had timing -- a lot of fourth quarter '23 wells put on production there. You'd
typically expect some weather-related downtime in Colorado over the first quarter. We saw some of that,
but less than what we had planned for. So production was good.
Second quarter, there's maybe some minimal impacts that we expect from a third-party gas plant that's
had an outage. But continued strong performance there thus far in the second quarter. These are high
cash margin, low-breakeven barrels that we're really pleased to have in our portfolio. If you go back 3
years ago, we didn't have anything in DJ. We were not talking 400,000 barrels a day of production there.
We plan to hold our plateau there around 400,000 barrels a day, and it will fluctuate a little bit based on
the timing of bringing new pads on and completion of wells, et cetera. But it's a really strong asset for us.
Let me talk about the politics and kind of the operating environment a little bit, and then maybe I'll have
Eimear just touch on PDC and the benefits of that. But Colorado is a state where energy is an important
part of the economy. And I grew up there. The environment is very important to the people and the
state as well. And I think their goal has been to be a leader in responsible development and to recognize
the important economic contribution that our industry makes to the states. I'm confident that, that will
continue to be the case.
We've got good relationships with members of the legislature, with the executive branch, with the
governor. And as the largest oil and gas producer in the state with over 1,000 employees who live and
work there and we were a significant investor there, we engage broadly within the community. And I think
there's a recognition that responsible development in Colorado is what everybody wants and what we are
committed to.
And there's -- can be some noise around ballot proposals. There can be some noise around legislative
proposals. But we're confident that the state is interested in working with us to be a responsible player
and for this to be an important part of the economy. Eimear, maybe PDC, some of the benefits, just so
people are reminded of that.
Eimear P. Bonner
VP, CFO, & President of Chevron Technical Center
Yes. It's been about 9 months since we closed with PDC Energy. We're really pleased with the progress
that we're seeing, the synergies. On the CapEx side, to date, we've captured $500 million, which is $100
million more than what we had initially guided to. We're also seeing capture on the OpEx side as well. So
we're nearing $100 million there.
The teams are continuing to integrate. We're bringing the best of both companies together and building
a development playbook focused on optimizing returns in the basin. We're realizing strong free cash flow
from these assets. So we're ahead of pace for the incremental $1 billion in annual free cash flow that we
guided to.

Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I wanted to bring it back to TCO. And Mike, I think you've talked in the past about how there is some
similarity in the design between [ WPMP ] and FGP as a result of that. As you bring WPMP online, it
helps derisk part of the FGP ramp as well. I was wondering if you could remind us what some of that
commonality is. And as you look at the milestones you look out over the next few months at WPMP, which
are the ones that you think about as being key to help derisk FGP as well?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So it's -- just to remind everybody, this is a massive field. Some of you have visited it. And FGP, the
Future Growth Project, is taking things we did almost 20 years ago now with the second generation plant
in sour gas injection, where we injected about half of the sour gas. And we're now injecting all the sour
gas, increasing production. And at the same time, we're reducing back pressure on the field and using
compression to push the production into the facilities so that we're not relying on field pressure to do that.
And that increases the life and longevity of the production out of the field.
The other thing this project brings with it is what I've described sometimes as urban renewal. And it takes
infrastructure that was built back even before Kazakhstan was independent. And it brings power and utility
infrastructure, control infrastructure up to modern-day technology and modern-day standards. So the
projects are quite integrated.
The start-up sequencing in terms of what you do to walk down systems, ensure they're ready for
operation, do all the testing and start-up is very similar, whether you're in one portion of the project or
another. And the productivity of the field resources that we see on WPMP reads across to FGP as well.
And so while they're fundamentally different project scopes and objectives, so much of the work is similar
across equipment and the commissioning and start-up activities that I think the positive progress we're
making, the success we're seeing in commissioning and start-up at FGP reads straight -- at WPMP, reads
straight across to FGP as well.

Maybe one on the renewable side of your portfolio. I mean you announced FIDs on a couple of different
renewable projects, one in biofuels, one in solar to hydrogen. Can you provide some color on what
underpins confidence in these specific projects, whether it's commercial or technical or regulatory support?
And do you see further opportunities to develop similar projects in the portfolio going forward? Or are
there specific things about these ones in particular that make them attractive?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the 2 projects. One is an oilseed processing plant in our joint venture with Bunge. It's a project at
Destrehan, Louisiana. And so FID was announced for a new oilseed processing plant there. This one will
feature a very flexible design, and that's important because it gives you feedstock flexibility, which matters
in any fuels manufacturing business. So in this case, we can process soybeans and softseeds, but we can
also be able to process winter oilseed crops, things like winter canola, cover crest. And so it gives us a
greater range of potential feedstocks that can then feed into our renewable fuels business, particularly
the Geismar real diesel project, which will start up later this year. And it's really important that we have
exposure across these value chains.
The margins can move from the crush margin into the upgrading margin or what you consider the refining
margin, into the marketing margin. And just like in our traditional business, being able to catch all margin
across the value chain as it moves is important. Having flexibility, scale and reliability are important. So all
of those underpin the investment decision there.

The project in California on green hydrogen is smaller in scale. And it really uses existing solar production
capacity. We've got a 5-megawatt production facility in our Lost Hills oilfield in Kern County. And we're
going to produce about a metric ton per day of hydrogen for retail fuel stations. So we're using existing
infrastructure. We're integrating into the value chain. We've got another venture that is building hydrogen
refueling facilities in California. And so we're leveraging existing assets, existing value chains and
capabilities to invest here. As I say, smaller scale, and I don't want to overplay it, but it's very consistent
with our strategy. And these things have got to start small and then scale. And so we're pleased with both
of these.
There are markets, maybe to your point about economics that are, in some ways, heavily influenced by
government policy, be it the renewable fuel standard and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which affect
renewable fuels or some of the things in the investment or the inflation reduction act that affect hydrogen.
And so it makes them a little bit different than our traditional business, which really works off market
fundamentals. But we look at a lot of cases there, and we invest in projects where we believe there's
confidence that over time, we can generate a good return.

So my question is on West Coast refining. We now have one West asset producing gasoline on the West
Coast, and TMX should be increasing the availability of heavy crudes once it's ramped. But it's a tough
regulatory climate. And you're well positioned as one of the players that still has multiple assets in
California. How are you thinking about that region today? And should we see structurally higher gasoline
margins in California given we've had some capacity come out?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, look, we've been in California for our entire existence, 145 years. We've got an integrated value
chain that allows us to serve 2 competitive refineries and advantaged logistics that take us out into a
market where we've got a very strong brand and where the demand for all forms of energy continues to
grow, be it power, be it transportation fuels. It's an economy that is large and demand continues to go up.
That said, the policy environment has been one that is geared towards reducing investment in traditional
energy, encouraging investments in these lower-carbon energies. And you've seen assets go out of the
system, fossil fuel-fired power plants. There's a lot of questions about the one remaining nuclear power
plant in the state. And you've seen refineries close down, as you say, some permanently, some to convert
to uses, including to renewable fuels. And what that does is it creates a tighter supply-demand balance,
particularly as demand continues to be strong and you need to have strong operations out of that entire
system or you need to bring in supplies from somewhere else if you've got planned or unplanned issues
that the system is dealing with.
And so on an average, what does that mean? It means margins are probably under more pressure. It
means reliable operations are very important. And it's a place where we've operated for a long time and
expect to continue to do so. But putting new investment into the state is a different question. And I think
we've been pretty clear that we've got a global portfolio and we'll invest where we see the best conditions,
and I wouldn't describe California that way today.

Mike, can you help me understand a bit the sequencing of the base case on the Hess timetable? I've read
all the documents, but just to get your sort of view. We've got a shareholder vote in May and we got
limbo pending regulatory issues, but obviously, importantly, the arbitration. But maybe just talk about the
arbitration timetable.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So there are, I think, really 3 things, if you're looking at sequencing and timing here. One is the
shareholder vote. And as I said, the proxy will be mailed out in April, and the shareholder vote will occur
in May. You've got regulatory approval through the FTC, and we're making good progress on that. We're
working closely with the FTC in respect to their role in the process and expect us to be substantially
complete with that here by midyear.
And then we have the arbitration, which is, I think, a little bit less well defined at this point. The specific
scheduling and time line will be established by the arbitration tribunal. In our S-4, we indicated that Hess
has asked the tribunal to hear the merits of the cases in the third quarter with an outcome in the fourth
quarter, which would allow us to close the transaction shortly thereafter. We see no legitimate reason to
delay that time line. It's consistent with what Exxon has outlined is what they would expect. But I can't
say that's exactly how it unfolds because we haven't seen specific scheduling from the tribunal yet.

We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
My question is on broad capital spend question specifically. Could you just maybe speak to -- do you have
sort of broad strokes what percent of total spend would be directed towards the New Energies and maybe
the Chevron technology ventures? And I'm just wondering how you think about margins, even though it's
still early for some, how the margins of these compare to your higher-return traditional margin business.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So there's a couple of kind of broad framing points, I think, to bear in mind as you think about that.
Number one is we've guided to a long-term capital spend at around $16 billion. This year, we've got $15.5
billion to $16.5 billion as a range. And we intend to be very disciplined with our capital investment and
only invest in the most attractive opportunities.
We've also indicated that over a period of time, beginning in 2022 through 2028, I think it was when we
announced our -- we had our energy transition spotlight, that we expected to spend about $10 billion in
our New Energies business over that period of time, $8 billion in kind of the newer -- emerging business
lines of carbon capture and storage, renewable fuels and hydrogen and then another couple of billion in
decarbonizing our own operations and businesses.
It's not completely ratable. And that is a guide that we may or may not achieve. We may be a little
below that, we may be a little above that, depending upon how these opportunities mature in new
businesses. And to the earlier question, we need to be sure we've got confidence when we're putting
capital, particularly large capital, some of the smaller things to help accelerate technology, learning, et
cetera, like our venture investments, which tend to be a few millions of dollars in any particular company.
We recognize the risk-return equation there. But larger investments, we've got to have a belief that this
is a business that's going to deliver a return over time, and we're on the path to building a portfolio of
businesses that will do that. And so that $10 billion is a guide, but we'll invest in things that make sense,
and we'll explain the numbers if they end up a little bit different than that.
And so what that can tell you is the majority of our spend is still going into our traditional business
because the majority of the world's energy is still provided by our traditional business, and we've got an

obligation to meet that demand as long as it's there. But we're going to be very disciplined in what we
invest in and only invest in the highest-return opportunities. And so each year, we issue specific guidance
that we can -- you can look at. But longer term, I think you have to stay within those broad parameters
and expect us to remain disciplined.

Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of

Jake Spiering
Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Jake Spiering,
General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are
on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's
website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this
presentation. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron delivered another year of solid
results in 2023. During a time of geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainty, our objective remained
unchanged: safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon.
Our clear and consistent approach resulted in an adjusted ROCE of 14% and enabled a record $26 billion
in cash returned to shareholders while growing production to a company record. We also successfully
integrated PDC Energy and announced the Hess acquisition. We're now focused on the FTC second request
and expect to file the draft S-4 later this quarter with closing anticipated around the middle of the year.
And we continue to take action in lowering the carbon intensity of our operations and growing lower-
carbon businesses, advancing foundational projects in both hydrogen and carbon capture. Over the past
5-year commodity cycle, with prices high, low and everywhere in between, Chevron led the peer group in
what we believe are the most important measures that create value.
We were the most capital efficient while managing unit costs well below inflation and many peers. Capital
and cost discipline always matter in a commodity business. Combining this discipline with our focused
portfolio of advantaged assets, Chevron is able to lead the peer group in returning cash to shareholders.
Our 5-year dividend growth rate was greater than the S&P 500 and more than double our nearest peer.
Surplus cash was returned to our shareholders in each of the past 5 years through share buybacks. Our
track record is proven, and we intend to continue growing value for our shareholders in any environment.
In the Permian, we delivered on our full year production guidance and set a quarterly record of 867,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day while building our DUC inventory in the fourth quarter. Looking to the year
ahead, our program is back-end loaded as we plan to continue to build our DUC inventory before adding
an additional completion crew in the second half of the year. As a result, we expect production in the first
half of the year to be down from the fourth quarter by about 2% to 4% before climbing toward a 2024 exit
rate around 900,000 barrels per day.
Chevron is a clear leader in Permian financial returns with our unique royalty advantage and strong
execution across a diverse portfolio. We have strong momentum and expect to achieve 1 million barrels of
oil equivalent per day in 2025.

At TCO, we're making progress towards the first phase of WPMP FGP startup. This slide shows how the
project fits within the overall field and facilities. The field, currently flowing at high pressure, continues to
keep the existing plants full. In fact, 2023 net production was the highest since 2020.
We've completed a lot of project scope that is already operational. TCO is producing from the new wells.
The upgraded and new utilities, gathering system, control center and power distribution system are all
currently in operation.
For WPMP, we're focused on starting up major equipment including gas turbine generators, pumps and
compressors. We expect to hand over to operations the first pressure boost compressor in March for final
dynamic commissioning. Once we have PBF compression online, WPMP startup is expected to begin in the
second quarter when the first metering station is converted to low pressure, which will enable increased
flow rates.
Low-pressure production streams going back to existing process units will be driven by the pressure boost
compression. At the same time, production from metering stations not yet converted will continue to flow
in the high-pressure system. We expect metering station conversions through the remainder of the year
as additional pressure boost compressors start-up, keeping the existing plants full around planned KTL and
SGI turnarounds.
For FGP, we're focused on starting up additional gas turbine generators and compressors along with
multiple processing units. The sour gas injection facilities have already been handed over to operations for
a final commissioning. FGP startup is expected in the first half of next year when incremental production
enabled by fields conversion to low pressure will be processed in the new 3GP facility.
Since last quarter, 2 boilers came online and 2 gas turbine generators have delivered power. We've seen
improvement in work scope delivery and have been working through additional discovery items. We'll
continue to update you on progress and remain focused on key milestones to deliver a safe and reliable
startup.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $2.3 billion or $1.22 per share. Adjusted earnings
were $6.5 billion or $3.45 per share. Included in the quarter were $3.7 billion in charges preannounced in
January. Foreign currency charges were almost $480 million.
Our 2023 CapEx included $650 million of inorganic acquisitions and around $450 million invested in legacy
PDC assets post closing. Excluding these items, CapEx was about 5% above budget after 3 consecutive
years below.
Share repurchases matched the third quarter. Our balance sheet remained strong, ending the year with a
net debt ratio comfortably in the single digits.
Turning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were higher than last quarter by roughly $730 million. Adjusted
upstream earnings improved due to higher liftings, in line with record quarterly production and favorable
timing effects.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased on lower refining margins, partially offset by a favorable swing
in timing effects. All other benefited from lower corporate taxes and employee costs.
For the full year, adjusted earnings decreased nearly $12 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted
upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower prices. Adjusted downstream earnings were lower
largely due to declining refining margins. Other segment earnings improved on lower employee costs and
higher interest income.

Solid financial performance enabled Chevron to deliver again on all 4 of its financial priorities. We
announced an 8% increase in our dividend, reflecting our confidence in expected future free cash flow
growth.
We maintained capital discipline in both traditional and new energies. We reduced debt by over $4
billion, including all debt assumed in the PDC acquisition. And we repurchased about 5% of our shares
outstanding.
Last year, we produced more oil and gas than in any other year in the company's history, including a
record number of LNG cargoes out of Australia. We expect 2024 production to be higher again by 4% to
7%.
Our plans include production growth in the DJ Basin with a full year of legacy PDC operations and
continued organic growth in the Permian. Our guidance this year includes an estimated impact from asset
sales as we further high-grade our portfolio.
Looking ahead, our first quarter downtime estimate includes around 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent
per day associated with January's cold weather in North America. Earnings estimates from refinery
turnarounds are mostly driven by Pascagoula.
Share repurchases in the quarter will continue to be restricted under SEC regulations. Depending on
commodity prices and margins, affiliate dividends are estimated around $4 billion, roughly flat with last
year. We do not expect significant affiliate dividends in the first quarter. The difference between affiliate
earnings and dividends is expected to decrease in the second half of the year after TCO startup of WPMP.
Our CapEx guidance range is unchanged from the December budget announcement. In prior years, our
CapEx rate in the first half of the year was about 20% lower than the second half. Our price sensitivities
have increased at higher production levels. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG
sales, and less than 10% relates to North America natural gas liquids.
Back to you, Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
In closing, our priorities are clear: safely execute with excellence, maintain capital and cost discipline
and return cash to shareholders. We're excited about the pending Hess acquisition, which will further
strengthen Chevron.
I also want to personally thank Pierre for his invaluable contributions over his 35-year career with our
company. He's been an exceptional strategic partner to me and an outstanding leader, helping guide
Chevron to create significant value for shareholders. I wish him all the best in his retirement.

And thanks for all the help over recent years. I feel compelled to ask you a question on buybacks because
this is your last time, but I'll try and resist.
So the question is on the Permian. You had a very strong production number in Q4, quite an inflection
from what we've seen in the last few quarters. And I was interested in particular the comment on that
volume growth alongside building the DUC inventory.
So presumably, the non-op side was a nice contribution in Q4. So could you just give some clarity on the
bridge sort of 3Q to 4Q because the market has been concerned about you hitting the numbers, at least
for this year, most recently.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So in the third quarter, non-op was a little light. But in the fourth quarter, it came back. It didn't end
the year, non-op and royalty are right where we guided to from the beginning of the year.
So through the -- through a year, the quarterly ups and downs on some of these things can create some
questions, but it came in right as we guided to it in the mid-teens. The story on the fourth quarter was
really strong execution.
We had more POPs. We -- because we had faster drilling and faster cycle time on completions, we had a
shorter cycle time from frac to POP. So all of those increased. And as you noted, we did continue to build
our DUC inventory because drilling performance was so strong.
A couple of other things. POPs in the fourth quarter were weighted towards New Mexico. We had guided
towards activity that would lead to more POPs in New Mexico in the second half of the year. Those wells
are more productive than kind of on average than the rest of the portfolio. So that flows through.
And then the final thing that I would point to is we had higher reliability. You'll recall in the third
quarter, we talked a little bit about some midstream constraints and other things that weren't related to
completions or POPs or anything else, but there were constraints on flow.
We had fewer frac hits. We had fewer scheduled delays, weather downtime and midstream issues in the
quarter. So all of that contributed to the strong performance there in the fourth quarter, and we ended the
year right on our guidance.

Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
The -- my question is on Slide 6, the TCO update. It sounds like the schedule and the cost guidance that
was provided in November is still on track. But for us non-engineers maybe, Mike, you can kind of walk
us through the schematic and help us understand what these boxes are the critical path issues that we
should be focused on.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So you're right, Neil, the schedule and cost guidance is unchanged. I apologize for a more complex
slide than we usually put out in front of you. But we want to be as transparent as we can and help people
understand what's going on there at the field.
Last quarter, we talked about our action plan, and we're seeing improved productivity. We shifted scope
amongst contractors. We've added more engineering support in the field. And as we move through this,
we're encountering discovery work as we expected. We found some around piping stress and alignment
that we're working on right now.
The key thing to think about here is first of all, there's a lot of stuff that's up and running. All the new
wells are producing right now. All this infrastructure in terms of utility and power distribution and control
center is up and running.
And as we -- so that's keeping the plants full, and we saw a really strong performance last year, I
mentioned the strongest in 4 years and the fourth strongest in the history of the field. So we're seeing
good deliverability out of the new wells, which is the key thing for production this year is keeping those
plants full while we begin to convert the field from pushing into a high-pressure plant to lower back
pressure on the field, which improves deliverability from the wells and allows us to extend the life of the
field and get up to 1 million barrels a day.
So when we begin converting these metering stations and there are 21 of them, we will then take
production from a metering station now that is producing under low pressure. And we'll boost that back up
to get into the existing plant.
As we get more and more of those, converted more of these pressure boost compressors online, we'll
get the whole field now producing against the lower back pressure, which gives us a lot of excess well
capacity. And it ensures that we are going to keep the plant full.
And as we then bring on the new process equipment, we start to route that low-pressure production into
a plant that will run at lower pressure. And so that's really the kind of the high-level description of what
we're trying to convey there. And we've got a legend that shows you certain things we're going to begin
startup in various quarters.
For FGP, we're focused on commissioning the major equipment there that will allow us to bring up the
plant that will take us to 1 million barrels a day. And we're transferring learnings from compressors,
pumps and other things that we're working on now, walking down the critical substations. And we'll
continue to provide updates on the key milestones here. We're talking about a couple of gas turbine
generators online.

Pierre R. Breber

Thank you, Doug.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
My question, Mike, is, I guess, it's got a part A and B, so apologies to Jake on that. But it's kind of around
disposals. Our understanding from the Hess side is that despite the fact that you haven't filed the S-4 yet,
you haven't got the FTC yet, and I realize that those processes are ongoing, but the integration planning is
still going ahead full steam.
And I'm just curious if you can offer any color on how that process has evolved as it relates specifically
to portfolio high grading. The absence of Malaysia in your go-forward plan, for example, it seems to me a
$15 billion number might have a lot of upside. So any color you can offer on that topic, please.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Doug, it's really premature for us to comment on that until the transaction closes. Hess has a pretty
tight portfolio of assets that are performing well. And we really need to close the deal, have access to all
the data and reoptimize all of our views of portfolio investments and update our new plan. And so I don't
want to speculate on any assets.
And look, we've got some of our own assets that we do have out in the public domain already. You may
have seen reports on Kaybob Duvernay, on Congo. So there are some divestments that we have signaled
out of the Chevron portfolio.
And I think as you see the divestments unfold over the next few years because we will have more assets
in the portfolio that come from legacy Chevron, that is likely to be a greater contributor, I would guess, to
the overall $10 billion to $15 billion number than things that come in through this transaction. But I can't
comment on Malaysia or any other particular asset until we get past the close.

Joshua Ian Silverstein

Coming back to the Permian, you're stepping up the CapEx this year to about $5 billion versus $4 billion
last year to help you deliver the year-over-year growth. As you continue to ramp towards the 1 million
BOE per day target, what's needed from a CapEx standpoint to deliver this growth? Can you stay closer
to the $5 billion range? Or does that step up towards $6 billion in 2025 because you have an accelerating
pace to hit that?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. No, appreciate the question, Josh. We're starting this year with 12 rigs and 3 frac crews. I mentioned
we'll add a fourth frac crew around the middle of the year.
But at the same time, we're becoming more efficient. We need fewer rigs to drill the planned lateral feet
that we've got out in front of us. And so as we close in on 1 million barrels a day, we're at the capital level
that I think is going to be required to get us there.
And then the really nice thing about this is, when you're trying to hold the plateau as opposed to grow
from 700,000 to 800,000 to 900,000 to 1 billion -- 1 million a day, you actually can pull capital spending
down because you're offsetting decline. You're not trying to offset decline and grow by significant chunks
each year.
And so inflation has moderated, and that has been a challenge. We've talked about some of the things,
we're moving water around a little bit more, but that's embedded in our plan now going forward. So I
would not anticipate that we're going to have to go towards $6 billion in order to get there.
And as we get to each year, we'll give you an updated guide on it. But when we plateau production, capital
spending and capital discipline really matters. I just want to emphasize this. We intend to live within our
capital means and be really tight on capital. And that applies to the Permian along with every other asset.

Pierre R. Breber

Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Mike and Pierre, I think, Mike, when you first become the CEO, I think one focus is that cost matter for
you. And that over the last several years, there's a lot of acquisition and change in portfolio. So it's very
difficult for us from the outside to see where is your cost structure comparing to, let's say, before the
pandemic in 2019.
Is there any way that you can help us in terms of what is the structural cost base there for you to date
comparing to, say, a number of years ago, especially during the early part of the pandemic, you guys did
have a restructuring effort.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul, I don't have all that stuff right on the top of my head to go back to 2019. It's a fair request. But
look, I think we showed a chart in here over the last several years that our unit costs are relatively flat. In
fact, I think we're #2 on that chart. We don't break out each of the competitors.
Our unit OpEx last year was about 15 80 a barrel, which is about 5% lower than the year before. And we
still have outstanding unit OpEx reduction targets going out to 2026 at mid-cycle.
We've had some inflation along the way. But you're right, we took a lot of costs out of the business in
2020 and 2021.

Operator
We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
And thanks for everything, Pierre. Maybe this one will be a easy or a hard one for you depending on
what you're planning for. But it's about -- it's a follow-up on TCO in Kazakhstan and the affiliate dividend
guidance.
And what's interesting about it is that it's flat year-over-year with a commodity assumption that may be
a little bit lower than the prior year. And within affiliates, there's also some LNG exposure, which isn't as
strong as it was last year ex TCO.
And so I guess the question is like you've given this really robust technical update on Tengiz and where
we stand. But are we already at a point where TCO is sustaining a level of dividends that's a little bit more
stable than it was kind of at the peak of the construction process or the installation process, and we're
sort of in a progression to this pro forma very stable cash flow profile from TCO? Or is that number -- am I
reading too much into that affiliate guidance number?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Sam. Absolutely, TCO dividends are on a higher trajectory just because capital is -- has wound
down. And as we've said, when we get the incremental production from FGP, it goes even higher.
There are some puts and takes. So we talked in last year, the TCO had held some surplus cash and
released that last year. This year, they're going to have to build some cash as they head into debt
payments, which, as you recall, we co-lend. We will be receiving that.
So there are some -- there will be some timing variation. But your point around the trajectory is absolutely
right because CapEx is winding down. So this has been largely self-funded. As an affiliate company, as
CapEx goes down, there's more cash available. It does depend on commodity price assumptions.
You're right, LNG is in there and also petchem. And so those are the major drivers, a little bit of refining
are the major drivers of our affiliate dividends. So it's a roughly flat with the prior year. We'll update that
as we go along during the year.
But absolutely, TCO, we've been investing in that project for 8 years. It's going to generate a lot of cash
when it comes on next year.
And maybe, Sam, just one more point. What you're going to see, too, is because it's tricky as an affiliate,
that line, that's affiliated earnings less dividend, that's going to flip. And until you see it, it will be hard
for everyone to model it. But what has been historically aligned where affiliate earnings are higher than
dividends, you will see that flip in time as we pull out more cash out of TCO, in particular, than the
earnings than the book earnings are.

So part A and part B type of question, but really on the Permian. Mike, in your slides, you highlight that
optimized well spacing and maybe coring up where you were drilling in 2023 helped the well productivity.
At the Analyst Day, you had talked about some technologies. And I'm just curious, were any of the
improvements you saw in '23 related to those?
And then part B very quickly is you're growing almost 200,000 barrels from here until -- in the next
2 years. Last quarter, you had some infrastructure issues. What are you doing to get ahead of those
infrastructure issues that don't resurface over that time period?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Nitin, what I would say on technology, I referenced the fact that we're drilling more feet out of the
same rig fleet. We're improving on completions. And so there are a lot of small things that are contributing
to the performance that we're seeing right now.
The improved recovery technologies are in various stages of being piloted out in the field. And so to the
extent some of those pilots are in the production, they contribute. But I would say it's at the margin
because we're gathering field data to look at changes in completion and fracture techniques using gas
injection and gas lift in different ways using some different chemicals to improve flow.
So as we get those into large-scale deployment, we'll start to talk about that, and we'll help you
understand how they're contributing. But I would say right now, it's more on the drilling and completions
cycle time side that we're seeing some of these improvements. And so there's more to come.
On midstream infrastructure, the -- some of the issues that we've talked about before can be -- they can
be weather-related. They can be related to some regulatory items. They can be related to a particular
gas processing plant or gathering or offtake pipeline system. We're working all of those because your
point is well made. As a large producing asset at that scale, we need really, really reliable performance
downstream of the wells.
And we have no constraints on takeaway capacity out of the basin. So we're well positioned not just for
'24, but into '25 and '26 with ultimate takeaway capacity to access the market. But we do have a lot of
pipes, pumps, tanks and other things between the field and the market, and those things need to perform.
And that is a high priority for our operations team in the field.
As I mentioned, fourth quarter performance was very strong. And they're on this, and it's a very high
priority. We saw a little bit of weather in January, which Pierre guided to, that will have a modest impact.
But we're confident that we've got a line of sight on all the operational priorities in order to ensure that,
that market access isn't constrained.

comment on some of the changes that you've implemented to improve labor productivity over the past
several months, how it's progressing versus plan.
And in your comments, you mentioned improved scope of work in the context of FGP. I'm not sure that's
related to labor or something else. But if you could elaborate on that comment as well, that would be
great.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we have multiple contractors working on commissioning and startup. And so this is everything
from walking systems down to ensure that they've been properly inspected that we refer to as punchlist
items have been identified, which is work that still needs to be completed by contractors.
And then you get into the loop checks and equipment runs and all the work to bring pieces of equipment
up into service. So we've got a number of contractors working on this. We've moved scope from
contractors that have had lower productivity to those that have exhibited higher productivity.
We've brought in additional resources to beef up the overall capacity. And on the resources or the
contractors that have lower productivity, we've worked with them to understand where are the constraints
in the bottlenecks.
And we've seen one who had a productivity factor as we measure it that was down in the kind of 0.4 range
previously is up above 0.7 now, and we're targeting to get that up again by a similar quantum. So there's
a lot of work on the ground to be sure we got the right people working on the right things so we have
enough contract resources there that we're also bringing in technical resources as we discover items that
need more technical solutions. And that can include company people or vendor people, and we're out
much further ahead.
Last quarter or the quarter before, the walk downs and other identification of issues was a few short
weeks ahead of the crews that were actually doing this work. We're several weeks now, 7, 8 or more
weeks out ahead of the teams that are doing the work.
So you've got a much better ability to plan and execute the work in a much more efficient manner
because you've got some time to put the work 33:30 back together, get the permitting done, be sure that
you've got all the right tools, equipment, et cetera.
So it's a great, big project, Devin. It's the largest brownfield project and most complex brownfield project
I've seen in my life. And we're seeing good improvements in terms of the on-the-ground performance out
of our team and out of all the contractor teams that are working on this.

provided, particularly for the Delaware at the 2023 Capital Markets Day when you forecasted a large
improvement in productivity. Can you just talk about if your type curves, particularly in the Delaware
Basin, ended up in line with where you anticipated them being as shown in that Capital Markets Day type
curve?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So I'll quickly just touch on the Midland Basin, where we continue to be a first quartile performer,
steady consistent performance. We understand the geology. There's less fluid complexity. And so we're a
top quartile, first quartile performer there in the Midland.
In the Delaware, we last year showed actual data on a Delaware-wide basis. And then we showed some
forward guidance, particularly focused on New Mexico because we were shifting so much of our program
into New Mexico, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a more productive portion of the basin.
And in the Delaware, New Mexico we saw a significant improvement with our second half POPs last year.
More than 80% of our POPs were in the second half in these more productive areas, and the subsurface
performance there has been very strong. In the appendix, we've got a slide that shows you 49 out of the
59 POPs were in the second half. And you can see that they lay right on the type curve.
And then you can see the improvement in the Delaware Basin, Texas, which we didn't guide to last year
because it was in that combined chart there. But we've seen strong improvement. We've updated our well
spacing and completion designs there.
And within the basin, there are subbasins, and some of those are performing exceptionally strong as well.
So we're seeing performance that is very consistent with what we outlined in the Markets Day last year.
I think the shift in basis was just to provide you a little bit more detail into these sub basis, and we'll
continue to report on that basis going forward.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And just as a reminder, too, Jason, so last year's performance in New Mexico, it wasn't impacted by long-
sitting DUC. So the year-on-year is bang on. It's consistent with the said guidance, and you see the
improvement in Texas because there was the impact from long-sitting DUCs in the prior year.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jeoffrey Lambujon with TPH & Co.
Jeoffrey Restituto Lambujon
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to follow up actually on the Permian and specifically ask on the program this year. What kind of
opportunity do you see from here for further improvements to spacing and completion design, cycle times
if any, in the Texas, Delaware region?
And could -- what's working well there translate to New Mexico to make those wells even stronger, quicker
to jump and complete or even to the Midland side? And then secondly, how are you all thinking about the
mix of capital allocation across these regions within the Permian throughout this year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we're constantly looking to learn and improve. And as I mentioned earlier, we've seen significant
improvement in drilling time, completion time, time for completion to POP this year. And these are a lot
of little things, right. This is -- as you continue doing things, you find more and more efficiencies. We can
bring more technology to bear, et cetera.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024
So -- and we look to extend those learnings across the basin, and frankly, between basins. So into the DJ
Basin and from the DJ Basin down to the Permian. There are differences in the sub basins that you have to
understand and respect.
But I mean, the short answer is yes. We are looking for ways to transfer learnings across there. And
every time I think we're probably at the plateau in terms of productivity improvement, smart people find
ways to continue to get even better at this. And so I don't think we've seen the end of the performance
improvement cycle.
Our overall capital allocation into the basin is largely a function of where our portfolio lies. About 25% is
in the Midland Basin, 25% is in the Delaware New Mexico portion of the basin and then the balance, about
50%, is in Delaware Texas. It's been that way here. This past year and going forward, that's a pretty good
way to approximate it.
Operator
We'll go next to John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And congratulations to Pierre. I'm going to give you guys a break on TCO and the Permian. I'm going to
ask a question on the DJ. So just looking at this growth of 125 kbd for '24, how should we think about that
growth off of a pro forma '23 basis? Just trying to understand what's kind of the underlying real growth
rate in the DJ. And then if you could just update us with a couple of quarters behind you now post PDC on
your broader plans for development in the DJ.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we've now got a -- fourth quarter is the first full quarter with PDC. The third quarter, we had 2
months out of the 3 with PDC in there. And you can see we came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit over
400,000 barrels a day, which is, our plans are to hold the DJ around 400,000 barrels a day going forward
in a highly efficient factory.
And the fourth quarter was maybe even a little stronger than we might have expected. There wasn't
as much weather-related downtime in November and December. And then there were some accounting
adjustments that were booked into the fourth quarter that were not really related in operations.
So the above 400 is there's a few things contributing to that, that probably are not repeating or going to
pull back a little bit. But we're confident we can hold around 400,000 barrels a day.
We're still executing the well design and well spacing that was in the PDC basis of design, which is a little
bit different than ours, a little -- a few more wells and tighter spacing and driven more to drive volume.
Our basis of design is more focused on return on invested capital. And so it's wider spacing, it's bigger
fracs, but it's less capital overall and higher return.
And so as we transition to a standardized -- more standardized basis design across the basin, you'll see
that roll into the numbers. We've got 4 rigs that are going. We've got permits out for multiple years,
nearly to the end of the decade. And so we're very, very pleased, and we're learning things, I got to tell
you.
There's some stuff that we've learned from PDC that will apply not only in the rest of the DJ, but it's going
to apply in the Permian as well that's going to help us. So going forward, these are high cash margin, low
breakeven barrels.
We plan to hold it at a plateau around 400. And we've -- synergies are on track there. We've got virtually
all the CapEx synergies are essentially in the bag. We're already down to $1 billion there.

Operator
We'll go next to Lucas Herrmann with BNP Paribas.
Lucas Oliver Herrmann
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
Yes. And Pierre, I'll add my kind of comments to the host already. But thank you for all the insights. It's
always been worth listening to.
When I look at the growth that you're likely to see in oil in particular over the next 2 to 3 years, I mean,
it feels as though you're going to be adding towards 0.5 million, maybe slightly more barrels of pretty
high-margin black oil. And I guess the question is about whiplash and this increased sensitivity that the
business is going to have to movements in volatile commodity.
And what you feel, Pierre, might that implies the balance sheet and the way you think about balance
sheet and managing things. And just if I could add on, could you just give me an idea of what the loan
repayment schedule looks like at TCO. And I presume that loan repayments will go through the net in, the
net out line in -- on the CapEx side or the investment side of the equation or do they play elsewhere?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Right. No, thanks, Lucas. I'll take it. We've been overweighed upstream and overweighed oil liquids for a
long time. And you're right, recent acquisitions and Hess certainly adds to that, and we like that exposure.
In terms of how we manage the balance sheet, I mean, the first thing is we start with our breakeven. So
what it takes -- the oil price it takes to cover our CapEx and dividends, that was in the low 50s last year.
And so we see mostly upside. And that's why we had record share buybacks last year, almost $15 billion,
5% of our shares outstanding because we're built for a price well below where we currently are.
We've also done it while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our net debt ratio is 7%. We've said as we
keep our share repurchases steady across the cycle that we're okay relevering back up towards the low
end of our guidance range, which is 20% to 25%.
So that guidance, that's a kind of through the cycle net debt ratio guidance, that still holds. And if we had
a significant change in the portfolio, of course, we would look at that or even we would look at that going
forward.
But I think the actions that we're taking are consistent with that guidance. And again, adding that
exposure when you're built at the breakeven -- when we think about our balance sheet, you take into
account lots of things, your portfolio, the commodity price outlook, but your breakeven is really key.
And Mike was talking about capital and cost discipline, our ability to fund our reinvestment program in
both traditional and new energies and grow the company and pay a growing dividend, right, twice -- more
than twice our nearest peer, greater than S&P 500. We just increased at 8%. So all those numbers are
before the latest increase.
We can do all that at a low price, return surplus cash, that's how we're going to think about it. So again,
you should expect our net debt to increase over time depending on commodity prices and how we've
returned cash to shareholders. I would not -- having more exposure to high-margin barrels, as you say,
that's a good thing. We're built for it. And as long as we keep our breakeven low and below where prices
are trading, we're in a really good spot.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Oh, yes. So TCO loan payments -- sorry about that. Yes, because I alluded to that, that will not be in cash
from ops. That shows up in our investing cash. So Jake and the team will take you all through that.
But yes, what I was saying about that affiliate line flipping, that's separate from this. In a different line,
we will see cash being returned. And it's $1 billion our share next year. Again, $22 billion in '26 and then
in '28 or '30. So all that's disclosed in our 10-K. Jake, can take you through that. But yes, that's only
additional. And again, we shouldn't be surprised. We've been investing for 8 years in this project. That
cash is going to come back once the project starts out.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe Generale.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
And Pierre, all the best for the next chapter. My question is on Henry Hub. In the new sensitivities you
published today, you saw a very material 30% increase in your Henry Hub sensitivity. Is this purely
because of PDC? And related to that, on a macro level, if you can perhaps share your views on the 2024
outlook for Henry Hub, please?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
So I'll start, Irene, and then Mike can take the macro. Yes, it's a function of PDC certainly and then just
continued -- the associated gas that comes along with the Permian. So as we're growing that, it obviously
comes along with natural gas.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. And Irene, the macro I was pulling up the slide on the Henry Hub sensitivity. So broadly speaking,
oil markets are pretty balanced right now. I think the geopolitics are the thing that are harder to call and
could drive movements one way or the other. It could be OPEC+ decisions, can be this conflict in the
Middle East. Economic growth in the world continues to be decent, and our outlook on demand growth for
all this year is maybe not quite as strong as last year, but still growing.
Gas is a little bit different. The inventories are high in the U.S. Inventories are high in Europe. We're kind
of mostly through the winter time, certainly through the riskiest period of the winter time. And now there's
questions that are not going to really weigh on the market in the near term, but maybe longer term about
exports out of the U.S.
And so all of that has got gas markets under a little more pressure than oil markets or refined products.
And it's not unusual. Pierre was just talking about how we build the company to compete through the
cycles and different parts of the portfolio basket.
Petrochemicals are under some pressure right now as well. And so at any point in time, we're going to find
some of the fundamentals probably under pressure. Others are looking pretty good. And here in the short
term, I think Henry Hub is in the under pressure category.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024
If I look at the production guide of 4% to 7% growth on, say, 3.1 million, and I try to book end that
between a fourth quarter closer to 3 4 and 2025, where we're going to see TCO FGP startup plus hitting
that 1 million-barrel a day milestone in the Permian sort of implies there's an inflection point in production
growth coming at some point or perhaps there's a conservative guide for this year. Is that the right way to
think about it?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, coming into this year, we now have a full year of PDC that will be part of the portfolio. So that's
pretty safe in terms of counting on that. I've already mentioned that fourth quarter was a little bit higher
than maybe we even might have expected because we had high reliability.
Some of these midstream issues we had faced in the Permian had -- didn't repeat. We have this
accounting catch-up thing in the Permian as well. And we had a pretty light turnaround schedule in the
fourth quarter. So it was a strong quarter all the way around.
As we head into next year, we've got some asset sales in the guidance. And Bob, we've been at the low
end -- we've kind of ended up last couple of years hitting our guidance range but at the low end. And so
I think you could probably think of us as being a little more comfortable in the middle of the range this
year, given a number of other things that you mentioned. So we try to give you guidance each year that
we expect to hit, and we certainly expect to hit it this year.
Operator
We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
And my question, Mike, is maybe just on the shareholder return specifically. Trying to get a sense of -- it
sounds like you will, but just want to get a sense if you'll continue paying out majority of free cash flow for
the remainder of this year. And if the buybacks will continue to constitute a bit over 50% of that payout.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Neal, we have not used some percentage or range of percentage of cash from operations as kind of a
go-buy for distributions. What we've done is have leaned on our track record on the dividend, first of all.
And we've already clarified what you can expect this year with the 8% increase that we've announced.
And then I would point you back towards our upside and downside guidance that we've had out there now
for a number of years. $10 billion to $20 billion on the range for buybacks. And that's in an upside price
case, we'd be up towards the higher end of that, in a lower price case, down at the lower end, both of
which we can comfortably handle.
We have indicated that post the Hess close, all other things equal, we'll see when it happens and how the
world looks when we get there. But we would expect to move from a rate of 17.5 to the top end of 20
because we're so confident in the long-term cash productive capacity of our portfolio and the strength of
our balance sheet.
So rather than focusing in on those percentages, I'd really point you towards the specific guidance that
we've issued in the kind of the track record. Now -- and of course, I think Pierre mentioned this in his
comments, we do remain under SEC restrictions right now relative to the rate at which we can buy back
and then look out of the market when the Hess proxy is open. And so all of these things are -- under
normal times, we don't have one of those constraints on us.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2023 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 02, 2024
And I would just add -- let me just add a little bit. It's fitting maybe my last words will be on share
buybacks. 6 straight years of buyback, right. 17 out of the past 21 years, but we actually bought back
more shares last year than the year before, even though earnings and cash flow were higher, right. There
were records in '22, still strong in '23.
That's the whole point. We're trying to be steady across the commodity cycle. We've heard from investors
that buybacks should not be procyclical. And it's hard to be countercyclical in the commodity business that
has some price volatility.
So being steady across the cycle is how we guide to it. And these formulas, in fact, reinforce the opposite.
They reinforce procyclicality. So we're giving a return that, in some ways, is almost independent in prices
within a range because we're -- could have paid more out in '22, but we held it back. And we used some
of that to pay in '23. We'll see where it goes, but the intent is to try to be steady across the cycle, either
procyclical or countercyclical.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.
Jake Robert Spiering
Director
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre
Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available
on Chevron's website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Jake. I want to start by acknowledging the tragic events in the Middle East. We're deeply
saddened by the loss of life, and our hearts go out to those affected by the war. We continue to prioritize
the safety and well-being of our employees and their families and the safe delivery of natural gas.
Earlier this week, we announced that Chevron entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hess
Corporation. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2024. And we look forward to providing
updates in the future.
Now turning to the third quarter. We continued to make progress on our objective to safely deliver higher
returns and lower carbon by returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the sixth consecutive
quarter and delivering ROCE greater than 12% for the ninth consecutive quarter; and investing in
traditional energy by closing the PDC Energy acquisition and in new energies by acquiring a majority stake
in a green hydrogen production and storage hub in Utah.
And earlier this month, we released our Climate Change Resilience Report, which details our approach,
actions and progress in reducing carbon intensity and growing new, lower carbon businesses. I encourage
everyone to read the report available on chevron.com.
At TCO, base business continues to deliver good results. The planned turnaround was completed ahead of
schedule. The reservoir is performing well and the plant remains full. We expect a higher dividend in the
fourth quarter.
TCO has achieved mechanical completion at the Future Growth Project. Following slower-than-expected
commissioning progress, we conducted an independent cost and schedule review. We now forecast the
Wellhead Pressure Management Project, which is the field conversion from high pressure to low pressure,
to begin startup in the first half of 2024 and to continue through 2 major train turnarounds. FGP is
expected to start up in the first half of 2025 and ramp to full production within 3 months. Total project
cost is expected to increase between 3% and 5%.
TCO production on a 100% basis in 2024 is forecasted to be about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
lower than 2023 due to a heavier turnaround schedule and planned downtime for WPMP conversions. TCO
is expected to reach greater than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2025 when FGP fully ramps
up.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
Free cash flow from TCO in 2025 is expected to be more than $4 billion. Chevron's share at $60 Brent,
down about $1 billion from our prior estimate. Our focus remains on safe and reliable commissioning and
start-up.
I'll now turn it over to Pierre to discuss the financials.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We delivered another quarter with strong earnings, cash flow and ROCE. This quarter's
results included 2 special items: a one-time tax benefit of $560 million in Nigeria and pension settlement
costs of $40 million. Foreign currency benefits were $285 million. The appendix of this presentation
contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
Organic CapEx this quarter included about $200 million for PDC legacy operations after closing in August.
Our balance sheet remains strong, ending the quarter with a net debt ratio in the single digits.
Another quarter of solid cash flow enabled us to deliver on all of our financial priorities. Despite restrictions
during the PDC transaction, we were able to repurchase well over $3 billion in Chevron shares. Cash used
to reduce debt was primarily related to PDC's higher cost borrowing. Cash balances ended the quarter
near $6 billion, a little above what's needed to run our businesses.
Adjusted third quarter earnings were down $5.1 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted
upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and negative timing effects. Higher unfavorable
discrete tax charges and exploration expenses were partly offset by lower DD&A, Venezuela cash
recoveries and other favorable items. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to a
negative swing in timing effects and lower marketing margins.
Compared with the last quarter, adjusted earnings were down just over $50 million. Adjusted upstream
earnings were roughly flat as higher prices and volumes were offset by unfavorable discrete tax charges
and negative timing effects due to the rise in prices. DD&A and OpEx were both higher in part due to the
addition of PDC legacy assets for 2 months in the quarter.
Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by
unfavorable timing effects. All other was down on unfavorable tax items and decreased interest income in
line with lower cash balances.
Third quarter oil equivalent production was up 6% over last quarter primarily due to 2 months of legacy
PDC production. This was partly offset by a planned turnaround at TCO and pit stop at Gorgon. The
Permian, excluding legacy PDC, was down 2% due to lower non-operated production. Company-operated
production was flat with the second quarter.
Now looking ahead, our fourth quarter estimate for turnarounds and downtime includes approximately
30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for Tamar. We anticipate affiliate dividends in the fourth quarter to
be largely from TCO. As a reminder, we record a 15% withholding tax on TCO dividends.
Due to the pending transaction with Hess, share repurchases will be restricted pursuant to SEC
regulations. Chevron expects share repurchases in the fourth quarter to be around $3 billion, plus or
minus 20%, depending primarily on the timing of the Hess definitive proxy statement mailing.
In summary, our actions and performance show that Chevron keeps delivering strong results. With a
strategy that remains clear and consistent, we're well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in
any environment.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jake.
Jake Robert Spiering
Director

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I was hoping we could dig into the international upstream, just a little short on what we were expecting
this quarter, what some of the factors were, other than the ones called out, the FX issue and the tax
benefit in Nigeria.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Roger. Look, I'll let Pierre cover this in a little more detail, but there's -- I recognize this quarter was
a tough one to model. And there's pretty material or significant noncash charges. Timing effects, primarily
inventory costs, we see with rising prices some tax reserves and charges for legal abandonment and other
things and then some lower realizations with are mix and the lag effect in some of our LNG pricing.
On timing and inventory costs in particular, on period-to-period comparisons where we had a prior period,
whether it was last quarter or the same quarter last year, where prices were coming down and then in
the current period, we see prices strengthening significantly, you really get pretty significant deltas on
the way we cost inventory. And if you go back to the, I think, the first quarter of '22, we had some similar
dynamics.
So anyway, that's kind of high level on it. Pierre, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the upstream
and international upstream in particular.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, it's a subset of what you talked to, Mike, Roger. So timing effects, the largest timing effects this
quarter were on cargoes on the water. So you'll see that primarily in the international upstream,
international downstream. Timing effects are in 3 buckets. You have paper mark-to-market, you have on-
the-water inventory and then you have on-land inventory.
So it's really cargoes on the water that drive most of the effect, cargoes that are in transit and cross over
quarterly periods. And so that's what -- the trajectory of prices, as Mike indicated, is really what drives
that. Mike talked about abandonment estimate. So those will show up in depreciation. And we saw that in
the international upstream.
And then in LNG, you see some lag pricing. We also saw some mix between contract cargoes and spot
cargoes on LNG. And on the liquid side, we saw some mix effects. So it's a bit of where the liftings are
relative to production in terms of tax jurisdictions, the types of products, how they trade in terms of
discounts to Brent. So there were a number of items in international upstream. And you could follow up,
Roger, with Jake and cover any more details.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I'll sum it up as messy. I appreciate it.
Michael K. Wirth

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
We'll take our next question from Josh Silverstein with UBS.
Joshua Ian Silverstein
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
On the TCO, you had mentioned that in 2025, you expect the cash flow to be about $1 billion lower,
around $4 billion versus $5 billion previously. Is that just due to the project delays? Or is there higher
cost estimates now in that, so it would be lower distributions from there? Or is there something else that's
driving that?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So Josh, there's going to be some more capital, we said 3% to 5%. So think about around $1 billion
Chevron share over '24 and '25, probably a little more weighted to '24 than '25. Cash flow from the
operations will be lower by about $1.5 billion at $60 Brent in total over the next 2 years really due to the
delay in the project. So it's equivalent to about 50,000 barrels a day in net production in each of those
years.
So in total, we expect our share of dividends to be lower by about $2.5 billion across '24 and '25 from the
prior guidance. And so it's a combination of those things. And so we had previously guided to above $5
billion. We're now saying above $4 billion and a little more of that coming from production and cash flow
from ops as opposed to CapEx.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And the delay in WPMP doesn't have any impact really because there was no incremental production. So
the effects that Mike was talking about in production are really from the delay in the start-up of FGP, which
obviously adds incremental production.
Operator
We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I just want to stay on the TCO question. As you think about, Mike, the biggest gating factors to getting
from here to completion around FGP, just walk us through the landscape and the key milestones that you'll
be watching and we should be watching to give us conviction that the project is coming into service.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the main message here, Neil, is as we completed both WPMP and then mechanical completion of
FGP and we've begun to get deep into the commissioning, we've, I think, previously mentioned we worked
with some technical issues with our utility systems. And as we did that and we saw some of these impacts,
we commissioned an independent cost and schedule review off cycle. We normally do these annually, but
we didn't want to wait.
And so as we saw some of this evidence that things were going slower, there were some more discovery
work, we sent in an independent team to give us kind of a cold eyes assessment on cost and schedule.
And I think the main thing that I would distill that down to is the recommendations from that and that are
embedded in our updated guidance today reflect a more conservative forecast of commissioning progress.
And so we're assuming things will take longer than the prior plan.
We're assuming we're going to have discovery items that tend to come up in complex projects like this.
And in response, we've implemented some significant changes in terms of how we're approaching this.
We've moved contract resources over from 3GI, which is a portion of the Future Growth Project, which is

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
now completed and fully commissioned over onto the other commissioning work. So we've added contract
resources there.
We brought in experienced turnaround and operations people that are very skilled in the discovery work,
in managing through the restart of and operations of facilities now to help us with this. And then we've
also added technical resources to address any unplanned discovery items that would come up.
So we've had a significant change in our approach to this. We've got a more conservative guidance here
that we're issuing now. And we'll continue to talk about this every quarter.
I guess, the main things to look at here are we've got big compressor trains that will start up for pressure
boost, which is a key driver of this high-pressure to low-pressure conversion. These are very large
machines. And so those are key milestones. After that, we've got metering stations that are converted
from high pressure or low pressure.
And so over the next few quarters -- and there's, I think, 40-some-odd metering stations as you go out
through the entire field. We've got these 2 big turnarounds that I've talked about. All of those are really
key milestones that we'll be tracking very closely. And we'll update you on those as we go forward.
Operator
We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I wanted to just stick with upstream but actually ask about Venezuela. You've had some increase in
production year-over-year, given the initial sanction relief. And there's obviously been some additional
sanction relief announced just since the last quarterly call. I think you might have been on an interview
this morning. You made some comments that you could see a sequential increase in production between
now and year-end.
I was wondering if you could just step back, talk through what impact this sanction relief has on your
production profile and also willingness to invest in that region. And can you remind us how impactful
Venezuela volumes are for your corporate cash flow?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So yes, we have seen some action now from the U.S. government. We had been previously
operating under an OFAC license, which was modified at the beginning of this year, a general license.
There's some specific licenses that go with that, that define the terms under which we can operate.
The recent action in the new general license issued by OFAC really kind of opens up operating room for
others more so than it does for us. We already -- it doesn't materially change our circumstances here.
And so I think what you'll see is some more people lifting crude, bring it to the -- you'll see more crude
flow to the U.S. I don't think -- the impact on our operations really is not particularly significant. We are
up to something around 130,000 barrels a day from maybe 60,000 barrels a day earlier this year. We still
think we can get to 150,000 or so by year-end. So we are seeing improvements and expect there's some
more that we can see through the balance of the year.
And that's driving -- the cash from that is going to pay legitimate operating expenses, tax and royalties,
recover some past-dues that we are owed. And we're really working on what I would call pretty
straightforward field maintenance and things to restore production that aren't particularly long cycle or
capital-intensive and staying within the kind of cash that's being generated from those sales in order to
fund that.
I would expect that's the posture we'll remain in for a while here until we see how the longer-term
sanctions environment plays out, the political situation in the country with elections and the like and

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
continue to make progress on recovery of the past dues that I mentioned. And so not a lot of change,
I guess, I would say, from our point of view. Pierre, maybe you want to comment on the cash and
production.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Consistent with what Mike just said, we're continuing to do cost affiliate accounting, which means
we are not -- we don't record production or reserves, right? So that's not reflected in our numbers. And
we only record earnings when we receive cash. So we're not -- we're recording a proportionate share of
equity earnings but only what we actually receive in cash. And that's something that we'll continue to look
at.
And as Mike said, depending on all those potential triggers down the road, elections and such, we could go
back to equity accounting at some point in time. But we have not made that decision yet.
In terms of cash flow, it's about 1% of our cash flow. So it's modest, of course. But it's more than it was
before. And so as Mike said, operations there are continuing well. And we're getting a little bit of cash. And
we'll just see where it goes from here.
Operator
We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I'm sure you get a few more on [ TCO ]. I just want to ask about the Permian. Last quarter, you gave
some very helpful data points on well productivity this year. I was wondering, particularly for the New
Mexico side, if you had any incremental comments for wells driven in the third quarter. Because I know
it was a pretty small sample size of POPs in the first half of the year. So any comments there would be
helpful.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. And I might give you some kind of broader commentary on Permian performance as well. Overall,
production was down just a little bit, about 2% in the quarter. That was entirely driven by non-operated
joint ventures. And primarily, a couple of the operators had delays in putting wells online due to frac
hits and some other factors. There was also some takeaway capacity on the Permian highway that --
constraints that resulted in some unplanned downtime.
So co-op production in the third quarter was essentially flat from the prior quarter, which is what we had
guided to. And that's despite having some wells that were choked back due to some surface constraints.
In one development area, we're seeing higher-than-expected CO2 content in the gas and others in the
area are as well. So we've got third-party handling and process facilities that are constrained by that and
can't handle all the CO2. So we're choking wells back.
There's a new federal regulation that I won't get into the details. But it affects how we meter production.
And it prevents co-mingling. And so we've got wells choked back until we can get some new meters
in place. And then we've got some produced water limits that have come into effect in some areas. So
there's a number of things that are not indicative of well performance, but other surface realities that
we're working our way through that are impacting co-op production a little bit.
In New Mexico, you're right. We got more POPs in the second half of the year. We've POP-ed about 60%
of the planned wells in New Mexico. So the balance, almost half, come on in the fourth quarter. POP
performance has generally been strong. Some of those wells are hit by the facility constraints that I've
talked about.

But overall, well performance is aligned with our type curve expectations. I think when we get to the
fourth quarter call, Biraj, we'll come back with some more detail on type curves. We'll have enough of
them online. We'll have enough months that we can start to give you some of the same kind of evidence
that we did last quarter to show you the performance.

We'll go next to Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Maybe we'll stick with the U.S. and ask about just the U.S. upstream CapEx number. There's a lot of
moving parts in here. You've got incorporation of PDC. You have kind of GOM projects and Ballymore
coming into play, inflation and then timing effects that you alluded to.
I guess, when you think about this quarter's U.S. upstream capital, how would you characterize it just
overall? Would you say it's sort of on plan or like overly influenced by any one of these factors that may or
may not be mitigated over time?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Sam, you're right. I mean, we are seeing pressure in the U.S. And I think we're probably going to
end up higher than our budget as we end the year. PDC is being integrated into the factory pretty much as
we expected. And so it's an increment because it wasn't in our original plan. But it's really not a driver of
this. The big thing is we're seeing actually more feet drilled per rig and more completion feet than we had
planned.
And so the productivity of the primary development activity has continued to improve. But that means we
spend more money on tubulars, on sand, on water than we had anticipated. So it's kind of a good news,
but it brings with it some costs. We've got some long lead items, where we're seeing supply chain realities
that say we need to place long lead orders earlier. So some things we otherwise would have ordered next
year that we've actually moved ordering and initial payments on into this year. So there's some long lead
dynamics going on.
And then I mentioned earlier, produced water is becoming an issue, the reinjection of that and doing that
in a way that minimizes the incidences of induced seismicity. So we've got some more produced water
handling infrastructure spend.
So I would say those are kind of the primary drivers. And that's pushing the Permian to be a little hot. Gulf
of Mexico is pretty well right on plan. And so what you're seeing there is really a function of PDC, which
is just an increment that's been added, and then some additional costs in the Permian program that we
really hadn't anticipated as we went into the year.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And I'll just add. So if you take out inorganic, which is $600 million year-to-date, $400 million in the third
quarter for -- primarily for ACES and the $200 million that we had for PDC in the third quarter, through
third quarter year-to-date, we're about $200 million above the ratable budget. Of course, fourth quarter
tends to be higher. So as Mike says, we'll likely end the year a little bit above budget.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
Can I go back to TCO? It's a little bit of the late stage for the cost increase and everything. I guess,
the question is that, I mean, what have we learned from this process to ensure that your future project
execution will become better and not facing the entire problem there?
I mean, it has been a challenging project all along due to a number of different reasons. But quite frankly,
that is a bit disappointing at this very last stage for the bit of the slip in the schedule and also the cost
increase.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul, thank you. And look, I share the sentiment. So I understand where you're coming from.
Big complex projects, you've been along for the whole ride. So you know early on, there were some
engineering issues that we confronted and addressed. In the middle of it, the big thing was the pandemic
and demobilizing, remobilizing, building medical facilities and a whole bunch of stuff that we had to
manage our way through and was complex and difficult. And our folks did a great job, but it clearly
impacted cost and schedule.
And the big thing here, Paul, is as we've gotten into -- and you have to remember, this is -- we're redoing
the power infrastructure for the entire field, which is, geographically speaking, it's an enormous space.
And this is infrastructure, frankly, that goes back a lot of it to kind of Soviet days. So there's an entire new
power distribution system. We're taking the entire field and taking it from high-pressure production to
lower pressure in the WPMP process and then building the really large sour gas injection and incremental
production facilities.
And it's -- so it's almost a field-wide refurbishment of a lot of it and then this big increment of production.
And the commissioning of that is incredibly complex. And as we went in and did this cost and schedule
review early in -- relatively early in the commissioning process, based on what we were seeing, what
became evident is that we need to account for that complexity in our schedule. And I don't think it was
fully reflected in the schedule. And in a big, complex project like this, you find things. And early on, we
found challenges in the utility system. And it cost us some time. And it -- that ripples through.
And so the guidance we're giving you now is really what I would say is it's more conservative because it
assumes that those kinds of things are going to be encountered for the balance of the project. And we
need to set expectations that those are the realities that we're going to be dealing with. And so that's why
the schedule, it's all in commissioning. It's -- bulk construction is completed. All the equipment is there.
And this really is the final commissioning process. If we do well, we could end up on the front end of those
windows that I gave you.
But we've given you those because our experience says we should not plan for that, we had to plan for
the reality of these things. And as I mentioned in response to the earlier question by Neil, we've added
incremental resources in multiple areas now, ought to be -- to anticipate and be prepared for these kinds
of challenges.
And so I think the lesson is on the projects like this, of which there are a few, in the future, our
commissioning plans will reflect that complexity more completely than the commissioning plans did on this
one.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And I'll just add some comments on affiliate dividends. So we've given a guide on fourth quarter affiliate
dividends, which falls short of the full year guide that we did at the start of the year. That shortfall is not
from TCO, that's from CPChem, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, on lower petchem margins. It's also
from Angola LNG on lower TTF prices than we had assumed. We've also had some of the Angola LNG cash
has come back to us as return to capital.
In terms of TCO, we had a $600 million dividend Chevron share in the second quarter. We can't get ahead
of the TCO Board on the fourth quarter. But 90% or so of the fourth quarter guide is related TCO. I'll

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
remind you last year that TCO dividend was $1.6 billion Chevron share. All these numbers are before the
withholding tax. So we'll see a pretty significant increase in the total year TCO dividend. Now some of that
was the -- getting some of the excess cash off the balance sheet like we were talking about.
But if you go back to the period prior to the start of this construction, so the period into 2015, we're
seeing dividends now -- or this year's dividend will be similar to what we saw from that time period. So
the inflection is happening after 5 years of either not receiving dividends or, in fact, putting cash out,
essentially having negative free cash flow.
So we know production is going to be down next year. We showed that. So you'd expect dividends to
reflect that a little bit. We have a little bit of increase in CapEx. And then we'll be heading to this more
than $4 billion in '25. And all of that is -- that guidance is at $60.
So we're seeing some positive news in terms of the cash flow coming out. Clearly disappointing news on
the revised schedule, but we're going to work hard to deliver it in the front end of the range.

So I have a follow-up on the Permian ex PDC. You were down 2% in 3Q, including the non-op piece, and
really helpful color there from Mike on Biraj's question. But just -- it does leave a pretty big jump to hit
guidance in 4Q, around 10%, if I calculated right.
So are you sticking with that 770,000 guide for the legacy piece? And if not, is there a good way to think
about 4Q production in general?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, John, we're not changing the guidance. Overall on production, excluding PDC, we expect to be the
lower end of overall guidance. Permian production is expected to ramp up in the fourth quarter. Full year
production expected around 770,000, 780,000 or so if you include PDC. And so yes, the guidance is still
intact for the Permian. Go ahead, Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Mike talked about the 2% shortfall on non-op, which averages to about 0.5%. He talked about also
some of these surface constraints. So we have worked to overcome the shortfall we saw in non-op in the
third quarter to deliver that.
So no change in guidance. But clearly, we have a little more work to do in the fourth quarter to achieve it.
We do expect though fourth quarter, more POPs and more production, in line with the plan that we laid out
earlier this year.

forward? You've got a lot of things in the queue through 2027. Why should the market be comfortable that
you can execute on that time line with what you have in your portfolio?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Doug, you're right. I think there has been a reaction apparently in the market this morning to
this. We've spent a lot of time -- I'll go back to Jay Johnson spending time not only in these calls but on
traveling around, talking about what we're doing on capital project execution. This is a unique project. And
I won't repeat the things that I went through earlier with Paul. But this is a large, multiyear effort that had
supply chains coming in from all the way around the world through the Russian inland waterway system
through the pandemic. And we've had our challenges with it.
There are not projects in our queue that are remotely similar to this one. The kinds of things that we're
talking about now are factory development projects across multiple shale basins. They're deepwater
developments that I think the track record on those is quite different. And so I think the lessons on these
really complex capital projects are that despite employing the best engineering and construction firms in
the world, bringing in partners that have strong capability, they are really complex and challenging.
And part of the way we mitigate that is we'd be very selective about the ones we do. We walked away
from the Kitimat LNG project because we -- despite a lot of efforts to make that project better, we had
concerns about execution in that kind of an environment and ultimately said we're not going to take on a
project like that, particularly at this point in time.
And so part of it is the way you choose what you do. Part of it is continuing to learn and apply those
learnings, many of which from a decade ago have been implemented into the TCO project. But some of
which from the TCO project will be implemented and integrated into other projects that go forward of
similar complexity.
So look, we're close to the finish line on this thing. And we've got a full-court press on it to make sure that
the commissioning is safe and reliable and we have a clean start-up. And the lessons from that will be
applied in every other project that we do.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And I'll just restate the impact that Mike -- yes, thanks, Doug. And I'll just restate the impact that Mike
talked about. It's $2.5 billion, that's at $60, that's less than $1.50 a share. So clearly, they were down a
lot more than that. We talked about the earnings in this. We know that weighs also on the shares, at the
same time, noncash items, timing effects that reverse and discrete items that are nonrecurring.
So we feel good about the company's performance in the quarter in terms of how we operated safely and
reliably, how we captured margin. We know, as Mike said earlier, we have these quarters where it can be
messy, can be noisy. It's one of them. But the underlying company is very strong and healthy.

Yes, Irene, the -- so I think that the reference was simply these are additive to -- versus prior periods.
And so I wouldn't want anybody to interpret that somehow they were different than what we expected
because the OpEx and the DD&A are not different than what we expected.
Synergy capture is good. We're right on track to capture all of the synergies. No change to the guidance.
We're confident that there's upside. And we'll realize that over time as we have on other transactions. We
think there's additional operational midstream and procurement synergies that we didn't build into our
initial target. And the CapEx synergy has been captured as well.
So the nice thing about this in a quarter, where I appreciate Doug's view that maybe the reaction here has
been a little -- we closed the transaction 5 months ahead of guidance. We pick up additional production for
a bigger part of the year, the earnings and cash flow that go along with that. We've already paid off some
high-cost debt. And so we're integrating that into our business now. And it's a very sound transaction that
is going to deliver, I think, everything that we expected and then some.

I wanted to ask about what's going on in your Middle East footprint. You've obviously had to take Tamar
offline. I believe that's a fixed price asset that you're receiving, so probably not a large cash impact. But
if you could remind us what the cash impact is and the ability to maybe reroute that gas somewhere else
or offset those losses, and then how you think about the Eastern Mediterranean growth profile overall, if
there's any change how you're thinking about it in light of the recent events over there.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I'll take the second part of that and then ask Pierre to address the cash and production impact.
It doesn't change our view on the development opportunities really at all, Jason. This is a long-term
play. It's a very, very large gas resource. We like some of the follow-on exploration opportunities in the
region. We're working on the Aphrodite field in the waters offshore Cyprus to develop. We're working
expansion projects that have been sanctioned on both Tamar and Leviathan and further expansion ideas
on Leviathan.
And so we've got to take a long-term view, which is measured in years and decades. And when you have
things in the short term that create the circumstances that we see right now, we have to be prepared to
mitigate those risks and to keep people safe and maintain the integrity of our operations. But it doesn't
change our long-term view on the attractiveness of the asset and the development opportunities. I'll let
Pierre address the cash question.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We don't talk about our specific contracts, and there's numbers of them. But I think, in effect, you're
right, there's some escalators tied to inflation. There's some oil price sensitivity. But it's within sort of a
floor and a ceiling. And these are regional gas prices that are well below international prices.
So we don't know how long. We gave the guide on the production and the impact on cash flow is very
modest. It's tens of millions of dollars in terms of doing the calculation. And so we'll just see where we end
up in the quarter and how long it is shut in for.

Maybe switch gears a little bit to the Gulf of Mexico. Can you maybe just provide any update on an overall
basis? Do you anticipate the addition of the Hess assets in the Gulf to have any impact on your approach
to the basin in the coming years?
And then you're scheduled to have 3 separate projects hitting at Anchor, St. Malo and Whale come
onstream during 2024. Could you maybe update us on the progress of those projects and maybe the
timing whether we should expect those in the first half or the second half of the year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So on the combination with Hess, I think we'll come back to you as we close the transaction and we
integrate those. We're partners in a couple of projects that they operate. We both have lease positions
out there. I think you would expect us to high-grade the exploration program as we look across a larger
combined lease position and -- but we'll talk to you more about that as we go forward.
In terms of specific projects, yes, you're right, we've -- Mad Dog 2 actually saw first oil this year. And we
expect peak next year on Mad Dog 2. You can refer to the operator for more on that. Anchor and Whale
are both expected for first oil next year. Anchor is 7 wells in total, 2 that will be online in '24, 3 in '25
-- no, 2 in '25, 2 in '26 and 1 then in '27. The FPU is safely moored out there in the field right now. The
manifold and pump systems and subsea manifolds are all fabricated.
We've landed and tested the 20,000 psi blowout preventer. So that project is moving along nicely.
Production in '24 is modest because there's only a couple of wells online. Think of it midyear in terms of
general timing. I'd refer you to Shell on the Whale project, first oil probably the latter part of 2024 and
a similar kind of a profile, where you've got a smaller number of wells online initially. And then over the
subsequent couple of years, you're going to see additional wells come online.
And so the production impact of that starts to show up in '25 and '26 in a greater way than it does in
2024. And then Ballymore is actually first oil in 2025, not 2024. But that will come online in 2025, simpler
development, tiebacks to Blind Faith, 3 wells, 2 of which would be online in 2025. The third one would
come online in 2026. And so again, the production on that, a little bit in '25 and then you'll see more of it
in '26 and '27.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Ryan, just more broadly on Hess, we are not planning to hold our Investor Day at our usual timing. We'll
likely either have just closed or will be in the antitrust review process. This is a big transaction impacting
Gulf of Mexico but transforms the portfolio overall. We gave some guidance on potential asset sales also.
So you should expect us to do an Investor Day several months after we close and when we have time to
really put together a combined business plan for our investors.

I'd say overall -- and of course, we met with -- I was out. Pierre was in some separate meetings than I
was. But I was out in a number of meetings with John Hess, sometimes with larger Hess shareholders,

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2023 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 27, 2023
sometimes with larger Chevron shareholders. I would say, in general, people see the long-term value
proposition very clearly here.
And I think they see it as a combined company that is stronger and one that is set up to be stronger for
longer with the ability to really sustain cash distributions to shareholders in a very consistent, predictable
and durable fashion long into the future. And so that is -- there's no doubt about that.
Some of the questions, on the one side, did you get a high enough price? On the other side, did you pay
too much, right? So there was tension in the -- in that, to be honest, during the negotiation. It was -- as
we mentioned, this has been going on for some time. And John and I have been looking for a way to do a
deal that is actually one that's good for both sets of shareholders and not easy because it's a great asset
and the market recognizes that value.
And so I think you can find nuances from people who either held one of the stocks or the other for certain
reasons. And maybe this wasn't exactly what they expected. But broadly speaking, I would say people
see the long-term value creation. They see the transparency to resource depth, to production growth.
The fact that you now have -- with Hess, you've got a much more diversified set of assets attached to
their portfolio, which derisks any one of those assets. And it brings forward cash distributions to their
shareholders meaningfully that would have still been several years into the future.
For the Chevron shareholders, who were wondering what comes next after what they can currently see
over the next several years in our portfolio, rather than us pointing to a range of potential answers to
that and say, ""We'll do the best of these,"" and we've got plenty of organic investment opportunities we're
working on, I think it gives some confidence and certainty of what underpins that for the future. And so
broadly speaking, those are the kinds of discussions that we've had.

My question, Mike, is more on your shareholder return. You continue to have great financials and the
shareholder return, both on the dividend and the buyback side, continues to be quite high, paying
out a bit over 100% of your free cash flow. I'm just wondering, as you continue to have the growth
opportunities ahead you do, do you see any change in that shareholder return, particularly on the share
buyback or you continue to try to balance kind of the growth and buyback programs you have now?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. We've had a very consistent set of financial priorities for many, many years. The first of which is to
sustain and grow the dividend, 36 consecutive years now of per share dividend payouts. The last 5 years
has been a 6% CAGR. Actually, I think the last 15 years have been a 6% CAGR and an announcement of
8% early next year, subject to Board approval. I think there's a strong track record there you can expect
to continue.
Second is to be disciplined in organic reinvestment into the business to grow those cash flows. You can be
confident that we will continue to be disciplined in that reinvestment to drive returns and value. Number
3 is a strong balance sheet. Pierre mentioned we're single-digit net debt ratio today. That's lower than we
have guided to over time. And so over time, you can expect the balance sheet to move back towards the
20% to 25% gearing range that we've identified as where we're comfortable through the cycle.
And then the fourth are the share repurchases. And we've got a range now of $10 billion to $20 billion.
We're at the high end of that range when we close the transaction with Hess with $17.5 billion annually.
Today, that's 5% to 6% of our float each and every year. And we've -- I won't go through the details, but
we've indicated we can sustain that in a lower price environment. And that's where the lower end of that
range would apply.

And certainly in a higher price environment, which is where we find ourselves today, we're at the high end
of that range. And so we would expect to be consistent, predictable and to sustain that. I mean, consistent
and durable being the keywords here. So I think the broad framework is likely to remain unchanged. And I
think our behavior will be very consistent with what you've come to see from us historically.

We'll take our final question from Alastair Syme with Citi.
Alastair Roderick Syme
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
Mike, can I go back to Hess? For several years, Chevron has looked a bit different to the other integrated
oil companies in terms of the low downstream exposure. And of course, now you're re-weighting even
further to the upstream. So does that balance bother you at all? Or maybe how do you think about what
an integrated oil company is?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Alastair, the short answer is no, it doesn't bother me. We actually have been becoming a more
downstream-weighted company the last several years. And that may not be obvious to most people, but
we've been -- our CapEx into the upstream has been below our depreciation. So our upstream business
has been declining as a percentage of capital employed.
In the downstream, we've made some big investments. We acquired a refinery in Texas. We acquired a
renewable energy company. We've invested in new petrochemical facilities. We've got 2 more of those
petrochemical expansion projects underway right now. And so we had gone from 80-20 weighting or
85-15 weighting upstream to downstream and chemicals to 80-20 over the last few years. When we close
this transaction, we'll be back at 80-20, which is -- or 85-15, I'm sorry, which is where we've historically
been.
And that reflects a fundamental view that we believe that over the cycle, returns in the upstream are likely
to be structurally higher than in the downstream primarily because refineries are hard to close. They get
built for reasons other than just pure economics. And governments tend to intervene in transportation
fuels markets, in particular, when prices are high, which kind of takes you out of full cycle economics. And
they kind of clip -- tend to put the peaks off of those, whereas in the upstream, you've got a declining
resource base and you've got growing demand. And so the fundamentals rebalance more quickly. You
remove a little bit of investment. And you see decline takeover and you see demand continue to grow. And
so markets that get imbalanced and the upstream rebalance more quickly.
We also have been more oil-weighted than some of our peers. And fundamentally, that reflects a view that
there are more alternatives to substitute for gas, particularly in power generation than there are for liquids
in transportation. And so those are kind of high-level drivers of why our portfolio has been constructed the
way that it is.
We want to be an integrated company. We think there are real opportunities to capture economic value
through integration to build the capabilities to run our entire business by bringing capabilities, technology,
skills to bear across those different segments. But our peers are all weighted more to the up than the
downstream. The ratios are a little bit different. And we've long held those views and constructed a
portfolio that reflects them.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation,
Mr. Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.
Jake Spiering
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Jake Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations.
Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me today. We will refer to
slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin, please be reminded
that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review
the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Jake, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.
Earlier this week, we announced several senior leadership changes, including Pierre's plans to retire next
year, along with second quarter performance highlights. In a few minutes, Pierre will share more details
on our financials, which included return on capital employed greater than 12% for the eighth consecutive
quarter and another quarterly record in shareholder distributions, more than $7 billion.
At TCO, we're making good progress with commissioning and pre start-up activities, including introducing
fuel gas to new facilities. In the third quarter, we expect mechanical completion for the future growth
project and to complete a major turnaround. Cost and scheduled guidance is unchanged.
Conversion of the field from high pressure to low pressure is expected to begin late this year and FGP is
on track to start up by mid next year. We have unused contingency, which gives us confidence that we'll
complete the project within the total budget.
After completion of these projects, TCO is expected to deliver production greater than 1 million barrels of
oil equivalent per day and generate about $5 billion of free cash flow, Chevron share at $60 Brent in 2025.
Chevron's Permian production set another record in the second quarter, about 5% above the previous
quarterly high.
We expect next quarter's production to be roughly flat before growing again in the fourth quarter, on track
with our full year guidance. Early 2023 well performance in our company-operated assets in all 3 areas is
consistent with our plans. In New Mexico, we've put on production at 10 wells. Before year-end, we expect
to pop an additional 30 wells with higher expected production rates. As a reminder, about half of Chevron's
production is company operated with a balanced non-operated and royalty production.
While short-term well performance is one measure, we're focused on maximizing value from our unique,
large resource base expected to deliver decades of high-return production. Over the next 5 years,
we expect to develop over 2,200 net new wells, growing production while delivering return on capital
employed near 30% and free cash flow greater than $5 billion in 2027 at $60 Brent.
Longer term, we've identified well over 6,000 economic net well locations that support a plateau
greater than 1 million barrels per day through the end of next decade. Our deep resource inventory and

advantaged royalty position allow us to optimize our development plans for high returns, incorporating
learnings and technology improvements as we expect to deliver strong free cash flow for years to come.
In the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the floating production unit anchor is on location and the project remains
on track for first oil next year. We continue to build on our exploration success and were awarded the
highest number of blocks in the most recent lease round. In the Eastern Med, our Aphrodite appraisal well
in Cyprus met our expectations, and we've submitted a development concept to the government.
At Leviathan, we're expanding pipeline capacity to nearly 1.4 Bcf per day. We expect to close our PDC
Energy -- our acquisition of PDC Energy in August after their shareholder vote next week. Our teams are
working on integration plans, and we look forward to welcoming PDC's talented employees to Chevron.
Now over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
As Mike said, strong, consistent financial performance enabled Chevron to return record cash to
shareholders this quarter while also investing within our CapEx budget and paying down debt. Working
capital lowered cash flow primarily due to true-up tax payments outside the U.S. Excluding tax payments,
working capital movements are variable. Our typical pattern in the second half of the year is to draw down
working capital.
Chevron's net debt ratio ended the quarter at 7%, significantly below the low end of our guidance range.
Surplus cash on the balance sheet was reduced during the quarter with cash balances ending at $9.6
billion, well above the cash required to run the company.
Adjusted second quarter earnings were down $5.6 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted
upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations, partly offset by higher liftings. Other includes
primarily favorable tax items and income from Venezuela nonequity investments. Adjusted downstream
earnings decreased primarily due to lower refining margins. OpEx was up mainly due to higher
transportation costs and the inclusion of REG.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $900 million. Adjusted upstream earnings
decreased primarily due to lower realizations. This was partially offset by higher production in the U.S.
and nonrecurring tax benefits. Adjusted downstream earnings were down modestly. Lower margins were
partially offset with higher volumes.
Second quarter oil equivalent production was down about 20,000 barrels per day from last quarter
primarily due to planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of Mexico and downtime associated with
the Canadian wildfires. This was mostly offset by growth in the Permian.
Now looking ahead, in the third quarter, we have a planned turnaround at TCO and a planned pit stop at
Gorgon completed earlier this week. Our full year production outlook is trending near the low end of the
annual guidance range.
Since PDC's proxy solicitation on July 7, we've not been permitted to buy back our shares. After we closed
the acquisition in August, we plan to resume buybacks at the $17.5 billion annual rate, which we expect
to continue through the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend from TCO until the fourth quarter. Full
year affiliate dividends are expected to be near the low end of our guidance.
Putting it all together, we delivered another quarter with solid financial results, strong project execution
and continued return of cash to shareholders. Our approach is consistent and you can see that in our
actions and results.
Back to you, Jake.
Jake Spiering
That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Katie, please
open the lines.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Glad to be the first on this call to congratulate Pierre on his retirement. So my first question is on
upstream production. Can you bridge us maybe from the midpoint of your production guidance to the low
end that you mentioned in the opening. It sounds like the Permian is on plan. So what pieces have come
in below the midpoint of plan to move to that well end?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, John. We're -- guidance remains unchanged. We expect to be at the lower end of that. And as we
said, Permian production has been strong. The things that Pierre mentioned, I think, are the key things
that we've seen. There's been some impact of fires in the -- in Canada that have impacted our ability --
not really our operations per se. We did some evacuations on a precautionary basis, but it was midstream
and processing downtime that we weren't able to move our production to market. And the rest of it is and
Benjamins too, I guess, is the other one. We have an FPSO in Thailand that had an incident and early in
the year was taken off station.
And so that's another 10,000 or 11,000 barrels a day yet, which is off for the foreseeable future. And so
it's really those 2 things are the ones that are pushing us down that were both unexpected.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Great. And then my next question is sticking to production, but just drilling in a bit on the Permian. The
well results generally looked very strong in the first half, but still a bit below 2022 in New Mexico. Maybe
you can just update us on what inning you think you're in just in terms of optimizing the single bench
developments in New Mexico?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the thing that I think it's important to bear in mind is that New Mexico type curve we showed
there, there are only 10 POPs represented or 10 POPs that we achieved, all in the second quarter there.
So there's no first quarter POPs. And there's only 7 that actually had enough data to make it into the
curve you see on the chart. So it's a very thin set of data. We expect 30 more POPs in the second half of
this year. So the bulk of the program is not represented in those curves.
And there's a couple of other things. One, the wells we did POP have had some facility constraints that
have limited full productivity. So we actually haven't been able to move all the production due to some
third-party facility constraints that we faced. And the rest of the program is actually in a different part
of the New Mexico portion of the Delaware where we expect higher productivity. So it's a combination
of things, but I really -- I'd caution you not to over index on a very thin data set with a lot more data to
come in the second half of the year.

We'll go next to Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
Pierre, congrats on the retirement. So I wanted to just stick with the Permian since we're on that topic.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit just around the mix trend you're seeing there. And if we
disaggregate the productivity a little bit further, you talk about how much of the uplift is coming from gas
and NGLs versus oil? And then similarly, as you progress towards some of your longer-term production
goals, how you expect the mix in the basin for you to trend oil, gas, NGLs over time?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Devin, we're still drilling primary benches so we can optimize the oil cut. Across the basin, our
production remains roughly 50% oil, 25% NGLs, 25% gas. We look at all the commodities, oil, NGLs
and gas and have our own long-term views on prices and markets to run the economics, to optimize to
returns.
And the gas oil ratio in aggregate has been relatively flat for a number of years and we don't see it
changing a lot. It can vary a little bit in different parts of the basin. But if you take it for our whole
portfolio, that 50%, 25%, 25% remains a pretty good way for you to think about it.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. Great. And then I wanted to shift over to TCO. Good to hear the continued positive progress there
as we get closer to the finish line. There's a lot of moving pieces over the next year, 1.5 years as we get
the 2 phases of development online, you give the guidance for the turnaround impact in 3Q.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you see the evolution of production into the
fourth quarter of this year and then through 2024 as we get to that 2025 run rate, so shape it a bit for us
as we look out over the next few quarters.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the headline here is no change to cost and schedule, I think that's really important. In the
second quarter, we made really good progress. As we said, 98% project completion and commissioning
is essentially 2/3 complete. In the second quarter, we achieved mechanical completion of the 3GI gas
injection facilities and got fuel gas into the flare system, which is very important to enable on-time startup
of FGP.
In the quarter that we're in now in the third quarter, we expect full mechanical completion of the future
growth project and also a turnaround at one of the complex technology lines or KTLs. We'll begin a lot of
work and start up on utility systems, boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for a start-
up of a pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of WPMP, which enables us to convert from high
pressure to low pressure across the field.
Once that that turnaround is done in the third quarter, and you will see some production impact. I think
Pierre guided to that, we expect to have 2 of the 4 big pressure boost compressors online, which allows
us to begin the conversion of metering stations from high pressure to low pressure, and that will initiate
-- we'll get that started at the end of this year. It will take 10 to 12 months for all of those conversions to
occur.
Next year, there will be turnarounds next year as well, 2 more turnarounds, 1 at SGI and another one in
one of KTLs and all of that is part of a very carefully choreographed sequencing of turnarounds and start-
up activity that will bring the full field to the 1 million barrels a day for 2025.
So as we indicated at our Investor Day, what you're going to see in '23 and '24 is the normal turnaround
activity interlaced with all of this project start-up activity. This is not as simple as bringing on a new
portion of the field, really reworking the entire gathering and producing capacity of the field. And so it's
quite a complex series of activities to execute all of that. And so the production reflects that. And we've
put, I think, and said in earnings, a chart to kind of give you some guidance for both this year and next
year.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Slide 10 from our set has annual production '23, '24, '25. No change in that guidance.
Operator
We'll go next to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I want to stay on TCO and while there will be a volume inflection in '25, there's probably going to be a
free cash flow inflection in 2024, just as affiliate CapEx rolls off first. And so just can you talk about the
cadence of that and how it manifests itself in terms of dividends?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We've been guiding, Neil, it's Pierre, to the clean year because that's the $5 billion of free cash flow
at $60 Brent in 2025. And of course, regarding the free cash flow because as you recall, it's not just
dividends, it's also repayment of the loans and the co-lending that we have done along the way and the
profile of those loans are disclosed in our SEC filings.
I mean you will see exactly to your point, you'll see a build towards that just as the CapEx has rolled off
is not, not that long ago, we were investing $3 billion to $4 billion a year our share into the project, and
that's down to $1.5 billion or so this year and will continue to trend down. So there's that inflection point.
What's also being managed, of course, our commodity prices and those vary. And as we've said, TCO
continues to be conservative in managing its balance sheet. But as the -- so it's been holding more cash
on the balance sheet. As the project gets closer to the end, as we've demonstrated that TPC is running
very reliably now for almost 1.5 years, we expect some of that cash to come on.
So I can't get in front of the board of directors of TCO. It's a separate company that we are a shareholder
in, but we expect, as we said, a much bigger dividend in the fourth quarter than we saw in 2Q, and we
expect to see a release of some of that extra -- surplus cash that's been held on the balance sheet, and
that will continue over the next couple of years as we head into that $5 billion of free cash flow in '25.
And maybe the last thing, Neil, I know you know this, TCO has really good price sensitivity. So I've seen
yours and other estimates that [ 70 ] or [ 80 ], the cash flow is even stronger.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
That was great. And the follow-up is just on the return of capital I think you have a big buyback range, a
lot of market participants have kind of viewed your $17.5 billion as the P50 outcome and any reasonable
commodity price environment. And so thinking less of it like a flywheel and more as sort of a relatively
fixed number unless commodity prices go wacky. Just any thoughts on that statement and whether you
-- if you're trying to give us a little bit more a surety around that number as opposed to a more volatile
number.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The range, Neil, is tied to the upside, downside cases that we showed at our Investor Day roughly,
right? So this $10 billion to $20 billion. So you're right, it's a wide range because it reflects a wide range of
prices between that upside case and the downside case. And of course, in between, there's sort of a mid-
cycle case. And as a reminder, that downside case gets to $50 in a couple of years and stays there for 3
years. So that is a real downside case. And that's what the low end of the buyback range is notionally tied
to.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
The upside case is a case that's not too different from what we're seeing now. It averages about $85 over
the 5-year period, it trends down to $70 towards the end of that period. And that's why you're seeing a
buyback very close to the top end of the range at the $17.5 billion. So it's certainly a signal that as we
look out over this commodity cycle, and again, we think of the buybacks as being steady across a cycle
that we feel good about it.
So we said we could do a much larger buyback, but that would be not steady, and we want to be -- we
don't want to be procyclical. We're trying to be across the cycle. And so yes, when we guide on buybacks,
we're guiding with the intent of maintaining it for a number of years across the cycle.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. And Neil, I would just add, you see in our second quarter results, our net debt remains very, very
low. And we've indicated multiple times that we don't have a problem gearing back up and putting more
debt on the balance sheet to get back towards the range that we've guided to through the cycle in order to
sustain a very steady share repurchase program.
Operator
We'll go next to Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Stephen I. Richardson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Mike, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about new energies. I think you've been clear from
the beginning that build versus buy was part of the consideration in a lot of these businesses. We saw a
big CO2 pipeline and EOR company transact recently. So maybe you can talk a little bit about the CCUS
business as you view it? And why build versus buy is maybe the better choice for Chevron? And then
maybe I'd just get ahead of it with a follow-up is maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on buy
then, please.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. Why don't I'll put those 2 together, actually. Look, we'll do both build and buy, I think, in new
energy. So I would fully expect us to do that in renewable fuels. We have built a business, but then we
also went out and acquired Renewable Energy Group.
So I think you'll see both. Certainly, the Denbury transaction is one that the market somewhat anticipated
and you can presume that multiple market players probably took a look at or had conversations with
Denbury. For us, like in CCUS, we look for areas that have good geology or poor space. They're near
concentrated emissions and have the right policy support to enable a business. The Gulf Coast has all of
these things. And while you've been, we've got about 140,000 acres of permanent CO2 sports -- core
space, both onshore and offshore. We've got storage potential there of greater than 1 billion metric tons.
In the second half of this year, we're going to drill a strat well in the offshore acreage to further delineate
and characterize the subsurface. In the first part of next year, we expect to drill a strat well in the onshore
acreage and do the same.
And of course, we're in conversations with a number of customers in that region in the Golden Triangle, up
at Mont Belvieu all the way across the Houston ship channel, and we've got term sheets going back and
forth. We're in negotiations with a number of different potential customers. The commercial framework
for this is still evolving. And we're working on the other pieces you need. So classic well-injection permits
and midstream assets. We've got an RFP out right now with a number of midstream providers consistent
with the way we have generally approached the midstream. We own assets if they're strategic. If there's
a way for us to go to somebody who is in the business of operating -- building and operating midstream
infrastructure, we certainly look at that as well.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
So we're putting all the pieces together there for a phased development. We like the Bayou Bend project,
and we'll report more. But to your kind of underlying question, we'll build organically, and we'll do
inorganic where it makes sense.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Pierre, best of luck with retirement. My first one is on portfolio concentrations. At your Analyst Day, you
talked about just over $20 billion of free cash flow at $60 a barrel and looking through today's slides,
roughly half of that in the medium term will come from the Permian plus TCO. So I understand you want
every dollar to go to the highest level of return, which is completely sensible.
But I was wondering if you can talk about portfolio concentration because it is quite unusual for a super
major to have that level of concentration in terms of free cash flow. So how do you think about portfolio
diversity? And is this something you're actively trying to address going forward? And I've got a follow-up
on a different topic.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Biraj, if you look back over the last decade, we've cleaned up our portfolio. We had a lot of assets that
were kind of at the smaller end of the tail that pulled capital and management time and resources. And we
want to be diversified. We've got a diverse portfolio, but we don't need to be diversified just for the sake
of it. We want to have assets that have scale and are material and long lived.
You can start in the Far East and look at our LNG positions in Australia, which aren't drawing a lot of
capital right now, but are throwing off a lot of cash. We've got a strong position in West Africa that we
strengthened with the Noble acquisition and the EG assets that can feed LNG into Europe. Obviously, you
mentioned TCO. The Eastern Med is a very strong position. We've recently taken FID and are working on
expansion projects for Tamar, Leviathan, and have submitted a concept on Aphrodite. So there's a lot of
opportunity in that asset.
When we close PDC, we're going to be producing 400,000 barrels a day in the DJ Basin. We've talked
about some of our other shale and tight assets in Argentina. In Canada, we've got 2 crackers underway in
CPChem. It will come online middle of this decade, 1 in the U.S. 1 in the Middle East.
We've acquired REG and are growing our renewable fuels business. So we have exposure across a large
portfolio and then, of course, we also have projects coming online in the Gulf of Mexico. I mentioned
Anchor earlier, Whale, Ballymore and we recently acquired more leases in this recent lease sale than the
-- twice as many leases as in the biggest lease sale over the last 8 years. So we're adding to our position
in the Gulf of Mexico. So this idea that we're a 2-asset company, the Permian and TCO, I don't think really
stands up to careful inspection. They are 2 great assets. And so they get a lot of attention, but we've got a
lot of other strong assets in our portfolio.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
If I can just build off that and go to the return of capital question that Neil asked and that's what gives
us confidence not only on the buyback, but on the track record of dividend growth. So we guided to 10%
annual free cash flow coming from all of those businesses.
Some are holding cash constant. Some are growing cash flow that Mike covered, and that goes to leading
dividend growth, where we've grown the dividend over the last 5 years at rates double our closest peer
and much higher than others and where we have a buyback that is nearly 6% of our shares outstanding
annually.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
Our business is built for $50. So part of the confidence in our ability currently, if you look at our breakeven
and adjust for working capital this quarter, if you look at the last 4 quarters, it's actually probably a little
bit lower than that with the strong refining margins that we've been seeing.
So we're built for lower prices. Free cash flow is going to grow from this space. That should give investors
confidence in our ability to continue to grow the dividend at leading rates and to maintain buybacks at also
very high rates.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I've got just a follow-up on a different question. Through the Permian, you'll be producing a lot more
gas over time, and you have expressed the desire to grow in LNG. So you signed a couple of deals as an
offtake to synthetically integrate your U.S. gas position to global markets.
I wanted to ask about sort of whether you'd be interested in owning liquefaction or whether you feel being
an offtaker is enough because some of your peers have argued the benefit of integration and owning
through the value chain. But I think in the past, you've noticed the returns are typically lower.
And I'm particularly interested in asking that question now because a number of players have signed
offtake agreements with companies such as Venture Global and then actually they're not receiving the gas
as agreed. So just interesting how you're thinking about that sort of value chain in LNG?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, it's consistent with what we've described earlier, and I think you've captured it. It depends
on the circumstance in places where we've got remote gas where you need to be in the entire value chain,
and you can create an economic model that supports the investments, we've done that. In other locations
where you've got other people that will put capital into the midstream assets and we can sell gas into
that. We can offtake gas off of it, but not participate in some of the very capital-intensive and lower return
portions of the value chain, that's certainly a model that helps us support our aspiration to drive higher
returns.
Now you have to have good partners. You have to have reliable operations, and we'll work closely with
the companies that we have offtake with. We vet them carefully, and we -- we have confidence in the
people that we are working with to provide those reliable operations. But we're really looking to drive
high returns, not necessarily to own assets for the sake of control, unless it creates a differentiated value
proposition.

We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Question.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sam, you're breaking up.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
The question's on the cash balance, it looks like, nominally, it's drawn down, but it feels -- there's some
inputs that would theoretically help it rebuild in the second half, you've got working capital, and I think
TCO is going to pay a dividend in third quarter and PDC had a very front-loaded capital program too. So

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2023 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 28, 2023
that's coming on with free cash. So just wondering about the cash balance and how you think about the
level or if we're going to be in a rebuild phase for 2H?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, the direction that it goes depends, of course, on commodity prices and margins and a number of
other factors. You're right, our cash levels have come down in part due to working capital outflows, timing
of affiliate dividends. And we've also paid down some debt. We've been, I think, very clear that we don't
want to hold surplus cash, certainly not permanently that it's where the cash goes in the short term. But
over time, that cash is going to be returned to our shareholders in the form of this growing dividend and
ratable buyback program. So we need only about $5 billion to support our operations. We are nearly $10
billion at the end of the second quarter. So that's more than sufficient.
We have access to lots of liquidity. We don't have any commercial paper now again, we've been paying
down debt. So that's the more economically efficient way to manage the balance sheet if we get there and
whether the cash balance goes up or down again, depends on all the inputs and outputs that we've been
showing.
We're guiding towards the net debt, as Mike said, the net debt is well below the low end of our guidance
range. So we look at all those factors. And again, if cash balances head down to $5 billion, that will be
adequate to cover the operations.
On working capital, our pattern in the second half of the year is that we tend to see some draws on it.
But we're certainly not going to recover from what we see in this first half of the year. A big portion of
what we saw in the first half of this year on working capital are really tax payments tied to earnings last
year. So you can kind of think of those as being offset from last year where we had -- where we had that
a favorable working capital environment. So there'll be ups and downs along the way. Over time, working
capital tends to average out over 0, but these are just timing effects. We look through them. We knew we
were -- had taxes due. And so that's all part of the planning as we look at the balance sheet.
Jake Spiering
And Sam, I guess that we've guided to a TCO dividend in the fourth quarter. We do not expect a dividend
in the third quarter.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Got it. Okay. Sorry, I must have misread that remark. The follow-up is actually sort of on the organization,
it's a follow-up to Steve's question earlier, but Pierre had spent some time in an ESG role and a low carbon
role. And the incoming CFO is coming from a role where there was a lot of work on the ground on the low
carbon front on the technology side. And so Chevron has this really interesting sort of marriage between
finance and low carbon that I think is differentiated when you look at some of the peers.
And so the question is as we make progress through the low carbon development, do you feel like you're
embedded in the highest return areas? Or are there other ones where capital is going to maybe pivot, and
I think that ties into carbon capture too because that seems like a place where the incentives are pretty
transparent.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Sam. So I think your question started with people and ended up kind of at our kind of investment
priorities in new energies. Look, across the entire leadership team. We've got a commitment to driving
higher returns and lower carbon and people move through different kinds of roles, but this is part of every
role in the company today. So it's a part of the business. It's something we're committed to.
Our focus is, as we've said before, it's on things where we can leverage our unique capabilities, assets,
value chains, customers to create sustainable competitive advantage in these new energy businesses. It's

why we've not gone into wind and solar on a merchant basis because there's others that can do that, and
we don't really bring anything unique there.
Our renewable fuels business today is profitable and generating cash. We expect to start up the Geismar
expansion and be producing more renewable diesel next year. So that's a business today that is economic
and attractive, and we continue to grow, particularly back into the feedstock side. We announced an
acquisition this last quarter of a small company that's got some interesting feedstock technology.
Carbon capture and storage obviously is being built. We do it today in some assets. But as a business,
we're building out Bayou Bend I talked about. We're working on projects in other parts of the world as
well. And we do believe that with the right technology, the right business model and policy environment
that there's an opportunity there.
Other things that we're working on hydrogen is one that both electrolytic hydrogen and then traditional
hydrogen paired with carbon capture and storage. In the U.S., the IRA incentives can certainly support the
development of business models there.
So I think we'll stay consistent with this. We're looking at it -- always looking at new technologies, but the
area we're focused on is the primary area you should expect to see us investing.
Operator
We'll go next to Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division
Pierre, congrats on your retirement. I'd like to go back to the Permian detail for a minute, if I could, and
kind of 2 questions on this. First, has CapEx in the Permian deviated at all from that $4 billion budget
that you highlighted at the Analyst Day? And then the second part, on the Permian inventory over the
5-year plan and long term, how much -- what percentage of those locations would you categorize as
[indiscernible] ?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jason. Permian CapEx is up a little bit this year, primarily 3 things. Number one, we've actually seen
drilling performance continue to improve and completions performance continue to improve. So out of
the same fleet of rigs and completion spreads, we're getting more work done, which means you consume
more tubulars, more sand, more water, et cetera. So that's kind of a good thing.
We're seeing some longer lead times on some of the critical elements in facilities. And so we've actually
had to make some long lead purchases for next year's program that we didn't anticipate as we were lining
up this year's program. And then we've increased facility scope for water handling in some areas of the
Permian, particularly as we're trying to manage some of these induced seismicity issues. We're being more
careful, moving more water. And so that has all led to some increase in CapEx.
Not a lot of inflation there. The inflation has been largely in line with what we had expected, and the rig
fleet is being activated in line with what we expected.
Your second question on inventory, we don't really -- we haven't broken our portfolio into tiers. There's not
a very clear definition of that in a way to kind of do that on a standard basis. So when we've outlined the
drilling locations and the long-term guidance there, it's really based on economics. And we've got locations
that are economic at our price view for the future, which has historically not been a super aggressive price
view. It's based on today's technology. And as indicated, we've got more than 6,000 locations in that outer
time window that are economic based on those assumptions. By the time we get to that window, we may
or may not see a different price environment. I fully expect we'll see a different technology environment,
which can allow that number to grow even further. So -- we look at it more in terms of the economics of
the development than tiers.

Jason Daniel Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division
Great. And my follow-up, just going back to TCO. You made some comments on kind of maintenance
effects over the next 4 quarters. And I know you showed it graphically. But are you able to quantify the
actual impact to production over the next 4 quarters from all these turnarounds and start-up activities?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, Jason, we do it quarterly, like it's included in the third quarter guidance that we provided, and we'll
continue to do that quarterly, and you're seeing it sort of annually, we're giving annual guidance on TCO.
So it's all embedded in there. I think we showed it relative to '22, but there's just a lot of moving parts,
but we'll continue to give that guidance each quarter and you have annual guidance that incorporates all
of that.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe Generale.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
My first question is on the downstream, please. If you can talk around the performance of your chemicals,
particularly in Q2, and then what you're seeing so far in the third quarter? And then also what you would
expect in terms of refining margin evolution in the second half of the year, given the weakness in Q2?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the chemicals business is cyclical, as everybody knows. We're certainly in a period now where
we're seeing some length in supply due to new build facilities, some -- so there's some length there is
weighed on margins in the olefins chain. And in the short term, we think we're going to continue to see
that would be a pretty tough sector.
Longer term, as you get out to mid-decade and beyond, demand will continue to grow, and we expect
demand and supply will come into better balance, and we'll see those margins recover out towards the
middle and second part of this decade.
Your second question -- I'm sorry, I was thinking about chemicals there and...
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
Or the refining that refining outlook...
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Refining margins, yes. Certainly, we've seen refining margins come off the very strong levels that they
were at last year. There's been some new capacity come into the system around the world, some big
new refineries that have begun to start up or major projects that have come online. And so margins have
softened year-on-year. .
Certainly, the West Coast in our portfolio is important, West Coast margins, both in the refining and the
marketing part of the value chain have held up a little bit better because it's a market that is a little bit
more cut off from the rest of the world than the Gulf Coast or Asia. And so demand continues to be pretty
strong out there.
Gasoline demand is strong. Jet demand continues to come back. Diesel demand has maybe flattened out a
little bit, but certainly holding. And so -- we're in an environment where I would expect the inventories are

towards the lower end of the products in a number of parts of the world. I think refining margins for the
second half of this year will be -- are likely to be as good as they were in the first half of the year at least.

Am I allowed a follow-up? Sorry.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, just go ahead.
Irene Himona

Based on that, following your FID for the pipeline in Israel, I was wondering, is that it for the time being
for Leviathan? Or do the partners continue to examine other options like FLNG, for example?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. No, we continue to evaluate other options. In fact, we're working towards a concept select for the
next expansion of Leviathan ideally at the end of this year. And floating LNG is one of the concepts that we
continue to look at.
Operator
We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Great. Maybe if I could follow-up on some earlier Permian conversations. You talked a little bit about some
of the New Mexico well performance. But on well performance overall that you disclosed, it appears that
first half results are showing improved performance across much of the basin as you expected.
What have you seen to date in terms of addressing -- I know you don't have a lot of data -- but in terms
of addressing some of the concerns from last year, particularly what have you learned regarding spacing,
single versus multi-bench approach, et cetera, on the wells that you've done so far this year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, the performance is really consistent with our expectations and what we outlined at our
Investor Day later this year, Ryan. There are a couple of things just to remember, I mentioned earlier that
in New Mexico, we saw some infrastructure and third-party constraints. And you can have that -- we've
got that in some other parts of our portfolio as well.
So there are things that will show up in these curves that are not necessarily just a reflection of the
geology and the well performance. And as we continue to change our development strategy on well
spacing, proppant loading, well length, et cetera, those will continue to be reflected in these curves.
The thing that is really important is production -- we put production out there because everybody likes to
see it. We're not optimizing the production. We're optimizing the returns. And so fluid mix, EUR, capital
investments are all important parts of what we're optimizing too. It's harder for you to see all the things
that we're looking to optimize to drive returns when you're just looking at production. So -- but the high-
level answer is performance in line with the expectations as we've continued to evolve our program.

Okay. And maybe if we turn to the Gulf of Mexico, as we think about your Gulf of Mexico Deepwater
portfolio, you've got an impressive string of project start-ups coming over the next few years. How
exposed are you to escalating trends in Deepwater drilling and development costs as you look across
those projects? Do you have costs locked in across some of those projects, rigs under multiyear contracts,
et cetera? Or is this I guess, how much are you able to mitigate cost escalation as we think over kind of
CapEx requirements over the next few years?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Those projects were contracted at a different time. So they reflect mostly locked in rates as you'd
expect, procurements well behind us as we're getting as those projects are pretty far along. So new
exploration activity will get exposed to some of the higher rig rates on that. But for the existing major
capital projects, that's largely locked in.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We came into the year with 3 rigs under contracts that were contracted back in a different environment. .
Okay. We've got a handful of people still in the queue.

We'll go next to Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
First one is wish Pierre an exciting and very happy post retirement. Thank you for the help over the past
20-plus years. Maybe the 2 questions, if I could. One, you're talking about your development plan in sites
discovery. Can you give us a little bit in terms of the timeline, what should we expect? And also that what
is the preliminary design of the development is going to look like in the scale and what kind of time that is
going to see the first oil?
The second question that you haven't talked much about Argentina and over there, the government seems
to be pretty excited with the shale oil development and you have a position there. Can you give us an
update what is your thinking over there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul, in Cyprus, we've -- we're pleased with the outcome of the recent appraisal well. We've
submitted our development plan to the government for their approval and it involves a capital efficient
way to take the gas to market to be a subsea tiebacks to existing infrastructure. But this is all pending
government approval. If we get that, we could be in the feed later this year, but it's a little early for us to
really lay anything out on first gas. So as we get through the government approval process, we'll be back
to talk to you about the timeline on that one.
On Argentina, we remain very positive on the resource there. There's an election coming up. The country
has got some kind of macroeconomic challenges that it's facing right now. But we like the -- particularly
our El Trapial area where we're doing some more development work now with some increased capital that
flows with that. And we'll talk to you about that at Investor Day and beyond. But no real changes there.
It's going to be part of the growth story.

Pierre, it's been a pleasure. Congratulations and good luck to everybody. And Mike to you as well on your
extended tenure. Guys, my first question is on the Permian ratability. It looks like you've got about a
couple of hundred POPs this year, wells to sales. 2,000 over the next 5 years. Is that ratable? How should
we think about step up in activity?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Just one thing, it's the co-op POPs is 200. But if you were to include net POPs, again, half of our portfolio
is non-open royalty, it'd be more like 300. So it looks more consistent, right, the long-term plateau and
the well inventory, the 2,200 over the next 5 years incorporates all of the activity and the POP data was
just on company operate. So there is some increase, but not as not as large as it looks. You just got to get
apples-to-apples.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
It'd fairly ratable, Pierre, I mean, like 500 a year type of deal or 400 a year type of deal?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. As we get up to activity and as Mike said, we're becoming more efficient, as our other operators that
we work with, yes, it's going to be pretty ratable once we get full up to our full rate activity.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Of course, Doug, quarter-to-quarter, there's some variability as we saw first quarter to second quarter
of this year. Third quarter is going to be a little -- so there can be some surges in plateaus quarter-to-
quarter, but on an annual basis, yes, it's going to be pretty ratable.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
That's helpful. My follow-up guys is on Tengiz, but it's a slightly different question. I guess Pioneer is
similar vintage. You signed Tengiz in 1993. It expires 6 years after the end of your Analyst Day trajectory
through 2027, it's 1/4 of your free cash flow. So my question is, what are your options there, whether
we extend or replace and perhaps maybe some color on what the production profile looks like post 2027,
Wood Mac is going into fairly severe decline after 2030. So I just want to know what you're thinking about
the long-term sustainability of those free cash flows?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the concession is a decade away, we're focused on delivering the project right now. This is a big
complex asset, a big complex project. We'll certainly be in discussions with the government over time
about a potential extension of this. It will reflect what we see in terms of reservoir performance and in
production opportunities out into the future. These concession discussions have to create value for the
country and for Chevron. So we got to find something that works for both parties. We've walked away
from concessions as you've covered extensively, Doug, where it didn't work for us in places like Indonesia
and Thailand, we've extended in places like Angola, where it did. So we'll be talking more about that over
time. But right now, we're really focused on project execution and delivering FGP.

Our last question comes from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.

I guess Mike first question for you. With the extension of your tenure, you're willing to share with us what
some of the things you're hoping to get done in the extra time will be -- or maybe what some of the real
opportunities are here that you'd like to shepherd through?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Roger, it's been a pretty turbulent first part of my tenure with a major restructuring, of pandemic and
oil prices that collapsed, a war and oil prices that spiked, the political and geopolitical noise that comes
with those things, the ongoing climate and ESG issues, 3 acquisitions, one of which we still haven't closed.
And so I'm actually looking forward to a little smoother water, I hope, one day.
And look, we still have work to do to continue to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And so it's to
continue that work. We've got good momentum in our business. We've delivered strong results through
all of that turbulence and have maintained strong shareholder distributions throughout and strategic
consistency throughout where we've seen others in the industry buffeted it around a little bit by these
forces. And so I'd like to continue that and to drive more value to our shareholders and higher returns and
lower carbon.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Right. I commend you for not trying to duck out when things finally look good for at least a short time. My
follow-up question is really much more on the modeling front. If we look at your realizations on oil, they
were much stronger here in the second quarter. I think that contributed to some of the performance, but
what we really saw was a dip Q1 and improvement in Q2 kind of back in line with traditional. So I was just
wondering as we think about -- was that a timing issue, a regional issue first quarter anything you should
-- we should be thinking about as we look at your realization or capture on oil prices going forward?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Roger, our view that -- not quite picked that up. So why don't you follow up with Jake after the call and
make sure we understand your questions and give you our best take on it. But our oil realizations have
looked good and our natural gas realizations have looked strong. We had a little more -- we had better
timing in the first quarter. So if you look quarter-on-quarter in some of our international gas, it might
seem a little weaker. But I'm not sure on liquids. So please follow up with Jake.
Jake Spiering

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation, Mr.
Jake Spiering. Please go ahead.
Jake Spiering
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron’s first quarter 2023 earnings conference call and webcast. I’m Jake
Spiering, General Manager of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre
Breber, are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on
Chevron’s website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now, I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Jake. Chevron delivered strong financial results again last quarter, the seventh
consecutive quarter with return on capital employed greater than 12%. This enabled another record for
cash returned to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
Since our investor day two months ago, we’ve remained focused on executing our plans: achieving
important milestones on our major project in Kazakhstan; continuing to build activity levels in the
Permian; positioning Bayou Bend to be one of the largest carbon storage projects in the United States;
and safely and reliably delivering oil products and natural gas that help power the global economy.
Next week, we’ll publish our corporate sustainability report. I encourage you to review it on our website as
we provide updates on the ESG topics that matter to our business and our stakeholders.
In closing, while commodity markets remain uncertain, our approach is unchanged: capital and cost
discipline applied to advantaged assets in both traditional and new energy businesses; and steady returns
of cash to shareholders. You can see that consistency in our actions and our results.
Now to Pierre to discuss the quarter.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.6 billion, or $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings
were $6.7 billion, or $3.55 per share. We had one special item this quarter related to changes in the
energy profits tax in the United Kingdom. The appendix of this presentation contains a reconciliation of
non-GAAP measures.
Strong operating cash flow enabled Chevron to deliver on its financial priorities during the quarter: a 6%
per share dividend increase; higher CapEx within budget; net debt ratio under 5%; share repurchases at
the top of our prior guidance range.
Adjusted first quarter earnings were up over $200 million versus last year despite 20% lower oil prices.
Adjusted Upstream earnings were lower mainly due to realizations and adjusted downstream earnings
increased primarily due to higher refining margins. Both segments benefited from a change in timing

effects. Higher interest income and lower accruals for stock-based compensation decreased all other
charges.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down $1.1 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings
decreased primarily due to lower realizations. Other items include the absence of last quarter’s dividend
withholding tax at TCO and lower exploration and transportation expenses. Adjusted Downstream earnings
were essentially flat. Lower margins and volumes were offset with higher chemical earnings and other
favorable items including trading results. Lower accruals for incentive-based compensation decreased all
other net charges and also benefited the operating segments.
First quarter oil equivalent production was down about 80 thousand barrels per day from last year due to
the expiration of a contract in Thailand and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset. This was partially offset by
growth in the Permian. We expect 2023 production growth in the Permian to be back-end loaded as wells
put on production, POPs, increase across both operated and non-operated areas. We expect our royalty
production to be roughly flat.
As discussed during our Investor Day, we're increasing activity in New Mexico. All four company-operated
rigs added this year, one each quarter, will be in New Mexico leading to more POPs expected in the
second half of the year and into 2024. We also continue to be active in Texas. Last year, about half of our
company-operated production was in the Delaware Basin in Texas with the remainder split about evenly
between the Midland Basin and New Mexico.
More than half of our non-operated production is with five major operators in large, contiguous positions
in core areas of multi-year development programs, where we have visibility to CapEx and execution
schedules and a royalty benefit compared to the operator.
The balance is with dozens of other operators where we have a little less visibility, but similar predictability
from greater diversification. More than half of our royalty production comes from the Pecos River area in
the heart of the Delaware Basin. The balance of our royalty position is in the remainder of the Delaware
and Midland Basins, also with well-known operators. In summary, Chevron has a large, diverse position in
the Permian with a unique royalty advantage where we learn from our own operations and from others.
Now, looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect planned turnarounds at Gorgon and in the Gulf of
Mexico along with downtime at an FSO in Thailand and a number of planned refinery turnarounds. Also,
we expect share buybacks to increase to a $17.5 billion annual rate.
In summary, 1Q was another quarter with strong financial results, continued capital discipline, and a
steady return of cash to shareholders. We're confident that consistent and straightforward management,
through commodity cycles, will create value for stakeholders.
Back to you, Jake.
Jake Spiering
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please limit yourself to
one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie, please open
the lines.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So there was some helpful detail in the slides and the remarks on the breakdown of Permian operations.
If I look at the quarter, your volumes did fall a bit sequentially in 1Q versus 4Q. I was wondering if you
could just talk in a bit more detail about some of the drivers there. How things are going as you ramp New
Mexico activity and then specifically the confidence that you have in that back half-weighted production
ramp?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks, Devin. And Pierre tried to show a little more detail, including breaking out co-op, NOJV and
royalty talking about drilling activity and feet drilled, et cetera. So glad that, that was helpful. First quarter
performance was a function of really the fact that NOJV and royalty production, which as you can see from
that chart, is a meaningful portion of our overall production. It was down a little bit from fourth quarter of
last year.
Now this gets a little lumpy due to how it gets reported by partners. And so over time, it's trended up,
particularly the NOJV piece. But it was a little lumpy and it was down first quarter versus fourth quarter
last year. Co-production was mostly flat from 4Q of last year to first quarter of this year.
In terms of the full year outlook, on Slide 9 we show full year outlook. It's about 770,000 barrels a day.
'22 was a little bit over 700,000 707,000, I think. Our co-op production will grow in the mid-single digits.
NOJV, we expect to grow in the mid-teens. And royalty is roughly flat year-on-year is our expectation. So
that kind of lays out first quarter and we still think that the guide we give is appropriate, as Pierre said,
back-end loaded. So we'll be updating each quarter on that.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. Makes sense. And my follow-up is on TCO. And it's exciting that we're now less than a year away
from start-up there. And back at the Investor Day, you noted that you had shifted to commissioning and
the start-up work for WPMP. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how things are going
there, latest expectations on timing and then also the key milestones that we should be keeping an eye
out for, for the balance of this year, ahead of start-up.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, absolutely. I actually was in Kazakhstan earlier this month. I had a chance to meet with the President
of the Republic, some other senior officials and also spent time down at Tengiz and visited the job site,
talked to both people from our construction team, people from the commissioning team, people from
operations as we're preparing for a start-up. And I'll tell you, it looks a little less like a construction site, a
little bit more like a plant than it did the last time I was down there.
So the progress is very obvious. The headline I'll give you is there's no change to our cost or schedule
guidance. We expect WPMP start-up to begin by the end of this year. Now that's the conversion of the field
from high pressure to low pressure. So that will take some time as we take all the metering stations and
field infrastructure down to low pressure, but that will still begin by the end of this year and the start-up of
the future growth project, the portion that adds 260,000 barrels of oil production. That will begin by mid
next year.

Both of these require a series of turnarounds and tie-ins and things like that. So it's quite a complex set
of activities to get us to the point where we've got everything online. But there's a lot of work behind us.
While I was there, we achieved mechanical completion on the third-generation sour gas injection facility,
which was ahead of schedule. And there are a number of milestones that I mentioned or we talked about
at the Investor Day that we've achieved. So we completed tie-in of the fuel gas system to the first gas
turbine generator.
We fired that generator, so we know that it's working. In the second quarter, in terms of milestones to
watch for, we're working to commission boilers, steam system, other utilities that are required for the
start-up of the pressure boost facility, which is the key driver of that conversion from high-pressure to low-
pressure field operations to enable sustained well deliverability. In the third quarter, we expect mechanical
completion of the future growth project and then as I said, we'll begin start-up activities on the field
conversion to low pressure by the end of this year.
So those are some of the key milestones. And like I say, a lot behind us, but there's still a lot of complex
work ahead. We'll be updating you on it every quarter.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Yes. Mike and Pierre, the first question is just around the LNG portfolio. A lot of volatility in the global gas
markets over the course of last year. I'd just be curious how you guys are seeing the outlook and any
updates on your portfolio, particularly down in Australia. We're recognized you're going to be taking some
maintenance, but it seems like it's operating pretty well.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So look, overall, it's been a bit of a wild ride in gas markets over the last year. And we've seen prices
extraordinarily strong. If you go back 2 years ago, they were extraordinarily weak. And they've certainly
moderated now as we've had warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere through the wintertime as the
situation in Europe has, I think, become a little more stable. Certainly, inventories both in Europe and in
the U.S. are much healthier than people were concerned about at one point in time.
And so we're into a market that still is perhaps strong by historic standards, but certainly not nearly as
strong as what we saw. Operations at Gorgon and Wheatstone are running very well. We had a record
number of LNG cargoes go out of Australia last year. It was 10% better than the best year we've ever had.
Reliability was first quartile for the 2 facilities. And so we feel good about that. We've started -- or this
year, we'll start the second turnaround cycle, which is a 4-year cycle to turn trains around Gorgon Train 1.
We'll have a major planned turnaround in the second quarter of this year.
And of course, we're working on the next stage of field development to continue to keep the field full
with wells drilled and start-up activity, tie-in activity, et cetera, underway on the next phase of the gas
developments to bring that into the facility. So things in Australia are good from an operational standpoint
and a reliability standpoint.
More broadly speaking, we continue to look at opportunities in our LNG portfolio beyond Australia.
Certainly, we've talked at some length about the Eastern Med. So belabor that, but looking at concepts
and expect to select the concept on the Leviathan expansion by the end of this year.
And in Equatorial Guinea, we're looking at opportunities to bring additional gas resources in through
existing infrastructure. So continue to be very focused on what we can do to add value in our LNG
business, but to do it in a way that's returns accretive.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
That's great. And then the follow-up is just on return of capital. And I think you guys have been pretty
clear about the range that we should be thinking about from a buyback perspective, just on dividend
growth. Just talk about how do you expect that to track relative to your free cash flow per share
expectations?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I think we have been clear on buybacks, so I won't spend time on that. On dividends, I would say our
track record should speak for itself. Of course, these are decisions that are made by the Board each year,
but we've got 36 consecutive years now of higher payouts. Over the last 5 years, our dividend growth per
share has been double that of our closest peer. So we've sustained this not over the long haul, but also
in the short term through the volatile period of time that we've seen our dividend track record, I think,
stands very well.
I'll reiterate our 4 financial priorities, the first of which is to sustain and grow the dividend as I just
mentioned, a 6% increase earlier this year and a compound annual growth rate of 6% over the last 15
years. So I think again, I'll say our track record on the dividend speaks for itself. I think Pierre mentioned
that the quarter we just closed included the highest ever cash distributions to shareholders for the fourth
consecutive quarter that we can say that. And we're very mindful of continuing to deliver cash in a
predictable and consistent manner back to shareholders through both of those vehicles.
Operator
We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes. Maybe come back to the Permian a little bit. I know you've been providing us a lot more detail on
things and appreciate that and the detail for the overall production breakdown in the U.S. But looking at
the Permian, the Chevron-operated portion versus your JV non-op, as we think about some of the snags
that have been hit over the last couple of quarters, where have been the biggest problems?
Has it been in the operated or the non-operated? And then as you think about correcting those over the
next couple of quarters, how much of that is Chevron control versus partner?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So I will speak to our operated operation because I really can't speak on behalf of the others. They
should speak on behalf of their operations. We certainly learned from those. But we spent a pretty good
amount of time at the Investor Day talking about the learnings on drilled but uncompleted wells and
sat for a long time talking about the prior basis of design for the wells including spacing and proppant
loading, talking about multi-bench development and we've learned a lot from our own operations, and
those learnings are augmented by the things that we learned from others.
And so we talked about more single-bench development, more activity in New Mexico. We continue to be
very focused on driving strong returns and not optimizing to production or some other metric. Just to give
you a little bit more guidance, Roger, for this year in terms of how to think about it. We expect royalty
production to be roughly flat in the neighborhood of a little bit over 100,000, maybe 110,000 barrels a
day. Most of that comes from the Pecos River area where we've got big operators, Oxy is largest operator
in that area, but others that are well-known operators in that area. And then we've got some that comes
in from the Midland as well from big operators where there's a lot of visibility into what their plans are.
Our co-op production growth, we expect to be mid-single digits for the full year. Maybe a touch higher
than the midpoint of single digits and expect roughly 190 wells to be put on production this year, which is
down a little bit from last year, maybe 10% from last year when our co-op production increased 35,000
barrels a day. We've got growth in the Texas side of the Delaware earlier in the year, the New Mexico side
later in the year, which follows the chart Pierre showed you with drilling lateral feet. And then in the NOJV,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
the growth is higher. It's in the mid-teens for the full year. The gross number of POPs in our NOJVs are
expected to be up about 15% year-on-year.
And it's interesting our net POPs actually increased more than the gross because we have relatively high
working interest and a significant royalty advantage in the non-ops. And so a 15% increase in gross POPs
actually translates into more production than you might presume. We've got really good visibility into the
execution schedule. We've received more than 3/4 of the AFEs for this year's activity. And operations have
actually begun on more than 3/4 of the NOJV wells that we expect to be POP-ed this year.
So it's a mix. We've got a really strong but also a bit of a complex portfolio because of these 3 different
contributors, and we're continuing to hold the guidance, as I said earlier, at about 770,000 for full year.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
No, that's great. I appreciate that. And a follow-up question, I suspect, is for you, Pierre. Working capital,
obviously tends to be a draw in Q1. You've got the sounds like a decent level of planned maintenance in
Q2. So just any thoughts on how we should look at overall cash flow generation Q2, maybe rest of the
year in terms of the cadence?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, in terms of working capital, Roger, the first quarter, as you said, was a build in working capital draw
on cash, and that was primarily inventory related. If you saw last year, we had draws on working capital,
that was primarily through taxes payable. And you'll see in the second quarter, some of those payments
happening. We try to give everything excluding working capital because over the course of time, that
tends to zero out and there's a pattern, but there's some variability around it.
So that's the guidance I would give on you. In terms of free cash flow, it depends on -- and cash from
ops depends on commodity prices and margins, and we gave a lot of that during our Investor Day and
some upside and downside cases. But in terms of working capital, you'll see timing effects. We try to look
through them and exclude them. And then next quarter, you should expect some large tax payments,
which will be obviously a draw on cash.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Have been the kind of project due to the characteristic that we have different returns and different
payback period criteria that I think management put so for your low-carbon investment, not those that
for the own emission mitigation activity, but that in terms of like CCUS as a new business, for that kind of
business that what is the minimum internal rate of return and payback period that you assign in order for
you to sanction the projects.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul. Look, the reality is these are brand-new businesses. And we've got a lot of confidence in the
returns and payback periods that we expect out of businesses we've been in for many decades and
understand very well in well-established markets. These are businesses that don't exist today. They are
in part enabled by a government policy, the rules of which are not yet fully written and the durability of
which we need to ask ourselves questions about as we commit capital to it. So they're different. They're
very different. Our goal over the long term is to get similar returns out of these businesses as we get out
of our core business.
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
And so that would be double-digit returns. In the midterm to the near term, we're going to have to go into
some of these things that offer high growth and opportunity with our eyes wide open, but also understand
that as we establish them in the early days, we may not see the returns that we expect in the fullness of
time. So we make big investments. Our expectation is over the life cycle of these investments, we're going
to deliver those kinds of returns. But we're also mindful of the fact we've got to develop technology.
We've got to scale these things. We've got to help markets mature. We've got to build operational
experience. We've got to build risk management experience, supply chain and customer capabilities in
these businesses. And so in the near term, we'll be understanding of the fact that the returns in the short
term will probably look different than our long-term expectations but we won't go into things that we
don't believe offer the long-term prospect for returns, which is why we have steadily avoided more well-
established sectors like wind and solar, where we could go into those today because the risks are better
defined, but we also understand the returns.
And so we were just trying to do these kinds of projects, we would go into those, but they don't offer the
kinds of returns we expect out of the things that we're working on.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
A second question is that your largest U.S. competitor just announced that they're going to push more
aggressively into trading and establish a single trading organization and think that there's quite a fair
amount of opportunities out there in the market that they can capture. The sensory thinking maybe that
someone of a rule book from -- that pay book from Chevron. I think Chevron has always been a little bit
more conservative on that.
So do you think that [ leaves ] the opportunity for a company similar to Chevron that have a lot of global
reach and more of a physical ones and have a knowledge edge over others. So is there an opportunity that
we may be missing for Chevron?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Paul, what I would say is I think maybe your perception is a little bit miscalibrated from what I would
describe. We have always had a global trading organization for many, many years, I used to run it. Pierre
used to run it. And so we're an active trader. We trade in a certain way. And I'll give you the 3-word kind
of overarching description, we flow, optimize and trade. So the first role of our commercial organization is
to ensure our barrels and molecules flow to the market.
The second is to optimize assets, ships, market positions, market knowledge and be sure we get the most
value out of our system that we possibly can. And then the third responsibility is to trade. And we do
third-party training, we do what we call Quad 4 trading. On a regular basis, we make money at it, and
we have very talented people in our organization, too. We also have good risk management systems to
ensure that we understand what we're doing. So I wouldn't describe us as not being a trader. And I don't
know if there's a definition, I think you used the word conservative.
Look, we're a trader, but we do it in the order that I just described and have done it for a long time on
a global basis. So it's a contributor to our earnings, and we continue to look to grow that part of our
business.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
The only thing I would add, Paul, to Mike's answer is shareholders and investors don't own Chevron or
like companies for trading earnings. They tend to be volatile. I think the multiples on trading earnings
historically have been very low. In fact, most of the large trading houses are private companies. So
Mike described exactly what our strategy is. It works within the framework of a resource company and
a refining and petrochemicals company where investors are owning us for safely and reliably delivering

energy having the commodity price exposure. And yes, if we can enhance that with trading results, that's
great, but we're not going to lead with trading.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
This one is just a clarification question on something you said about the Permian because I think it's
important. In the NOJV section, because you stack royalties with the NOJV acreage, your growth rate in
the NOJV portion actually exceeds the growth rate of your partners as they report it. Is that -- that's the
correct interpretation, right? That's what we're trying to communicate?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean our -- because we not only get our working interest production out of that, but because we
also have -- and we have relatively high working interest in most of our -- these ventures. So it's not
dissimilar to the working interest of the operator in most cases. But then we also have royalty advantage
and we -- and we account for that or we report that to you through that NOJV. What we describe as
royalty barrels are pure royalty.
We've got no capital. We've got no working interest. We're just collecting royalty as the landowner. But
you're correct in your interpretation there, Sam. That is why our NOJV is growing a little faster than our
co-op production for the same levels of activity.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. And then just as a follow-up. This is on capital allocation and I understood that you have the range
out there in the buyback, but the range is pretty substantial, and there is a decision to make right now
about where to be within the range, about whether to preserve cash for an opportunity that might come in
the downturn, if that's what looks like it's on the horizon or whether to stay at the top end because we're
in sort of a market equilibrium in the commodity environment, and you feel good about the pace.
And I'm not asking you to predict the future, but it would be great to sort of hear your thoughts
directionally about the value of kind of preserving cash on the balance sheet for any day or maintaining a
faster pace?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I'm going to invite Pierre to say a couple of words. But Sam, we tried to lay out a couple of cases
in Investor Day that showed you in 2 different price environments what our capacity was to operate and
be within the range and with a low breakeven to cover our CapEx and dividend with a lot of surplus cash
already on the balance sheet and then with the very low net debt -- low debt levels that we have. We've
got plenty of capacity. Pierre, maybe you can just give a thumbnail recap on the scenarios to booking
them for Sam.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. In our Investor Day, we looked at the high-case and low-case scenarios and our guidance right now
is towards the high end. And let me just first be clear that we don't intend to hold $15-plus billion of cash
on our balance sheet. We can run the company at $5 billion, and this is surplus cash. And this is cash
that is temporarily on the balance sheet. It will be redistributed and redeployed to shareholders over time
depending on the scenario and the price of both scenarios had us working down that surplus cash because
it's economically inefficient for us hold it, and it's not our cash, it's our shareholders' cash.
We want to return it through the cycle in a steady way, not pro-cyclically. So that's why it's accumulating.
We've paid off all our debt economically, but it's a timing effect. And we showed certainly in the low-side
case, which averaged about a $60 Brent that we could continue buybacks near the low end of the range,
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
and we can do that on by taking surplus cash down. And then also using some of our excess debt capacity
because we're well below our 20% to 25% net debt ratio. So we'd want to work towards that low end of
that guidance range of 20%, again, to get to a more efficient capital structure.
In terms of keeping cash for rainy or strong -- we're always going to maintain a strong balance sheet.
We've been in this business for decades and decades. We know that good times don't last. We know that
prices are cyclical. We want to manage that volatility for our shareholders. So our shareholders don't have
to worry about the commodity price because they're going to get the dividend that Mike talked about
that's been growing for 36 consecutive years. That's grown 6% annually for 15 years. They're going to get
that. And then through a cycle, as we approach a cycle, and we're looking at the cycle coming up here,
additional cash in a steady way, right now, about 5% of our shares outstanding through the form of a
buyback.
And so that's how we're planning to manage the volatility for our shareholders. And we've talked about
if M&A is implied in your question that we shown that we tend to use equity for M&A because there is --
commodity prices are volatile. It creates a more stable deal structure. So our balance sheet will always be
strong enough to enable us to not only manage commodity prices, but also make sure we're positioned to
do what we need to do.
And I don't need to remind you that we were the first to do a transaction coming out of COVID when
we announced the acquisition of Noble Energy, and then we followed a year or so later and acquired
Renewable Energy Group. Thanks, Sam.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So can you talk about the general demand trends you're seeing within your system? Are you starting to
see any signs of weakness on the demand side? And if the answer is no, just curious on your views on
what's happened to spot refining margins globally, and what seems like still a relatively tight market.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So John, a couple of thoughts, I guess. I'll just go by the product commodities. I mean gasoline
demand is essentially back to pre-pandemic levels. globally. Obviously, there are regional variations in
this. We're sitting in California here on this end of the call. We've had a very wet winter. And so the first
quarter reflects an unusually wet season on the West Coast.
In Asia, we see demand coming back, right, as economies continue to open up and mobility has increased,
et cetera. But broadly speaking, gasoline flat. Diesel had kind of carried the complex through COVID
and global demand has been at pre-pandemic levels for a while now. First quarter demand in '23 is a
touch lower than it was in first quarter of '22. Could be an indicator of the beginning of some economic
slowdown, but it's certainly, I think, premature to conclude that. But diesel is maybe not leading the
parade quite as strongly as it had been for the last couple of years.
Jet demand continues to grow. And it's still below kind of prepandemic levels. China is the place,
obviously, everybody has been paying attention to. Domestic travel up to nearly 90% of pre-COVID.
Flights in and out of the country still well below that. And we see flights being scheduled. You see
indicators that suggest travel will grow. You listen to the airlines and that certainly seems to be what they
anticipate, but that's in progress. So that's a kind of a quick look across the product slate. I think margins
reflect a couple of things.
One, a year ago, we were in a period of recovering economies and we're coming out of a period of
rationalizing refining capacity around the world. And you can go to any part of the world and find refineries
that had shut down that perhaps people expected would close one day, but it happened relatively quickly.
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
And at the same time, you saw big growth projects that had been deferred because of the uncertainty
relative to COVID. A year later here, you don't see refineries closing at the same rate. We've seen refinery
startups in the Middle East.
We've seen projects here in the U.S. and in Asia as well. So refining capacity coming into the system
demand has moderated a little bit. Margins have come down. They're still stronger than historic margins
if you look out over a longer period of time, but trending back down towards mid-cycle. Pretty strong in
the U.S., maybe under a little more pressure in Asia, but you got to think about the feedstocks in Asia,
where they're coming from, how they're priced and how those markets are working. So I don't see any big
warning signs flashing, but certainly, we're paying close attention to it.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
And then maybe sticking with the downstream, and you mentioned California. Can you just talk about the
new regulations in California around the potential for excess profit penalties, not sure if that's exactly how
to refer to it. But how much does that impact how you think about refining in California and your position
in California and maybe the expected impacts on the broader market there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll talk about it, sure. So the bottom line is this is now into a rule-making process. There's no impact
right now and it's into kind of a bureaucratic phase. I think implementation is likely to take quite a while,
and it's hard to say exactly how it plays out. What started as an effort to create a windfall profits tax
was unsuccessful because you need 2/3 of a vote in the legislature for new tax in California. That then
modified into some other forms and ended up moving into the Energy Commission, where there will be a
group established that will gather a lot of data and try to assess the profitability of industry against some
standard, which I think is yet to be fully articulated.
So this is going to take some time. It could potentially result in some sort of a fine or a penalty for
margins or profits above a level, but I can't tell you how it's going to play out because it's -- there's a lot
of work to be done there. I guess the things that I would say are pretty predictable are maybe 2. One,
there are substantial new reporting requirements, and there's a lot of data we're going to have to produce.
We're happy to do that. We'll work closely with the Energy Commission to make sure we get them the
information that they're requesting. And then the second is, I don't think this does anything to encourage
investment or new supply, which is really what's needed in a marketplace commodity markets to bring
prices down on average over time.
In fact, I think it runs the risk of doing the opposite of discouraging investment, of decreasing supply over
time, which if demand does not moderate, will tend to exacerbate volatility and over time probably result
in, on average, higher levels of price. So that's about all I know about it at this point, and we'll watch it as
it unfolds.

We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine
BofA Securities, Research Division
This is Kalei on for Doug. The first one is on the new Permian disclosure. So you guys are forecasting flat
royalty volumes. So I'm wondering, as that becomes a smaller part of the production mix, how is the cash
margin from that asset affected going forward?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, royalty barrels have essentially an infinite margin. And so I think if you and Doug can do the math
as it's a slightly lower percentage than that will be a part offset, but there's lots of other drivers that we're

doing to enhance margins. And we've shown return on capital employed near 30% at $60 Brent equivalent
for our premium. So it's a high-return low-carbon asset and the royalty barrels, as you know, come with
virtually no cost, and that's part of the advantage that we have.
Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine
BofA Securities, Research Division
Understood. I appreciate that, Pierre. My second question goes to TCO. Just wondering if we can get an
update on timing of first oil from the new expansion projects and the dividend magnitude for 2023.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the expansion project, as I said, there's a lot of turnarounds in activity, both this year and next
year. And at our Investor Day, we laid out a bar chart that gave you an idea on production. The real I
think the time, as I said earlier, when you're going to see the production growth will manifest itself in 2024
because the next 2 years, we've got a lot of these turnarounds, ties-ins, et cetera, in place. So Pierre, you
can guide on dividends.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
No change in our affiliate dividend guidance that we shared on the last call of $5 billion to $6 billion for the
full year. That includes Tengiz and our other affiliates. We expect, like last year, a dividend in the second
quarter that will be modest and then a larger dividend in the fourth quarter. TCO continues to hold more
cash on its balance sheet to manage through both completing uncertainty around the project and around
transport alternatives. But that cash will come back over time. It's been performing very well. But we
don't give specifics on that by year. It's embedded in our overall affiliate dividend guidance.
Kaleinoheaokealaula Scott Akamine
BofA Securities, Research Division
I appreciate that there's still some turnarounds to work through. But as the production hit a steady state,
what do you expect the dividend cadence to look like?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
So as I said, last year, there was in 2 quarters. This year, again, it will be second quarter and fourth
quarter, and we'll just -- it's up to the TCO Board of Directors to make dividend decisions going forward.

Just curious about the pace of rig activity in the Permian. You guys are adding one per quarter this year
[indiscernible] to be to support growth next year. I'm just curious, as you continue looking forward into
next year, do you need to add 4 more rigs next year to keep kind of that 10% growth pace? Is it less
because you're getting more efficient in the Delaware production? I'm just curious how you're thinking
about the step-up in activity going forward.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean we've pulled rigs down dramatically in 2020, and we didn't want to surge back with
everything all at once. And so we entered this year with 10. We expect to exit this year with 14 co-op
rigs running. And I think consistent with the longer-term production profile that we've outlined, we got
a big base business that does have decline underneath it. And so you're going to expect us to add some
additional rigs as we move into '24.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
Josh Silverstein
Got it. And I know there's a lot of activity stepping up across the rest of the kind of Lower 48, Haynesville,
DJ. They're a little bit more on the gassier side. I'm curious if you guys are pulling back any activity
because they're a little bit more gas prone in this price environment.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We've -- we're adding a rig in the Haynesville. We talked about that for a number of years building up to
that activity. Gas prices are going to be volatile. And frankly, we need to get developing that resource. We
have some offset operators. And so if we don't get after it, it's the time for us to do that. The DJ still has a
heavy liquids component, no change in our plans. In fact, the DJ and Argentina are a couple of other areas
where we expect production in the second half of the year to be higher where we're increasing a little bit
of activity. And again, all of that is within our existing CapEx budget.
Operator
We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Maybe first off, just a quick follow-up on the comments earlier on and the question on trading, in the
international downstream, your earnings were particularly strong this quarter. And I think in the slides
there, there's a $270 million other bar, positive other bar in chart there. Is that primarily trading? And
anything to read on that going forward? Is that something that likely reverses or maybe some clarity
there?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
You're right. We referred to it. I would not say it's primarily. It's a lot of factors and we pointed out to that.
It's consistent with how Mike described our trading business. And as all trading businesses are, it can be
variable in future quarters. So it's just one of many factors. It's not primarily, but we wanted to cite it as
one of the elements in that other variance.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
And then maybe on the Permian, if you look back at the Permian, you've also -- you obviously talked and
at the Analyst Day, you talked about a variety of the shifts in the 2023 development plan versus 2022. I
think -- and you highlighted some more here today. I think we appreciate some of the near-term impacts.
Can you talk at all to what some of the longer-term implications are of the shift to more single-bench
development adjustments to pacing more shift towards New Mexico, et cetera. Does it have any impact
on -- like does the move to increased single-bench development have any impact on the productivity or
recovery of other zones in the area?
Does it change at all how you think about service infrastructure and logistics, how you think about
resource depth in different parts of the portfolio over the long term?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Ryan, I would say not really. We've always been return seeking. And so this is all about optimizing
the return we can get out of this asset over the long haul. We've tried to be thoughtful about surface
infrastructure. We've tried to be thoughtful about drilling to keep surface infrastructure fully utilized, not
over building it for peaks and then leaving it underutilized for long periods of time.
And as we're continuing to learn, the fundamental principles about optimizing return on investment
continue to drive all of this activity. So as we learn more about benches, about communication, about

productivity, as technology changes recovery factors, we will continue to apply all of those learnings. But
the real objective remains the same. It's not volume, it's value and returns.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Ryan, and just as a reminder, the move to more single bench is in the Delaware Basin, right? Midland
Basin 3/4 is multi-bench development.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with TD Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division
Sorry to go back to the Permian, but I'm going to ask another. I was wondering and I appreciate all
the disclosures. They're really helpful. But in terms of the non-op component of production, does the
proportion stay relatively stable through your forecast period? I think you gave a forecast out to 2027
at the Analyst Day. Does the non-op proportion stay the same? Or do you have more operational barrels
between now and '27?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
It stays relatively similar, I would say, Jason. We can provide further insights on that as well. There's not
a big shift. We're growing activity. As I mentioned earlier, we're adding rigs and you got a pretty big base
you're adding in on top of. So those percentages don't move a lot.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division
All right. That's helpful. And then just one accounting question. Depreciation fell decently quarter-over-
quarter in upstream. What was that related to?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Are you looking at it excluding special items? Or...
Jason Daniel Gabelman
TD Cowen, Research Division
Yes. If I look at the quarter-over-quarter Slide 7, upstream DD&A was positive $345 million.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, why don't you follow up with Jake? That could be tied to some exploration activity.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I wanted to ask about Namibia. You recently farmed in a few months ago. Could you just walk me
through plans for the next 12 months or so what you've got penciled in? And then I've got a follow-up on
something else.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
Sure. So we've completed seismic acquisition in Namibia at the end of February, and that's being
processed right now. And so I can't really comment any further on that. We certainly are mindful of others
who have had certain exploration success in the region, which is encouraging, but we need to do the work
on that and then determine what the next steps are, which can include drilling exploration wells. So stay
tuned on that as we got more information, we'll share it with you, Raj.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Okay. And then just on a different topic, cost inflation because more and more, you hear some of the
service providers talking about improving pricing and so on. So could you just comment on your latest
thoughts and what you're seeing on the cost inflation side outside of the Lower 48?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So really no change to our mid-single-digit inflation guidance in our current year capital spending.
As you note, in the Lower 48, there are some areas where we planned for higher inflation and we're seeing
that. I'll remind you that a lot of what we do in our procurement activities are longer-term contracts that
are either fixed priced or index-based.
We've got detailed cost models to challenge price increases. We commit volumes to certain things over
longer periods of time to try to create a win-win between us and our suppliers. And so we've not seen
some of the cost push-through that you would see if you were buying services or commodities inputs on a
spot basis or then current basis because we manage that activity differently.
For instance, on offshore rigs, we're fully contracted for this year. We came into the year with 3 rigs
working in the Gulf of Mexico. They're generally below current market rates. And so I think we're
managing this well. The one thing I would say is given these kind of index-based contracts, there are
periodic reviews where we will reset based on market indicators.
And so in the second quarter in certain parts of our business, we'll be going through this with some of
our partners, and we'll see some resets on there that will probably reflect a little bit of the inflation that I
referred to earlier that's already built into our plans. But I think we're managing all that within the range
that is embedded in the guidance we've given you.
Operator
We'll take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Unknown Analyst
This is Patrick [indiscernible] on behalf of Neal Dingmann. For my question, it's with respect to Venezuelan
exports. I know previously, you made mentioned of really no further capital investments in Venezuela.
What we're curious to know is, is there a maximum threshold of exports and sales that you're anticipating
out of Venezuela?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Is there a maximum -- I mean, it's limited by our position there and the entities that we're involved in and
what our portion of that production that we're entitled to market is. We're currently seeing about 100,000
barrels a day of production up from about 50,000 when the license terms changed. That can go up further
this year, maybe another 50% if everything goes well. The crude comes to the U.S., and we're finding a
market for the crude. And yes, it's a 6-month license from OPEC, and we have to bear that in mind. So
that's why we are proceeding, as you said, which is we've got some past receivables that are being paid
from some of these proceeds and there's a lot of relatively straightforward workover and other activity
that can help bring production up at -- without major capital commitments.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2023 EARNINGS CALL | APR 28, 2023
And so that's the current model. We'll see how things unfold and hopefully pointed in a good direction, but
it's been a bit of an up and down situation, and we have to -- we just have to take this one step at a time.
Unknown Analyst
Good stuff there. I guess just as a follow-up, would there be -- are you exploring -- that 6-month term,
are you looking to extend that at all? Or is it too early to be negotiated?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
That's a decision made by the U.S. Government. It's not really a negotiation. It's their decision, and
it's a policy matter. We're asked for input and so we provide input on these things. But for the last
several years, these things have had relatively short time lines associated with them. And so we're in full
compliance with all the conditions of the sanctions and intend to stay that way. And we'll just see how the
policy making turns out.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
This is Pierre. I'm going to go back to Jason's question. So yes, lower depreciation is really 3 drivers.
Some of it was the absence of some abandonment accruals that were in the fourth quarter. So you can
view those as sort of nonrecurring. And then some of it is due to new rates. So each year, we revised our
depreciation rates based on additions to proved reserves, and those rates are a little bit lower.
And then, of course, first quarter production was a little bit lower than fourth quarter production. So lower
volumes also contributed to that lower depreciation.
Jake Spiering
I would like to thank everyone for your time today. We appreciate your interest in Chevron and your

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Roderick Green, General Manager of Investor Relations; our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO,
Pierre Breber, are on the call with me.
Also listening in today is Jake Spiering, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will
assume this position effective March 1. Jake and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of
months. It's been my sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last 2 years. Thank you for your
questions, feedback and investment in Chevron.
We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website. Before we begin,
please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking
statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. Now I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Chevron had an outstanding year in
2022, delivering record financial performance, producing more traditional energy and advancing lower
carbon businesses.
Free cash flow stood a record, beating our previous high in 2021 by more than $15 billion, enabling a
strong dividend increase and the buyback of almost 4% of our shares.
U.S. production was also our highest ever led by double-digit growth in the Permian. Growth matters when
it's profitable. Return on capital employed over 20% shows that our focus on capital efficiency is delivering
results.
And we took important steps in building new energy businesses. We successfully integrated REG's people
and assets into Chevron, combining the best of both companies' technical and commercial capabilities.
And we acquired rights to pore space for potential carbon capture and storage projects in Texas and
Australia.
We had many other highlights last year, to name just a few, at TCO, project construction is largely
complete, and we're starting up the fuel gas system. Focus is on commissioning and start-up of the
Wellhead Pressure Management Project by the end of this year to begin transition of the field from high to
low pressure.
We announced a significant new gas discovery offshore Egypt, which could build on our growing natural
gas position in the Eastern Med.
And our affiliate CPChem reached FID for 2 world-scale ethylene and derivative projects in Texas and
Qatar.
2022 was a dynamic year with unique macroeconomic and geopolitical forces disrupting economies and
industries around the globe. These events remind us of the importance of affordable and reliable energy
with a lower carbon intensity over time.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
We don't know what's ahead in 2023. I do know that Chevron's approach will be clear and consistent,
focused on capital, cost and operational discipline with the objective to safely deliver higher returns and
lower carbon. With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We reported fourth quarter earnings of $6.4 billion or $3.33 per share. Adjusted earnings
were $7.9 billion or $4.09 per share. Included in the quarter were $1.1 billion in write-offs and
impairments in our international upstream segment, and negative foreign currency effects over $400
million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Record operating cash flows in combination with continued capital efficiency, resulted in over $37 billion of
free cash flow in 2022. The only other year Chevron's operating cash flow exceeded $40 billion was 2011.
Free cash flow in that year was less than 40% of this year's record.
In 2022, Chevron delivered outstanding results on all 4 of its financial priorities. Announcing earlier this
week another 6% increase in our dividend per share, positioning 2023 to be the 36th consecutive year
with annual dividend payout increases, investing within its organic budget despite cost inflation. Inorganic
CapEx totaled $1.3 billion nearly 80% for new energy investments.
Paying down debt in every quarter and ending the year with a 3% net debt ratio, returning record annual
cash to shareholders through buybacks and exiting the year with an annual repurchase rate of $15 billion.
Two days ago, Chevron's Board of Directors authorized a new $75 billion share repurchase program. Now
is a good time to look back on our execution of the prior programs. Over the past nearly 2 decades, we
bought back shares in more than 3 out of every 4 years, returning more than $65 billion to shareholders.
And we've done it below the market average price during the whole time period.
Going forward with the new program, our intent is the same, be a steady buyer of our shares across
commodity cycles. With a breakeven Brent price around $50 per barrel to cover our CapEx and dividend
and with excess balance sheet capacity, we're positioned to return more cash to shareholders in any
reasonable oil price scenario.
Turning to the quarter. Adjusted earnings were down nearly $3 billion compared with last quarter. Adjusted
upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower realizations and liftings as well as higher exploration
expense, partially offset by favorable timing effects. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on
lower refining and chemicals margins and negative timing effects partially offset with higher sales volumes
following third quarter turnarounds.
The Other segment charges increased mainly due to accruals for stock-based compensation.
For the full year, adjusted earnings increased more than $20 billion compared to the prior year. Adjusted
upstream earnings were up primarily due to increased realizations. Other items include higher exploration
expenses, higher incremental royalties and production taxes due to higher prices, partially offset by
favorable tax benefits and other items.
Downstream adjusted earnings increased primarily due to higher refining margins, partially offset by lower
chemical earnings and higher maintenance and turnaround costs.
2022 production was in line with guidance after adjusting for higher prices. As a reminder, Chevron's share
of production is lower under certain international contracts when actual prices are higher than assumed in
our guidance. Reserves replacement ratio was nearly 100% with the largest net additions in the Permian,
Israel, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. Higher prices lowered our share of proved reserves by over 100
million barrels of oil equivalent.
2023 production is expected to be flat to up 3% at $80 Brent. After adjusting for lower prices and portfolio
changes, primarily the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and the expiration of a contract in Thailand, we expect
production to grow led by the Permian and other shale and tight assets. We remain confident in exceeding
our long-term production guidance.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
Looking ahead to 2023, I'll call out a few items. Earnings estimates from first quarter refinery turnarounds
are mostly driven by El Segundo. Based on the current outlook, we expect higher natural gas costs for
our California refineries. Full year guidance for all other segment losses is lower this year due to higher
expected interest income and again excludes special items such as pension settlement costs.
The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We estimate annual affiliate
dividends between $5 billion and $6 billion, depending primarily on commodity prices and margins. The
difference between affiliate earnings and dividends is expected to be less than $2 billion. We do not expect
a dividend from TCO in the first quarter.
We updated our earnings sensitivities. About 20% of the Brent sensitivity relates to oil-linked LNG sales.
Also, we expect to maintain share buybacks at the top end of our guidance range during the first quarter.
Finally, as a reminder in Venezuela, we use cost affiliate accounting, which means we will only record
earnings if we receive cash. We do not record production or reserves.
2022 was a record year for Chevron in many ways. We look forward to the future, confident in our
strategy with a consistent objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon. We'll share more
during our Investor Day next month. Back to you, Roderick.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
That concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take your questions. Please try to limit
yourself to one question and one follow-up. We'll do our best to get all your questions answered. Katie,

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
We'd like to wish Roderick well in his new position, and we really appreciate all your time and help over
the past 2 years. So thank you very much.
Our first question, maybe just heading towards the buyback authorization topic. This week, the Board
authorized the buyback authorization up to $75 billion, no expiration date, which is pretty large versus the
prior authorization that had a 4-year expiration date. We heard your comments on wanting to be a steady
buyer of your shares across cycles and that you're positioned to return more cash to shareholders. Can
you comment on the decision-making process for getting to that $75 billion and maybe the choice to leave
the authorization open in timing versus the prior authorization did have an expiration date?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jeanine, let me start, and then I'll have Pierre add a little bit of color. We included a little information
on this call looking back at our past programs. And as you saw on the Slide 15 and the last 19 years,
we've bought shares back lower than the market volume weighted average over that period of time.
We look at the decision going forward in the context of the cash-generating potential of the portfolio,
the outlook for the market environment, the strength of the balance sheet. And we don't want to be
authorizing a program every year. So we talk to the Board about a multiyear outlook.
So the fact that there's not an end date on it is only significant if you're trying to do some sort of math
and annualize this. We think our track record speaks for ourselves and the steady, consistent way that
we've done this. And so we increased the rate 3 times last year as we saw the situation evolve, and we're
now at an all-time high with the rate of repurchases. So the last thing you said it, but I'll repeat it, in sized
to maintain our program through the commodity cycle. We aren't pro-cyclical. We're not countercyclical.
We're steady through the cycle, and that is the intention. Pierre, do you want to add anything?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Jeanine. So the authorization from 2019 was going to be consumed in the second quarter. It was
also open. So it did not have a defined time period. We just -- will have consumed it. So instead of having
an authorization in the middle of the quarter, we'll complete this quarter's buybacks under the 2019
authorization, which again had an open time period, and then we'll start the new on April 1. So it is similar
to the way it was done in the prior time.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Thank you for that clarification. We appreciate that. Maybe our second question, it's that time of year
again, reserve replacement ratio, your ratio for 2022 was 97%. And we believe that compared to 112%
last year, and then I think it was around 99% on average for the 5 years before that. So our question
for you is just -- how do you see this ratio trending over time? And I guess the over or under bogey is
probably 100%.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
Yes. So it can move in any given year, Jeanine for a whole host of reasons, right? Prices, FID decisions,
portfolio actions that we take to either sell or buy. And so the 1-year number is one that will move around.
The longer cycle numbers, the one that you ought to pay attention to.
Remember also, as we have this large position in the Permian we continue to develop. We can only book
5 years forward. And so each year, we'll produce out of the unconventional assets, and we'll add another
year's worth of reserves on the back end of that. And so if you were to look at the Permian unconstrained
by that, you'd have a very different view. This year, we had some additions in the Permian and Israel and
Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, as Pierre mentioned, the largest net reduction this year were Kazakhstan
due to the contract terms and the effect of higher prices.
If you were to actually adjust that out, so we mentioned 100 million barrels where the price effect this
year would be -- think of it as 107% ex the price effect. And so I do think over time, we intend to be
in this business for quite a while and 100% is a number that you ought to expect to see that or greater
over time. But in any given year or any short number of years, you might see something looks a little bit
different.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
First of all, Roderick, I wanted to [indiscernible] Jeanine, congrats on the new role, and thank you for all
the help over the years. It's been great working with you.
So I wanted to focus in on upstream. And it's good to see the continued progress on TCO and exciting
to be getting close to the finish line on the expansion project there. You noted that WPMP is on track
for commissioning and start-up later this year. I just wanted to first confirm that the second part of that
expansion, FGP is still on track for '24. And then just stepping back, can you just walk us through your
latest expectations to the impacts on both TCO production, CapEx and then also affiliate dividends as
these projects come online. Trying to get a sense of the changes in '24 versus '23? And then also how you
think about the run rate on both volumes and spending for that affiliate post FGP?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Devin, I'll talk to the project and let Pierre talk a little bit to the financials. First of all, no change to
cost or schedule guidance. WPMP is trending toward a beginning start-up by the end of this year. We've
got a lot of work done. We've got a new power grid up and running, and this was a power grid built
back in the Soviet days. The control room is up and running, where everything comes into one central
control room. All the production on gas injection wells are done, the gas injection facility is now in early
commissioning. In just the next few days, we'll tie in the fuel gas system to the first gas turbine generator,
which is really an important milestone to test the first of the 3 GTGs, begin the process of powering up
electrical generation capacity and commissioning boilers, steam and other utilities.
So that all happens sequentially here over the next period of time which leads to commissioning the
pressure boost compressors in the third quarter and then converting the field from -- beginning the
conversion from high to low pressure by the end of the year.
A couple of things that will bear on production. We've got 2 planned turnarounds of the old processing
trains. They're called the KTL. There's 5 of them. We had 2 turnarounds this year that are planned in the
third quarter. So those will be down for a period of time. And then as those come back up, production may
not fully recover on those 2 as some of the wells won't resume flowing until we get to the low-pressure
system.
So back half of the year, you'll see a little bit of that impact. And then as we move into '24, we've got
more of these high pressure to low-pressure conversions in the field and we've got FGP start-up first half

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
of '24. So you don't see the full effect of FGP roll through, you get partial effect in ramping in '24, and
then the full effect will show in '25. Cash will kind of follow that pattern. So Pierre, maybe you can talk
about the pattern on CapEx and dividends.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. For 2023, the TCO dividends are included in the guidance we provided, $5 billion, $6 billion, which
is up from what our total dividends that we received last year. We did indicate that TCO has held a little
excess cash during the course of last year just due to uncertainties that are going on right now.
The CapEx was included in our December release. So it's nearly half of the $3 billion of affiliate CapEx, so
that's $1.5 billion. Again, you'd expect that to continue to roll off next year. And then if you go back to our
Investor Day, we showed that at $60 Brent post start-up in a full year of FGP production that the free cash
flow coming out of TCO on 100% basis would be $10 billion. And again, that's a $60 Brent. We'll provide
further updates as we normally do on Investor Day. But the takeaway, as we've said for a long time, now
we've been investing in this project for 6+ years through COVID, through the ups and downs, when it
starts up, it will generate a lot of free cash flow. We'll see that in the form of dividends, and we'll see that
in the form of paying back some of the loans that we co-lend into TCO.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Devin, just to kind of put a final punctuation on that. In our Investor Day last year, we showed in 2026, so
once we get fully on the other side of all this stuff I just described, a 5x expansion in free cash flow out of
TCO versus 2021. So it's meaningful.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. Great. A helpful answer there. And then thinking about this year, 2023 in more detail. You talked
about 0% to 3% total production growth for the year, led by sale in the Permian. And last year, you had
another strong one for the Permian, volumes were up 16%. I was wondering if you could just talk through
your expectations for that asset in 2023, whether or not you're adding rigs there, overall activity trends?
And then more broadly within that 0% to 3% range, what are some of the drivers that can be viewed to
the upper or lower end as we move through the year.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Maybe I'll finish on -- I think the second question is about overall production, and the first was about
Permian. So our outlook for 2023 at $80 is flat to up 3%, so that post between 3 million and 3.1 million
barrels a day. There's a modest adjustment to that relative to our Investor Day guidance. A couple of
things driving that, some project deferrals like Mad Dog 2, which we thought would start up in '22 and
now looks like a '23 startup.
We've got some downtime, plans downtime that shifted from '22 to '23. And then our Permian growth
would be a little bit lower in '23. A couple of things. One, in '22, we had the benefit of a lot of prior DUCs
that had been sitting that came online and it boost early production in '22, a little bit more. And then
we also are re-optimizing some of our development plans to factor in some of the things we continue to
learn relative to interactions between wells and benches, how we space laterals and do single or multi-
bench development. So our revised plan will have some deeper targets, a few more rig moves and a few
more single bench developments all of which brings that pace down a little bit. So that's kind of at the
highest level, what is behind the production numbers. We'll talk about that more when we see you guys in
a month here. And maybe I'll stop there because I did cover the Permian as part of that.
Katie, we can go to the next question.
Katie, can you hear us?

We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Congrats here on a good year. Mike, I guess the first question I have for you is around global gas. And
maybe you can talk about how you're seeing the market. There's obviously been a tremendous amount of
volatility and remind us again how you're positioned from a contracted versus spot position? And then I
have a follow-up on gas as well in the Eastern Med.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, high level, we certainly have seen a very unusual and volatile year in '22, which has settled
out here as we've come into the winter, primarily as we've seen a bit milder winter in the northern
hemisphere than is typical. And as in Europe, the successful build of inventories for this year and the
reduction of industrial demand have both resulted in an outlook that is less dire for the European
economies, then it may have looked like several months ago.
And so I think the market reflects all of that. You also have the fact that China has been -- the economy
has been slow throughout the year, which is -- looks to be turning around. And so I think it's good that
markets have calmed. I mean the high prices really were creating a lot of stresses out there that are not
good. And I hope we see these prices stay in a more moderate range as we enter 2023.
Our posture is largely as we've described it before, we're primarily contracted on oil index pricing, biggest
piece, obviously, out of Australia. We do have -- we ran really well in Australia last year, a record number
of cargoes and so there were some spot cargoes in the mix out of Australia, out of West Africa, we've got
a little more spot exposure in Angola and now with Equatorial Guinea as well. But think of us as primarily
oil-linked. And we've got some sensitivities, I think that Pierre has put out there, and we've reiterated
some of those in the guidance today that should help you model these things based on your assumptions
on gas prices.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
And that's the follow-up. You have a large gas position in the Eastern Mediterranean following the noble
acquisition with Leviathan and Tamar and some discoveries out there as well. So how do you think about
prosecuting that asset? Where does it fall in terms of prioritization? And how big can it be?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. It's a high priority. We took FID at the end of last year on a project to expand Tamar from -- on
a 100% basis, 1.1 to 1.6 Bcf per day. The first gas on that should come online in early 2025. We are
working on development options to expand Leviathan. Those are still being worked and we should narrow
the concepts on that later this year and reach some decisions in terms of how we intend to do that.
The Norgas discovery, it's just one well at this point, but it encountered a significant section of high-
quality gas-bearing sandstone. So very attractive. We're talking to our partner there about appraisal and
development concepts that will follow. So that region -- and of course, we've got a number of additional
exploration blocks further to the west in the Mediterranean that we've not yet put any wells into but we've
got seismic and we're developing our exploration plans and you'll hear more about that as we go forward.
So it's a high priority. The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously
options to try to get that gas into Europe. And so the noble acquisition was really advantageous from that
standpoint, and we're optimistic about the prospectivity of some of these additional exploration blocks.

We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Roderick, I'd like to also pass on my thanks. You've transformed Chevron and those Investor Relations.
Thank you for all your help.
Guys, I wonder if I could go back to the buyback. I just want to try and understand a little bit about the
comment around really just how you think about the purpose of the buyback. Is this really about dividend
management at this point? Because it seems to us that if you take your Brent sensitivity into account,
the run rate at the high end of the range puts you about a $90 breakeven on your oil price. And I'm just
wondering if this is about value or about managing confidence in future dividend growth.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, let me try to be clear on this, Doug. We do not do buybacks to manage dividends. Dividend --
absolute dividend load is an outcome. It's not a reason that you would do buybacks. Our dividend growth
expresses confidence in the ability to grow free cash flow at mid-cycle prices, and it is a long-term
decision, a long, long, long-term decision. We haven't cut the dividend since the great depression. Pierre
mentioned, we've increased the payout 36 years in a row now.
Buybacks are different. They signal confidence that we're going to generate excess free cash flow, where
we've got excess balance sheet capacity, which we have significant capacity in the current commodity
cycle. And as we satisfy our commitments on the dividend, our reinvestment plans in a disciplined manner
to grow free cash flows and maintain that strong balance sheet, we've got the capacity then to buy shares
back through the cycle. An outcome of buybacks is a lower absolute dividend, but it's not the driver.
And so I don't want -- there should be no confusion about that. We've got confidence in our dividend
increases, whether we're buying shares back or not. We wouldn't increase the dividend if we didn't have
that confidence. And so the 2 are not linked in that manner.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
That's very clear. My follow-up is a bit unfair given your Analyst Day is a month away, but I'm going to
give this a go anyway. But -- so if you made the point in your balance sheet is in terrific shape, obviously.
You've got a lot of capacity there. But also, if I go back to that. let's say the $90 breakeven, all I'm doing
is taking that $15 billion run rate, $400 million a year and adding it to the $50 breakeven -- $90. What
does that say about your outlook for maybe stepping up growth capital?
That would seem to imply that the growth capital of the $17 billion CapEx number is probably what we
should expect going forward. Is that the right way to think about it? Or should we wait until the end of the
month or the end of February?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, we'll talk about it more in February. I'm not sure I followed all your math there, but we're
growing. We had a 3% compound annual growth rate at $15 billion to $17 billion of CapEx in a market
that's not growing that fast. We're growing well better than the overall demand for oil or for gas, which is
growing faster than oil is. And so we are growing production, but what we're really focused on is growing
returns and cash flow.
And if we can grow returns and cash flow, the equation works. And so I -- we'll be happy to talk about
this more when we're together at the end of the month, but -- or at the end of next month. But we can
grow cash flow, we can improve returns at the rate that we're spending at. And so I don't know why
there would be a questions about our ability to do that and the production numbers and outcome of those
decisions. It's not the goal.

We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So maybe just kind of a spin on Doug's question. So with the balance sheet at 3%, is there a point where
you think of yourself is actually underlevered and I realize that's a good problem to have. But if you ever
got to that point with the mechanism be to get leverage higher by increasing the buyback? Or how do you
think about that generally is the 3% kind of where you want to be?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
This is Pierre. I'll take that. Our guidance is for the net debt ratio to be between 20% and 25% and
mid-cycle conditions. And as you said, we're at 3%, so we're much stronger than that. And that's what
happens in the short term. So Mike has talked about our financial priorities. They're simple. We've been
consistent with them for a very long time. And 3 of the 4 are pegged. We just increased our dividend 6%.
We have a 23 CapEx budget of $14 billion. We've given guidance that keeps that CapEx flat over the next
several years. And we have the buybacks at the top end of the guidance range of $15 billion.
So swings in cash flow in the short term, will go to the balance sheet. And that's because commodity
prices and margins, we just were talking about natural gas prices and refining margins and things are
moving up and down. But over the long term, those cash flows will be returned to shareholders. And so we
want to do it in a way that is steady across the cycle. As Mike said, we don't want to be pro-cyclical. And
by the way, we haven't, right? Our track record shows that over the past nearly 2 decades that we've been
able to buy actually below what the market average price has been.
So the intent is to, yes, we'll be a little strong balance sheet depending on commodity prices and margins
and how strong our operations have been. But then over time, the cycle will correct and then we'll
continue buying back shares. We've said we could have a higher buyback rate right now. We're sizing it at
a level to maintain it for multiple years across the cycle. That means there'll be a time period where we'll
be buying back shares off the balance sheet, and we'll lever back up closer to that 20% to 25% guidance.
Thanks, John.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Very clear. And just a follow-up on the TCO project. I was hoping you could give an update on the CPC
terminal operationally and kind of where that stands? And then what type of discounts are you seeing at
that terminal right now? I think you called out a few quarters ago or maybe 2 quarters ago that it was $6
or $7 per barrel. I imagine that's come in a bit. So where is that discount today? And how is that terminal
operating.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So last year, there was probably more news than there was impact on a variety of issues relative to
the pipeline and the terminal. There was work going on in the kind of late third and into the fourth quarter
on the 2 of the 3 single point moorings. All that work is done. All 3 SPMs are operational today. There are
no constraints on loading. There are no constraints on throughput on the pipe.
Despite a lot of the things that people heard and worried about last year, the pipeline was very reliable.
Our production was impacted less than 10,000 barrels a day over the course of the year. It was only a few
weeks in March and April. And so everything there is running very smoothly now, and we don't see any
constraints.
Discounts have come in a little bit on CPC. In the immediate aftermath of some of the sanctions and
changes related to Ukraine. We saw a trading range that was like $4 to $10 below dated Brent. And before

the conflict began, it was plus or minus $1. We're seeing kind of $1 to $3 discounts now. So maybe not
quite at pre-invasion levels but not as deep as they were immediately afterwards. And given the overall
flat price environment and the way it has strengthened the impact to [ CCO ] is relatively muted.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just looking at, let's call it, refined product demand. You talked about gas demand earlier. I'm just
curious, as you look around the world, we've got positives moving away from COVID on a year-over-year
comparison and then everybody's got high expectations for the China reopening. I was just curious, as
you look across your operating base, what you're seeing there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Overall, Roger, gasoline demand, I'll start there. Still just a touch below pre-pandemic levels, fourth
quarter of '22 maybe 2% or 3% below fourth quarter of '19. If you look at diesel, demand is pretty flat
versus pre-pandemic. Jet recovering, but still below and so at the highest level, we're kind of still flattish
to recovering from pre-Covid. I think that's why there is concern that as China's economy really does
come through and return to a more normal level, that we could see increased demand start to pull on
these markets again.
You've seen announcements out of China about their intention. We see international flights and air travel
now being scheduled at much higher levels than we've seen before long. And if you see the kind of
rebound spending and activity in that economy that we've seen in other economies around the world,
that's one of the things that could [ boid ] the global economy and firm up demand for products.
So there's still some variables in the equation. We're not past the risk of recession and clearly, central
banks are still tightening to slow things in certain parts of the world. So there's some puts and takes. But
net-net, this continues to trend in a recovering direction with the 2 biggest questions probably related to
the 2 biggest economies, China and the U.S.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Always the big guys, right? A follow-up question to come back to the Permian, and I recognize the
Investor Day coming. But Pierre, when we were at the sell-side dinner end of November, there was a lot
of discussion over kind of the changing in the range and how that was really just a function of messaging
more so than overall change in the way you're developing the Permian, kind of following from that to the
comments about things a little different in the bench and the DUC comparisons year-over-year. You look at
it as any different from the messaging at the end of November? Or is this -- is there something else here
with.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
No, nothing different. We'll show that at our Investor Day. Again, we were in the middle of the range. You
can see the fourth quarter number was 738. So that was strong. We had some learnings, as Mike said,
in 2022, and we've adjusted our plans to go to deeper targets and more single bench developments and
that results in a little longer drilling times and a few more rig moves and we'll update all that. And all that
is obviously included in our production guidance. So we'll continue to learn and adapt in the Permian. It's
a large royalty advantage position. It's an asset that delivers higher returns and lower carbon. It's a big
source of free cash flow.
Our free cash flow growth over the next 5 years is really driven by Permian, Tengiz, Gulf of Mexico, a
few other assets. And it's remarkable to have an asset that can grow at that rate and do it free cash flow

positive the whole time and free cash flow growing the whole time. So it will ebb and flow a little bit as
we learn more, but what you'll see at our Investor Day, something very consistent with what we're saying
today and what we said in the past.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
And Roger, just to emphasize the point I made earlier to another one of the questions, we remain focused
on returns and value, not on production. And so that is the -- that's what drives all of this. Thanks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe General.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
Thank you very much for taking my questions which are both related. So I will ask both at the same time.
So firstly, thinking about balance sheet strength, of course, the other use it can be put to is M&A. You've
been very disciplined with your M&A timings, both with Noble and REGI. How do you see the current
market in these 2, let's say, [ POTS ] legacy oil and gas versus low carbon. And then secondly, has the IRA
Act perhaps changed your appetite for faster expansion in low carbon businesses, please?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Irene. So we do have the capacity to do M&A. We don't need to do M&A. And so we'll only do
deals that are value-creating deals. You interestingly contrast the traditional oil and gas market with the
new energies market. What I would observe is given commodity price strength in oil and gas, we've seen
companies that previously might have been languishing from a value standpoint, strengthen. And I think
there's some optimism in the eyes of other companies about the future. And so the bid asks read on oil
and gas companies is maybe a little wider right now given the strength versus when we did our deal a
couple of years ago.
In lower carbon, with interest rates rising and specs kind of receding and the like. A little bit of the kind of
froth may have come out of that market, but there are still some optimism in valuations there as well. And
so we'll be very thoughtful and careful as we evaluate those. And there are a lot of companies out there
that have got business models in this space. So we watch them all. We will be back to talk to you if we
have anything that's interesting.
Let me touch on IRA and then ask Pierre to add a little more color. The IRA will probably accelerate some
activity in the U.S. There's no doubt. Hopefully, what that does is it allows technologies to be derisked.
The cost of technologies to be reduced and the attractiveness of these investments to improve. A bill like
that with all kind of a grab bag of different policy incentives doesn't necessarily change our long-term
view on how we want to build businesses. It does perhaps change the trajectory at which some of those
businesses become more economically viable. And if that's the case, that could feed through into our
similar investment decision. But it's kind of a second order effect rather than a first order effect.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And just to add some of the other important effects, permitting really critical for traditional energy,
super critical for new energy, new technology developments. You've seen us make some investments on
technology to reduce the cost of capture of CO2 and then scale, getting cost down. So it's helpful, but it's
just one element, as Mike said.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Maybe if I could ask a couple on the downstream side. First, there's been a lot of noise earlier this year
about refinery maintenance activity looking to be well above average in the U.S., particularly in the
first half of the year, especially amongst independent refiners. Your first quarter guidance seems to
suggest turnaround activity in 1Q that's reasonably light or at least not terribly heavy. Any thoughts on
whether 2020 -- year 2023 outlook as a whole for Chevron looks normal or heavy in terms of refining and
maintenance and then maybe more broadly, how you see general tightness in global refining markets this
year over the course of 2023.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I would say it's a pretty typical year for turnaround activity. We've got the FCC at El Segundo in the
first quarter of this year, which Pierre mentioned in his comments. But there's nothing unusual in our
turnaround plan for this year. What you do see across the U.S. and I think in some of the other markets
are 2 things that are really kind of still echoes of COVID. One is you're just seeing capacity go out of the
system. And two, you see maintenance that was deferred during COVID is -- had to be rescheduled and
replanned. And so there's probably still a bit of a bow wave of pushing through the system in some places
of activity that needs to get done for safety and reliability and regulatory reasons. And so that could be
driving some of the speculation. I can't really comment on other companies' plans. I'll let you talk to them
about that.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
And then maybe on the other side of your downstream business on the chemical side, it's clearly been
weeks for the last little while. Looking forward from here, is the combination of lower natural gas prices
and the reopening of China having any impact on how you see margins moving throughout 2023? Or do
you anticipate that oversupply keep things weaker throughout the year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
These tend to be long period cycles for the most part, Ryan. And so at the margin, I think that's economic
growth and development in China is a positive. But you don't slide into the lower part of the cycle quickly
or easily, and you generally don't come out of it quickly or easily. So these things track over a longer
period of time. And so I do think we're -- it feels like we're kind of bumping along near the bottom here,
but I don't know that there's a steep climb out as opposed to a gradual climb over time.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to first follow up on the affiliate distribution guidance because it is taking a step higher year-
over-year, and it sounds like that was due to TCO having excess cash. Is that kind of $5 billion to $6
billion, something you can maintain assuming oil price stays stable until the project actually starts up until
TCO, FGP starts up or would you expect that to fall off after this year?
And then my second question is on a different topic, Venezuela. I believe you have now boots on the
ground there again. Can you just discuss what you're seeing in terms of the health of the infrastructure
there, the ability to ramp production and the desire from Chevron's standpoint to participate in that?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Copyright © 2023 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
On affiliate dividends, there are 2 main factors, why the guidance this year is higher than last year. You hit
one of them on TCO, not held excess cash last year.
The second big one is Angola LNG. You recall, a lot of their cash distributions were actually return to
capital. It's an accounting concept tied to whether you have book equity or positive book equity or not
now, they're in that space. So we expect most, if not all, of the cash coming from Angola LNG in '23 to be
characterized as dividends. It was cash either way. It's just one shows up in cash from ops, the other one
shows up in a different part of the cash flow statement, but that's the second driver.
And in terms of the direction, I mean, this guidance is kind of notionally at the current -- futures curve
around $80. So it depends on commodity prices and margins. There are some downstream affiliates in
there, and there are some chemicals, obviously, in there. But we talked about TCO. I mean, TCO's heading
up, right? As CapEx comes down and production comes up, we expect more dividends out of TCO going
forward. And then again, we have the loan that we also expect TCO to pay back during the next several
years.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jason, on Venezuela, we always did have boots on the ground. We just were very limited in where
those boots could go and what they could do. The shift in the sanctions policy has opened up a little more
room. It's allowed us to work with PDVSA to put some of our people into different roles in these mixed
companies there. So we do have a little more ability to have influence and involvement in some of the
decision making.
Your question about the state of the infrastructure, there's been a lack of investments there for a number
of years in the infrastructure reflects that, and it will take time for things to turn around. We have seen
some positive production response already in the entities that we're involved in. They're producing about
90,000 barrels a day now, which is up about 40,000 barrels a day since we saw the change in these
license terms. So that's been a good short-term effect. I'm not going to say you can extrapolate that, but
it's where we are today. We are continuing to work on the ground to expand production, but it's too early
to guide to anything. We're also lifting oil and bringing it to the U.S. We've got a couple of cargoes coming
into our Pascagoula refinery. We're going to be delivering cargoes to other customers on the Gulf Coast.
And then the revenues go into a series of structured channels to pay expenses and other obligations.
On the accounting standpoint, we're using cost affiliate accounting. So we'll record earnings only if we
receive cash. And at this point, I would say the cash flows are expected to be modest. So this is a step-
wise change in the environment there. We're going to go into it thoughtfully. It's a 6-month license, and
it's a dynamic environment. So we'll continue to advise you as we learn more and as things evolve.

We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
I'll ask about the Rockies. The Rockies is interesting. It's a place where you could maybe add a little bit
of activity to face your aggregate Lower 48 activity levels, but without some of the inflationary pressures
and just infrastructure tightness in the Permian and inventory depth there is good. Is the Rockies a place
where there may be a little bit of extra focus. And I ask that in the context of sort of the broader theme
around your overall resource depth and production and all these topics that are sort of flowing into the
broader conversation today.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, absolutely, Sam. We got over 320,000 net acres there. Last year, we started out with one rig and one
frac crew. We ended the year with 3 rigs and 2 frac crews working and the plan for this year is activity in
that level. So it's been a positive movement in terms of activity and production expectations there.

There's been some permitting questions about this in the past. There's been large areas done under
development plans, and we've got permits well out into the future and continue to work that closely with

Okay. And yes, just a follow-up. I mean, because obviously, between -- I think you can surmise the
reserve numbers getting some attention to the overall pace of activity and production trends over the long
term are getting attention. But we'll get to this at the Analyst Day, I'm sure. But is there a way right now
where you can kind of add it all up and size the Gulf of Mexico, other shale and tight, Eastern Med gas and
just kind of frame that aggregate resource number against maybe what you see in the portfolio today as
tail resource and just speak to a final answer around your organic portfolio and how it extends.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I might have Roderick work with you. So we're clear on the question when we get to the Investor Day
on how to compare and size things relative to the portfolio. But we said today in our press release that
we're very confident we're going to exceed our 3% compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years.
You can't do that unless you get depth in the portfolio, which we have. And you got quality projects they're
moving along on a good pace. And so I'll assure you that, that is the case. We will talk about this more at
Investor Day, and you'll have a chance to kind of go deeper into it with our folks.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Roderick, congratulations, all the best. Mike, I was a bit surprised by the major buyback announcement.
Obviously, the $75 billion is very splashy. But within that, it seems that your guidance has remained
that you'll be in the $5 billion to $15 billion a year range based on the Q1 guidance. Is there -- are
you expecting to step that up? Or is this a 5-year authorization? And were you conscious that it would
probably cause a lot of political backlash.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So Pierre answered the question earlier, it's not a 5-year authorization. It's an open-ended
authorization. It is -- it's our intent to maintain it across the cycle. I'll just say that again. It's actually
aligned with our upside and our downside cases from the '22 Investor Day and consistent with our track
record of being in the market steadily buying $2 below the market over nearly the past 2 decades. And
we could increase our guidance range, Paul. We need to be confident we could maintain that higher rate
for multiple years across the cycle. And I think that you should read it as a signal of confidence and we'll
continue to talk more.
We raised our buyback rate 3x last year. So we're not averse to doing that. And I would just say stay
tuned. In terms of the reaction to it, I think it's perhaps been a touch overblown given that it's an open-
ended program, and we could have size the smaller one and just been prepared to do another one sooner.
Pierre said we're closing one out. We just looked at something that would last over a number of years,
and we were trying to be splashy when we're trying to create any reaction out there. We're just trying to
indicate the confidence we have in our cash generation.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 27, 2023
Understood. And offset to that, Mike, you're spending more on exploration. Could you just talk about the
highlights that you see coming up in 2023. Obviously, we're aware of East Med, but there's other stuff out
there and the spending has stepped up quite a lot, hasn't it?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I don't know if I describe the spending as being up quite a lot. We've got a nice portfolio that we like.
And I'll just touch on -- you mentioned Eastern Med. We still have a lot of blocks in the deepwater Gulf of
Mexico. We've got block in Suriname that we're still working on and that are on trend with some of the
things in that region. We've picked up acreage in Namibia that's on trend with explorations in that part of
the world as well. And so we got stuff in Brazil, we had stuff in Mexico that we acquired a few years prior
to that. So we've got a nice portfolio of opportunities that we continue to work on, and we don't go out
and drill the wells until we're ready to drill them. But it's spread across a number of basins where there's
good working oil and gas systems. And the Norgas discovery is a recent example of what happens when
you focus in those areas, and I'm optimistic that we're going to see more of that in the future.
Operator
Our last question comes from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
So the first one is on the share count. Just going back to early 2022, there was a period where you're
stepping up the buyback program, but the dilution from the employee options was offsetting that a little.
So I'm just trying to understand, I know you took a charge today in the corporate line. Do you expect
2023 dilution to be a similar level to 2022? Or should it be lower? Just any sense on that would be helpful.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We expect fewer employee and retiree exercises of stock options. That was extraordinary unusual in the
first quarter. And it's a zero-sum game. In other words, if employees and retirees do it early, there's fewer
to do going forward. But that will be up to them and the stock price performance. And the share buybacks,
I mean, you just divide it depends on what our stock price is. We give guidance quarterly, and I think
you can do the math. It is confusing the difference between average annual share count and where we
end, right? So we are clearly taking our share count down. But when you look at average annuals, that's
exactly what it implies. It's an annual each day, but the trend is going down. Our buybacks exceed the
issuances and we expect that to continue.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
That's very clear. And then second question is just thinking about asset sales. I was looking at your
guidance, 2023 plans are fairly muted. And I appreciate that you're basically close to 0 debt, so you
don't actually need to do anything but in a high commodity price environment, maybe countercyclically,
you might want to accelerate something. So is this a function of just the limited cleanup needed in the
portfolio or a view on bid-ask spread or anything else? Just to get your view on the asset sale market at
the moment.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So Biraj, we are a little lower than what our typical level of guidance has been, our level of activity.
Over the last decade, we've generated about $35 billion in asset sales. So that's, say, [ $3.5 million ].
There was some portfolio cleanup underway there that was needed to be done, and we get good value
as we sold those. You're always looking at your tail. There's always -- when you sell things off, there's a
new part of your portfolio and say, okay, this sits at the margin. And so you're always challenging that.
If we were to find interested buyers and some of the things that might fit better for others than they do

for us, we could transact on that. This is -- the guidance that we've got right now and the things that are
underway and in process is what we've put out there, and we'll update you if there's any changes to that.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And to only add, Biraj, we don't do asset sales to raise cash or to manage the balance sheet. We do it
based on what Mike just said, high grading of the portfolio where we can get the best returns for capital
projects that can compete for capital, some of the impairments that we took in the fourth quarter are a
result and outcome of projects that are good projects. They're just not good enough to clear the bar. So
it does ebb and flow a little bit as Mike has said, but I just want to be clear, we do it as part of our capital
discipline and having -- driving higher returns and lower carbon. It's an outcome of that. It ebbs and
flows. It's a little low this year. We set it to go back higher in future years.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference facilitator for today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Sarah. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber,
are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's
website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I will now turn it over to
Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We continue to see a challenging
and dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Current events highlight the importance
of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental protection. In line with these 3
imperatives, Chevron remains focused on our objective to safely deliver higher returns and lower carbon.
During the third quarter, we continued to make progress by delivering return on capital employed in the
mid-20s, returning more than $5 billion to shareholders for the second quarter in a row and investing to
grow both our traditional and new energy businesses. Earlier this week, we released our methane report
with specific disclosures about our aim to be a leader in methane emissions management. Our goal is
simple: keep methane in the pipe. I encourage you to read our report available on chevron.com.
Our strategy remains clear and consistent. Our results keep getting better. While future market conditions
are uncertain, we're well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in any environment.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. Third quarter financial results were strong. Included in the quarter were $177 million of
pension settlement costs and positive foreign currency exchange effects of $624 million. The appendix of
this presentation contains a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. We repurchased shares at the high end
of our guidance range and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio under 5%.
Cash CapEx was $3 billion, up over 50% from last year. For the sixth consecutive quarter, Chevron's free
cash flow exceeded $5 billion. We're on track to beat 2021's free cash flow record. Adjusted third quarter
earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year. Adjusted upstream earnings increased mainly on
higher realizations partially offset by inventory timing impacts. In Other, tax benefits are more than offset
by higher operating expenses and other costs. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on
higher refining margins and favorable inventory timing impacts. The planned turnaround at our Richmond
refinery was a driver of higher OpEx and lower volumes for the period. In Other, lower chemicals earnings
were partly offset by higher trading gains.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were down modestly. Adjusted Upstream earnings
increased primarily on higher liftings and tax benefits, partially offset by higher charges for abandonment
accruals and exploration leases. Adjusted Downstream earnings decreased primarily on lower refining
margins and lower volumes and higher OpEx due to the Richmond planned turnaround. Partially offsetting
is a favorable swing in timing effects.
Third quarter oil equivalent production was flat compared to a year ago. Growth in the Permian, along with
the absence of turnarounds and Hurricane Ida impacts were offset by the expiration of our contracts in
Thailand and Indonesia and the sale of our Eagle Ford asset.
Now looking ahead, in the fourth quarter, we expect modest turnaround. After producing a record number
of LNG cargoes in third quarter, we expect fewer spot cargoes out of Australia due to maintenance and
summer temperatures. In the third quarter, we received a dividend from Angola LNG. In the fourth
quarter, we expect dividends from TCO and Angola LNG, and we expect to end 2022 at the top end of
our full year guidance for affiliate dividends. As a reminder, Chevron pays a 15% withholding tax on TCO
dividends that lowers earnings and cash flow.
In the fourth quarter, we will pay over $700 million associated with the early termination of a long-term
LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. This payment was accrued previously through working capital. Also, we
expect to buy back shares at the top end of our guidance range.
In closing, the third quarter showed again how Chevron's higher returns, lower carbon objective creates
value for all of our stakeholders. Back to you, Roderick.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Perfect. Sorry about that. You think I'd have that right by now. Our first question is on U.S.
production growth. So either Mike or Pierre, the Permian was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, averaged
a little under $700,000 a day so far this year. Given industry dynamics and supply chain challenges, can
you provide an update on how operations are going? And I guess what we noticed is that with only 1
quarter left in the -- left for the year, it looks like you'll be closer to the lower end of the $700,000 to
$750,000 guidance range. And so we're just wondering if that's by design or if there's external factors
driving that because we also noticed this morning, one of your integrated peers in the Permian lowered
their '22 growth expectations.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jeanine, my numbers say year-to-date, Permian production, a little over 700,000 barrels a day,
up about 15% from first 3 quarters of last year, which was just a touch over 600. So we're seeing good
growth. And for the quarter itself, production was up about 10% at 708,000 barrels a day versus 646 in
the same quarter last year. I think the thing that some people may miss is during the pandemic, drilled
but uncompleted well inventories really grew.
And rightfully so, we didn't need to frac wells and bring them online when there was declining demand for
the production. So -- and we kept some drilling going. So that inventory grew as we went back to work,
the first thing we did was send completion crews out and start to bring the DUCs online. And you saw that
through the back half of last year and certainly the first part of this year, which may have misled a little bit
in terms of the rate of growth because this was this kind of surge capacity.
We're back to Factor VIII drilling now. Our DUC inventory is kind of in line with what our plan would
suggest it would be. And so we're seeing production level out at a growth rate that is more the kind of
underlying rate that you should see. So we likely will be towards the lower end of the range. We get some
nonratable bookings from our non-operated joint ventures. We give you a range because we expect to be
in the range, but we don't always hit the high end of the range. So in this case, we'll be towards the lower
end. But we're not changing guidance for this year or our forward guidance.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And Jeanine, I'll just add, that low end of the range, it represents 15% year-on-year growth. So that's
very strong growth.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Agreed. Maybe, Pierre, just sticking with you here. In terms of your comments earlier this morning,
I think I caught it in an article that '23 CapEx would be at the top end of the $15 million to $17 million
medium-term guidance range. There's a lot of moving pieces, and I don't know if you're going to talk
about this because you'll have to -- you'll release it in a month or so.
But the most obvious moving pieces that we see next year are that TCO spend starting to roll off, and
some of that will be absorbed by the Permian, which we know is going to garner some more capital next
year. So our question is, is capital trending to the higher end of that range? Is that more a reflection of

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
Chevron responding to the macro environment? Or was that always part of the plan? And maybe just
some inflation is pushing the capital a little higher?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
It was always part of the plan for us to increase investment coming out of COVID, as Mike just spoke
about. We're in the final stages of approving our business plan and our capital budget. And as you
said, we'll announce that in December. You should expect it to be near the top end of the range, again,
consistent with what our plans have been. We're going to increase in the Permian and in other locations.
We do have some cost inflation that is also -- will contribute to that. We'll share all those details when
we announce in December. And that's about a 20% increase in next year relative to where we think we'll
end up this year. So year-to-date, we're a little bit below our capital budget on an organic basis. And so
that will result in about a 20% increase, which is very, again, in line with our guidance and consistent with
increasing investment and growing energy supplies.
Operator
And our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
The first question was around Kazakhstan, and Mike, would just love your perspective on how you're
viewing the assets out there, both the development of Tengiz? And then as you think through vacating
barrels via the CPC pipeline?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So I'll start with the project. We're on track to complete bulk construction by the end of this year. No
change to our cost or schedule guidance, we're 97% complete on construction right now. There's still a lot
of work to be done, but the risk and uncertainty are certainly narrowing and the remaining risks tend to be
smaller in scale and potential impact.
So we're moving into commissioning systems testing and start-up activities. We built a new integrated
operations control center that I visited, which is fully operational with systems online. Our drilling program
is complete. The final metering station is online. So very good progress on the construction side, and we'll
continue to update you as we progress toward WPMP, the pressure management startup indicated right
now for second half of '23 and then the future growth project in '24.
On the CPC and the pipeline, there are no constraints on our ability to move barrels on that line. We've
flowed everything out that we've been producing. And you've probably seen the media reports that a
couple of the single-point moorings are offline right now for some repairs. So the buoyancy system, those
repairs are underway and expected to be completed shortly. So at this point, everything flowing and it
looks like we'll continue to do so.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
And Mike, you spent many years as a downstreamer as well and have great perspective on the global
refining system. I don't think I ever thought that the cracks would be up here. So just love your
perspective of where we are in terms of the refining market, how do we work our way through the
bottlenecks that seem to be existing in the system and what that means for your Downstream business?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. It's been an interesting couple of years in the refining sector, Neil. With COVID, we actually saw
through that period of time, some refineries shut down around the world that maybe at a rate greater

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
than we would have expected before as the economics really collapsed, as demand collapsed. There were
-- been some refineries in the U.S. that have been taken offline after storm damage or operating incidents
that are not coming back.
We see others being converted to renewable diesel. And so you had a constraint or a reduction in refining
capacity that occurred over the last couple of years in a way we really haven't seen previously. And the
other thing that happened is some of the new builds that are in various stages of development, primarily
in the Middle East or Asia, slowed down during COVID. And a lot of the industry slowed activity until we
had a better view on how we were going to come through that period of time.
I think those will come back into developments and eventually online which will ease some of these global
constraints. But the system is tight right now. And what you see is when you have some maintenance that
runs along, some unplanned events, as we've seen on the West Coast, or when you see things like the
strike that we've seen in France here recently, markets tighten up really quickly. And that sends a price
signal to try to bring supplies in from further away.
And so the entire refining complex right now is a little more tightly balanced than it historically has been.
And I think in the short term, if you want to call that the next year, plus or minus, probably stays that
way, maybe a little bit longer to some degree. And then I think as you see some of this new capacity come
online, we get back into a situation where it's not quite as finely balanced as it is today. But to no doubt,
we're in a market that we really haven't seen probably in my career in terms of the overall tightness on
supply and demand.
Operator
And our next question will come from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Just thinking about your buyback range, $5 billion to $15 billion. 3Q is a strong quarter from a
fundamental perspective, but maybe feels more repeatable to me than as an upside case than 2Q did.
In 3Q, you still generated free cash flow well in excess of both your dividend and the buyback at the top
end of the range. So my question is do you think you could go further than the $15 billion at the top end,
given you still have a good amount of deleveraging happening at this point in the cycle, it doesn't seem
quite as extraordinary as 2Q did.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. John, we've actually increased our rate of buybacks 3 times this year. We announced the first one at
the end of last year. So we've steadily moved the range up and the rate of repurchases up. And so we're
at an all-time high in terms of the rate of share repurchases. And you're right. We've got strong cash flow
right now, which allows us to support all of our financial priorities and maintain the strong balance sheet.
I think the thing that I just would reemphasize is we want to maintain the buyback program throughout
the cycle. And we're not procyclical. We're not countercyclical. We want to operate across the cycle so that
our shareholders see consistency out of us and know that they can count on that. And so we're positioned
in a way where we're confident we can maintain that. And we regularly reassess it as our view on our
business and commodity markets continues to evolve. And so we'll continue to do that and apprise you of
anything further. Pierre, do you want to add anything to that?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'll just point out that we increased our dividend 6% earlier this year. We've been growing our dividend at
a compounded annual growth rate of 6% for 15 years. And that is our first financial priority. So there's a
lot of tension on the buyback, but it's clearly our fourth priority after sustaining and growing the dividend,
investing to grow both traditional and new energy businesses, maintaining a strong balance sheet. And as
Mike said, we intend to do it across the cycle for multiple years.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Great. And then just looking at your bridge for international upstream, and I think Pierre may have
mentioned in his remarks as well. You have this tailwind about $300 million from tax. Is that an impact
from country mix? Or are there other moving pieces we should think about there? And should we think
about this as sustainable?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
In terms of international upstream, the benefit in the third quarter was primarily around a record LNG
cargoes out of Australia, primarily Gorgon and Wheatstone are very happy to see that. It was a time when
the world needed the energy. And again, a lot of that is under long-term contracts, but that included
cargoes in the spot market, which we know we're at high prices.
So we signaled that we expect of fewer LNG cargoes in the fourth quarter because during the summer
temperatures in the southern hemisphere is just how -- you just produce less. And then we do have a pit
stop that is planned for 1 of our facilities. In terms of tax items, those are items that can be onetime in
nature. And so I would not look for those to be necessarily repeating.
Operator
Our next question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Maybe just to ask a question that kind of ties a little bit into the question on the Permian. Maybe as you
said, lower end in the non-op portion and the CapEx discussion. But just a broad question on inflation
and not just inflation in the price sense, but some of the productivity challenges that come when you
start getting busier. I mean you've got as good a global footprint as anybody. I'm just curious how you'd
characterize that as you look across? And is there -- is it becoming more challenging to mitigate some of
those issues?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Roger, the -- I'd like to tell people we plan our work and work our plan. And so we've indicated for --
frankly, if you go back to pre COVID, our trajectory is that we pretty much have stayed right on even with
the interruption of COVID. And so in terms of contracting for rigs, completion crews, pipe, sand, you name
it, we tend to have a longer-term visibility into that. We commit to our service providers earlier, and that
can result in both quality and availability of people, equipment, et cetera.
So we don't see any meaningful constraints on our ability to execute our program. Certainly, we are seeing
some cost inflation. And the Permian is probably the strongest that we see around the world, kind of into
the low double digits year-on-year. In other parts of our portfolio, the cost pressures are probably a little
bit less and the constraints aren't quite as pressing.
So I think you'll see a little bit of that in our capital guidance as it comes out as we wrap up our planning
and we look to next year. And I do think that it is probably a very real, I don't want to call it a governor,
but a constraint on industry, the pace of industry activity and ramp up as we get into the next year. You'll
hear other people talking about it from their point of view, and I'll let them comment, but yes, it's very
real.
And we've seen this movie before. In the Permian, we've seen it up in the oil sands a decade earlier. And
in a cyclical business, this is a part of it.

Yes, for sure. Follow-up question. Renewable natural gas RNG, we saw big acquisition announced here a
few weeks ago on that front. You've been one of the leaders. And I was just curious, as you look at what's
been going on in terms of some of the legislation that's come out federally as well as just the extent of
the impact of the LCFS in California. Any updates we should think about in the RNG business. One of the
things mentioned in that acquisition was the position that company already had in terms of -- I guess
you'd call it leaseholds, right, on landfills and stuff and just characterize kind of where you are relative to
where you want to be and to where maybe this competitor is setting up.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. We feel very good about where we are. We're a leader in RNG, leveraging strengths across the
entire value chain, from feedstock to customer. We've been a partner of choice for a lot of the dairy
farmers. We've got a strong brand to pull through. We've got a really strong market position in California
where the LCFS provides the strongest incentives for this. So we like the position that we've built up.
We've got 75 CNG sites online are in progress right now through the retail side.
So our efforts, we were an early mover and we've preferentially focused on dairy as opposed to landfill
gas. So there certainly are others that are active in this area. I don't want to comment on how somebody
else looks at things. I would just say, our business is up and running, and we're supplying customers
today, not kind of planning out into the future and kind of banking on that. I mean we intend to grow it
further, but it's a real business for us today and it's performing well.

Our next question will come from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So I wanted to stick with New Energies first. And a few weeks ago, there was an announcement that you
joined a consortium to look at a hydrogen and ammonia project in the Gulf Coast. So I was wondering if
you could talk in a little bit more detail around that. And then more broadly, with the Inflation Reduction
Act passage, how you're thinking about the opportunity set in your New Energies platform over the next
few years?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So we're excited about the announcements to work with a number of really good partners to try
to develop hydrogen opportunities there on the Gulf Coast. One of the things I think you're going to see
in these New Energies businesses as they evolve is we're going to have to build entire new value chains.
And that means we're going to partner with different people who have expertise in different parts of these
value chains and can bring technology, can bring customers, can bring experience to a venture that no one
company necessarily would have all of that, but collectively, we can work with people that can build these
new value chains.
And so it's early days on many of these things, we're studying all the different opportunities in terms of
blue hydrogen, green hydrogen, there's a lot of different colors that are possible as you get down into the
details of it. And it will require significant investments. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves here.
This is to really develop well-informed perspectives on the investment opportunities, the business models
and ultimately, how we would build the business up there.
But it's exciting. They're high-quality partners that we are working with. And I think you'll see more of
these efforts announced here. We've got a lot of it that we're working on around the world, not just here
in the U.S.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
Great. Look forward to seeing the additional details there over time. My second question is actually on
M&A and just consolidation. And if you think back over the last few years, you've had a great track record,
the Noble deal in 2020 REGI more recently. Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about how you're
viewing the landscape for further acquisitions, upstream, downstream and even New Energies going
forward.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure, Devin. So we're always looking. We've got an evergreen process where we scan all the different
sectors that are of interest to us. And so we watch companies, we watch sectors, we watch opportunities.
Although we've had a pretty high bar, which is why we've only done a few deals. And as you say, we feel
like the deals we've done are likely to turn out well.
We've got a strong portfolio. We've got a really strong base case. And so we don't need to do a deal unless
it really improves on what we expect to deliver otherwise. So I would just say we're going to continue to
be very disciplined. We don't have an open checkbook even when times are good like this, especially when
times are good like this. We walked away from a deal a few years ago rather than chase value out of it.
We've sold assets out of our portfolio at well times. And as you say, the last couple of deals were done
at a pretty good time. So over time, I think in the oil and gas business, there's likely to be some more
consolidation. You need fewer and stronger companies that normally happens at the bottom of the cycle
rather than at the top of the cycle. In New Energies, there's a lot of activity, to Devin's question, and I
think there's a very active market out there where you could see some things come together because
nobody has all the pieces.
And I think as you look at building these businesses, we're going to find combinations probably are
necessary to actually begin to put those pieces together. But we're going to be disciplined as we have
been all along. And if we do anything, we'll come out to explain to you how it's going to create value for
shareholders.
Operator
Our next question will come from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Mike or Pierre, maybe I've got one for each of you guys, and I'll go to Pierre first. So Pierre, I think you've
been -- both of you guys have been very clear about managing the buyback through the cycle. And I
think we all probably agree that your breakeven is not one of the best in the industry. But you still end up
building a ton of cash and your share price is at, I guess, pretty close to an all-time high.
So I'm just curious, the last thing you had this situation, you had multiple parallel projects going on to
manage almost close to a net debt 0 balance sheet. What's to prevent you from building cash on the
balance sheet and being opportunistic, whether it be through M&A or whether it be a cyclical opportunity
to buy back your shares at a low level? I'm just curious how you think about that.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We've had a philosophy that goes back a long time and a track record. Again, I think that speaks for itself,
35 years of dividend increases, again, compounding at 6% for the last 15 years. Our investments in our
traditional new energy growing both our guidance on upstream production growth is 3% compounded.
We're now the second largest biorenewable diesel producer in the country with our REGI acquisition.
And when we generate cash in excess of that, it first goes to the balance sheet. So we've been very clear
that our stated net debt ratio is between 20% to 25%. That's still a very strong balance sheet. If you
recall, as we entered COVID, we were the only company that showed a stress test at $30 Brent and our
net debt ratio was going to go into the low 30s if in fact, we would have had 2 years at 30. But that would

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
have been where many of our peers started into COVID. So we've always maintained a strong balance
sheet, and we think that's appropriate over the cycle to be in that range.
But we're well below that. Our net debt is under 5%. So that's just a function of cash coming in and our
just commitment to not be procyclical, we could have a larger buyback program today. Absolutely, if we
wanted to just peg our net debt ratio at a higher level. But I think our shareholders would appropriately
question that strategy as not being across the cycle.
So we're setting the buyback at a level that allows us to maintain it across the cycle when prices do
correct. We'll continue to buy back shares near the top end of the range that we've been talking about.
In terms of acting countercyclically, in terms of M&A or any kind of major capital project, we have the
capacity to do that at all kinds of balance sheets.
We've shown that on M&A, we use equity because we think it makes a lot of sense. There's oil price risk
in any kind of transaction so we don't need to do it all with cash. It will come with debt very likely. So
we want to have some capacity but using equity in oil deals makes a lot of sense. And again, we have a
great portfolio of projects, but we've shown a 10-year profile in addition to our 5-year guidance where the
growth continues. We have a lot of great projects to choose from.
The goal here is to sustain and grow the enterprise with the lowest capital possible. We're more capital
and cost efficient than we've ever been. We've talked about that. And we're not really paid for growth
by the market. So we're growing at very appropriate rates, strong rates for the next 5 years. And again,
we've shown beyond that, but we certainly have the balance sheet and the capability to do more if we
think, again, as Mike said, it's in the interest of our shareholders.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Mike, I hate to put you in the spot, but you have the privilege or the challenge, I guess, of meeting with
administration recently. I asked this question to your larger peer earlier today. And I'm just curious if you
would care to share your thoughts on some of the potential legislative risks that might face the industry.
And I guess, at a big picture level, I'm curious whether if you feel that the kind of ESG pendulum from an
investor standpoint is beginning to swing back in your favor? Just that any thoughts you may care to share
on that.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure, Doug. So look, when we meet with policymakers, including those in the administration, what I talk
about is the importance in energy of balancing economic prosperity, energy security and environmental
protection. And all 3 of those things matter. Economic prosperity is affordable energy underpins the ability
of the economics or economies to thrive.
Reliable energy is tied to national security, and we're seeing that play out in different parts of the
world today. And then, of course, there are the concerns about the environmental impacts of energy
production and energy use, and we have to take those very seriously as well. And so my message to the
policymakers is to be sure that we consider the appropriate balance of all 3 of those in policy because if
you over-index on just one, you can create unintended consequences and vulnerabilities that may not
manifest themselves for a little while, but they're there.
And eventually, they do materialize. And so I'm a believer that we share a lot of common ground with
governments around the world as we talk about these issues. We share common ground with our investors
who are concerned about these things as well. And so look, we've been doing ESG for a long time. I
keep a book on my desk called the Standard Oil Spirit that was written in 1923. And it talks about our
commitment to people, it talks about our commitment to protecting the environment. And this has been
in the ethos of the company forever, and it's evolved as society has evolved. And so we're committed to
being a responsible company and being a part of the solution here in the U.S. and around the world.

Our next question will come from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Maybe one follow-up question on biofuels, on the liquid side of the biofuels market. Could you maybe
provide an update how you're seeing the liquid biofuels market maybe relative to your expectations,
particularly with a little time with the REG acquisition under your belt? You're expanding pretreatment in
Germany, Europe pitching things towards sustainable aviation fuel.
So how is the market playing out relative to your expectations? How do you see the past issue playing out
between U.S. and Europe? And then maybe any update on the progress of the Geismar renewable diesel
facility that you acquired from REG?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So I'll start with the REG acquisition. The assets are good, the people are little better. Any
surprises so far have been to the upside. We've already identified quick wins, commercial opportunities.
We've lowered insurance and financing costs. Integration efforts are all on track and delivering on our
expectations. We're seeing placement of biodiesel in the Chevron's West Coast refining or in the marketing
network, and that continues to ramp up.
We're optimizing freight and feedstocks across the system. So all of that builds on the strength that both
companies had in the renewable fuels value chain. And we just see it as really a nice combination here.
The Geismar expansion is underway, and we're halfway already to our renewable fuels target as that's
completed. We indicated we're going to grow to 100,000 barrels a day. We're well on our way to do that.
And of course, we're investing in other relationships. We've got a joint venture with Bunge, where we're
now participating in the soybean crush spread and bringing feedstocks into the system. We're working on
converting hydro processing capacity at some of our refineries to be able to run bio feedstocks. So this is
a part of our business that will grow the economics on it, like anything in the downstream or a function of
feedstock costs, supply demand in markets.
But they've been good so far, and we expect across the cycle and out into time that they're going to
continue to be an important part of our portfolio. We are seeing more people go into renewable diesel. It's
a market that, like any other commodity market at times may get long and margins may reflect that. But
we're familiar with those dynamics from our traditional business.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Thanks, Mike. Maybe one more. Just maybe a little speculative, but any thoughts on what you think the
impact of a Russian product import ban to Europe on how that could play out in terms of product flows?
Are those barrels likely to find a home in Latin America or Africa? Or do you think that we may actually see
a decent amount of that Russian product disappear from the market?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Any of these export bans have to be looked at within the context of the broader market. And as you
say, just as we've seen on crude, where the U.S. has managed the import of Russian crude Europe hasn't
yet that's coming. And -- but it's a global market. And you've got other buyers that need -- they need the
products and they're not participating in the sanctions necessarily.
And so going to the earlier question from Neil about the products side of the business, markets are tight
right now. Diesel, in particular, as we've seen here recently and likely to stay that way through the winter,
I think. Further, we get into the first quarter when the products ban comes into effect in Europe. And I
think that's going to be set against a backdrop of pretty tight product markets, and you are going to find
countries around the world need that fuel.

And you get into logistics then, you've got longer shipping legs, which do you have enough ships to move
it and how do you -- how does the system reoptimize? It's a less efficient optimization for sure than
moving it to the natural closer markets. But I do think that you'll see those products continue to flow
although just go to more distant markets with increased costs and logistics and continue to keep some of
this pressure on the overall balances out there.
Operator
Our next question will come from Lucas Herrmann with Exane.
Lucas Oliver Herrmann
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
Two, if I might. The first for you, Pierre. Just remind me, in terms of the associate contribution towards
the top end of the range, I think the indication was $3 billion at the top end of the range, but perhaps
you could give us an indication of the level of dividend that's been paid out to associate to date. And I
guess I'm a little surprised that in the current environment, one might expect that the associate dividend
would be beyond the $3 billion? And then, Mike, just if you could just give us a whirlwind tour or it's not
whirlwind, but just talk around the Gulf the developments that are taking place there within your own
portfolio and how those are proceeding and your current thoughts on timing. That'd be great.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. I'll let Pierre start, and then when I come back, I'll just ask you to clarify, Gulf of Mexico or...
Lucas Oliver Herrmann
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
Sorry, Gulf of Mexico. Yes, no, Gulf of Mexico.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Very good.
Lucas Oliver Herrmann
BNP Paribas Exane, Research Division
You're welcome to talk about both, Mike.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Lucas, you're right that affiliate dividends at last quarter, we guided to be above the top end of the range,
and now we're guiding at the top end of the range, which we increased during the course of the year. And
that reflects really 2 items. Angola LNG has in the affiliate income line, been generating earnings all year,
but during the first half of the year, the cash return was a return to capital and the dividend. And so it's
showing up in a different part of the cash flow statement.
And then the second item is, given the uncertainty at CPC, TCO is holding more cash. We'll get more
cash out of TCO. But I think TCO appropriately is just being cautious. As Mike said, all of our barrels are
flowing. In October, we expect them all to flow. In November, we expect the repairs to be completed
shortly. That said, they're just being cautious and holding a little higher cash balances. So we'll be at the
top end of the range through 3Q, I think we're at about $2 billion of affiliate dividends. You can confirm
that with Roderick.
But the reason why you're seeing that the cash flow line of affiliate income less dividends being a little
bit larger than maybe you'd expect, it's primarily those 2 drivers in terms of the quirks of Angola LNG
accounting and TCO holding cash balances, which will be a temporary thing, and we expect that, that we'll
see higher cash in the future from them.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Gulf of Mexico, Lucas, as you know, we're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf. We've got
over 270 leases out there and a strong base business, a lot of installed infrastructure that enables capital-
efficient brownfield development. And importantly, it's one of the most carbon-efficient assets in our
portfolio with a carbon intensity of about 6 kilograms of CO2 per barrel of oil equivalent. Lease Sale 257
is the one that was in question. Here a few months ago, as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, that's
been clarified and that lease sale is proceeding.
We picked up 34 leases in that sale. And we look forward to continued leasing by the federal government
as indicated and kind of encouraged by the Inflation Reduction Act, and we'll participate in those. In terms
of production growth, we will advance a number of projects that are underway right now. Jack St. Malo
has a multiphase pumping project that starts up this year and some additional development drilling.
Bigfoot has ongoing development drilling and water injection that will begin in the first quarter of next
year.
Mad Dog 2 is operated by one of our partners, and I would refer you to them for an update on that
project. We've got at St. Malo, our waterflood first injection plan for next year. Anchor a new greenfield
project. We expect first oil on that in 2024. Whale, another greenfield project operated by one of our
partners. I expect first oil on that towards the end of 2024.
And then we recently took FID in the second quarter of this year on the Ballymore project and expect
first oil on that one in 2025. So I appreciate the question because oftentimes, I hear people say, well,
we can see the Kazakhstan growth. We can see the Permian. What else do you have? We've got a string
of projects there in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico that are kind of sequentially lined out that will steadily
contribute to production growth here in the U.S. from the deepwater.
Operator
And our next question will come from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I've got 2 left, please. First one is just going back to Kazakhstan and CPC. My understanding is there's
been sort of fortuitous timing for Tengiz because one of the other projects in Kazakhstan has been offline,
which has allowed Tengiz to flow despite the capacity obviously being lower.
So I was just trying to understand, hypothetically, if Kazakh production comes back up to full capacity, but
the pipeline capacity is maintained to be reduced or is not at full capacity? Then do all the projects get pro
rata down equally? Or is there any other quirks that we need to be aware of there as it relates to Tengiz?
And then the second question is on your LNG portfolio, performed extremely strong this quarter. Can you
say what proportion of your LNG portfolio is sold under long-term contracts? And what portion is sold on a
spot basis, either for the year or over the medium term?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So at CPC, I mentioned earlier that right now, only 1 of the 3 single point moorings is operational.
The other 2 are down for some maintenance and repair work that's well underway. And so we would
expect that work to be completed and to be able to handle full flows on CPC here before too long. If for
some reason that didn't happen, and we were constrained to the 1 SPM, that has the capacity to load out
about 70% of what CPC can move when it's operating full.
So there would be some constraints on movements. TCO has long been the initial, the largest and in many
ways I think the most important shipper on that line and that's reflected in some of the practices that I
don't want to get into the details, but we would still be able to flow barrels, maybe not all of our barrels,

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
but I think TCO would be well positioned to not be disadvantaged, let me say that, if there were some sort
of proration underway.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'll just add that the nominations for CPC for November have already been put in place and Tengiz TCO
essentially got a full nomination even for November. And again, that's even in a situation if the SPMs are
not repaired. Of course, if they're repaired by then, fine issue, but even if they stay down for November,
TCO has already received a full nomination.
On the LNG question Biraj, it's notionally around 80% contracted, 20% spot. That's a combination of both
of our Australia LNG operations and our West Africa operations. Our West Africa tends to be almost all spot
and Australia is closer to 90-10. So that averages out to about 80-20. And we'll give guidance on our spot
price sensitivity. We'll do that in the fourth quarter call at the end of January. It depends on how many
spot cargoes are produced, both out of, again, our West Africa and Australia operations.
Operator
And our next question will come from Irene Himona with SocGen.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
Congratulations on the very strong results. My first question, your financial framework is clearly to
manage through the cycle. But at the same time, the current uncertainty on the commodity price outlook
is rather extreme, and that is partly because of the risks or fears of a recession. So my question is, as you
look at your Downstream businesses, whether in the U.S. or Asia, have you seen any signs of an economic
slowdown which would cause you some concern as you look ahead to 2023 and which might perhaps drive
a more conservative approach to CapEx growth?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Irene, thanks. Demand remains pretty strong globally across the product. Now there are some
variations in that. Certainly, the U.S. West Coast, which had some refining issues and prices reflected that.
We saw gasoline demand in the third quarter, responsive to those higher prices and a little bit of softness
there.
Diesel demand has been pretty strong around the world, maybe a little less so in China, given some of
the lockdowns that they're seeing. And aviation demand has been steadily coming back as people are
flying again not quite to pre-COVID levels yet, but steadily increasing. And so overall, I wouldn't say that
product demand that we've seen to date is sending a strong signal that a recession is underway or that
the economy is significantly slowing. As I said, there's always some kind of regional or maybe sectoral
unique characteristics. But no, we're not really seeing that yet, Irene.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
My supplementary question, if I can go back to renewable natural gas, please. LCSS prices have more
or less halved over the last year. I wonder if you can help us understand the impact, if any, on your own
R&D. Does it create some pressures to perhaps work more on the technology to try and reduce the costs,
given that the value of the incentive is half what it was last year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So let me set the incentive aside for a second. In every one of our Downstream businesses, we're
always working on reducing costs and improving technology and finding ways to become more efficient.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2022 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 28, 2022
And so that's inherent in our business. The dynamics around LCFS credits, RINs, AB32 credits in California,
the EU trading scheme. All of these things, we have to manage through their own cycles.
And it's a part of our business that is related to but not necessarily correlated to the fundamental supply-
demand dynamics that drive physical flows because you have government allocations of credits and
whether people are building inventories or credits or drawing down inventories of these credits. And so
they don't necessarily correlate with the underlying commodity. And we've got a fair amount of experience
in managing that.
Certainly, the economics on something like RNG rely on the credit structure and the regulatory framework
that incentivized those businesses. And if you see the credits declining in value that it starts to erode a
little bit of the margin in that business. We have to take a long-term view on these things. And I think the
regulators do the same. And as they see credit values reflect a lot of length in credits, that suggests that
the technology is advancing, the supply is advancing and they can set more ambitious targets. And so
these things evolve over time. And I think our people have a pretty good track record of managing in that
environment.
Operator
And our last question comes from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Mike and Pierre, one question for each. First is a simple one. In the past in your presentation, when you're
talking about Downstream, we talk about what's the chemical earning sequentially, whether they are up
or down. You didn't mention in your presentation at this time. Does that means that chemical earnings is
actually relatively flat, which is surprising given how much is the margin drop we've seen in the industry.
So that's the first question.
Second question on Mike, is for the LNG longer-term strategy. most of your peers that have been pretty
aggressive in growing their LNG operation, you have very possible or at least very cash flow rich LNG
operation, but you don't really have much time to grow at least on the table. Can you maybe elaborate
that what is your longer-term -- medium- to longer-term strategy in LNG.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure, Paul. Yes, quickly on chemicals, earnings were a little bit lower quarter-on-quarter. And that's really
a function of margins. We had higher ethane prices and lower polyethylene prices. And so the olefins
margins, which is the largest driver of our performance were squeezed. So it did go down sequentially.
On LNG strategy, we've long favored the Pacific Basin, given the best customers were in Japan, Korea,
Taiwan markets and our resource position in the Pacific. The Atlantic Basin, we've got exposure to it. But
Europe traditionally has been a market where you were competing with Russian pipe gas and just less
attractive. With the changes now that we see in markets, we're increasing exposure to Atlantic Basin LNG.
We've done a couple of deals with Gulf Coast projects that are being developed that will give us offtake
that we can move into global markets.
And then we're advancing projects in the Eastern Mediterranean and the assets that were acquired
with the Noble acquisition, that would potentially allow an expansion of the Leviathan field to provide
LNG supply that can go into global markets. We've looked at other things. So the big process has been
underway in cutter. We certainly were deeply involved in evaluating that opportunity.
Like everything that we look at, LNG has to compete against the other investment opportunities in our
portfolio. We're going to stay very disciplined on capital and we won't invest in everything that we could.
We're going to invest in the best things that we can. And I expect that will include some LNG projects over
time.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference
call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation,
Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our CFO, Pierre Breber; and EVP of Upstream, Jay Johnson, are
on the call with me today. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's
website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thank you, Roderick, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We delivered another strong quarter, another quarter of strong financial results with ROCE over 25%, the
highest since 2008. Special items this quarter include asset sale gains of $200 million and a $600 million
charge to terminate early a long-term LNG regas contract at Sabine Pass. C&E for the quarter was nearly
$4 billion, including inorganic spend to form our JV with Bunge. With the acquisition of REG, our total
investment was $6.8 billion, more than double last year's quarter.
Strong cash flow enabled us to fund this higher level of investment, pay down debt for the fifth
consecutive quarter and returned more than $5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and
buybacks. Adjusted second quarter earnings were up more than $8 billion versus last year. Adjusted
Upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations, partially offset by lower liftings from the end
of concessions in Indonesia and Thailand. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased primarily on higher
refining margins.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted earnings were up nearly $5 billion. Adjusted Upstream earnings
increased primarily on higher realizations, partially offset by tax and other items, including higher
withholding taxes on TCO dividends and cash repatriations. Adjusted Downstream earnings increased
primarily on higher refining margins and a favorable swing in timing effects.
The All Other segment was up due in part to a favorable change in the valuation of stock-based
compensation.
I'll now turn it over to Jay.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production decreased about 7% year-on-year due to
expiration of our contracts in both Indonesia and Thailand, the sale of our Eagle Ford asset and CPC
curtailments impacting TCO during April. This was partially offset by shale and tight growth, primarily in
the Permian.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
In the Permian, we're delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon. Our development
costs are down about 25% since 2019, and we expect to keep them flat this year by offsetting inflation
with productivity improvements. An example of simul frac, where we performed completion activities on 4
wells at a time, reducing cycle time by a quarter.
We continue to design, construct and operate facilities to limit methane emissions. 2 of our Midland
Basin sites recently earned the highest ratings from Project Canary's independent certification program.
Production is at record levels and growing in line with guidance with our royalty position, providing a
distinct financial advantage for our shareholders.
At TCO, the drilling program is complete, and the final metering station is online. We expect to complete
construction by year-end with remaining project activities, primarily focused on systems completion,
commissioning and start-up. Total project cost guidance is unchanged. WPMP startup is expected in the
second half of next year and FGP expected timing remains first half of 2024. TCO's operations continue to
generate strong cash flow, enabling a midyear dividend. With project spend decreasing, we're expecting
higher dividends going forward.
In Australia, we shipped 87 LNG cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone in the first half of this year, up over
10% from last year. Our reliability benchmarks in the first quartile and we intend to stay there with an
ongoing focus on operational excellence. Gorgon Stage 2, the first backfill project, is on track to deliver
first gas in September.
Our Gulf of Mexico projects are progressing well, with Ballymore receiving FID as a tieback to Blind Faith,
an example of leveraging our existing infrastructure to improve returns. The Anchor hull is currently sailing
from Korea and work on its top sides continues in Texas.
Lastly, we recently signed agreements to export 4 million tons a year of LNG from the U.S. Gulf Coast,
with 1.5 million tons a year expected to start in 2026. These agreements leverage our growing U.S.
natural gas production and expand our value chains in Atlantic Basin markets.
Now back to you, Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jay. We closed the REG acquisition last month, and integration is going very well. We're pleased
to welcome REG's talented employees to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. Our teams have already
identified further commercial opportunities, and we quickly acted to lower insurance and financing costs.
In May, we launched our joint venture with Bunge. The JV is operating 2 existing crushers, and evaluation
work is underway to expand crush capacity and add pretreatment facilities.
In carbon capture and storage, we closed on the expanded JV to develop the Bayou Bend CCS hub. The
lease held by the JV is in Texas state waters, near large industrial emitters, and we believe it is the first
U.S. offshore lease dedicated to CCS. Also, we recently filed for a conditional use permit in Kern County,
California, to store CO2 emissions from one of our cogeneration plants.
Now looking ahead. In the third quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production in
a number of locations. In Downstream, planned turnarounds are primarily at our California refineries.
We do not expect significant dividends from TCO for Angola LNG until the fourth quarter. Our full year
guidance for affiliate dividends is unchanged, with upside potential beyond the top of the range depending
on commodity prices. Also, we increased the top end of our share buyback guidance range to $15 billion
per year and expect to be at that rate during the third quarter.
In closing, we're executing our plans, increasing investment to grow both traditional and new energy
supplies and delivering value to our stakeholders. Although commodity markets may be volatile, our
actions are consistent through the cycle and focus on our objectives to deliver higher returns and lower
carbon.
Back to you, Roderick.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So Jay, I wanted to congratulate you on the retirement plans and take advantage of having you here
on the call. My first one is on TCO. And it's great to see the project progress there. And with the WPMP
portion of the project largely complete, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the
remaining milestones for that second phase FGP as you progress toward that first half 2024 startup.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thank you, Devin, for both the retirement wishes and the question. But TCO, we've been just steadily
making progress here, and we had a very strong period in the first half of this year. We had the unrest in
January, of course, and then the team responded well after that, even with some of the Omicron impacts.
As we are finishing construction, we expect to finish construction on everything this year and be largely
into the commissioning phase. And this is largely putting together doing the pressure testing, filling with
fluids, cleaning systems and preparing them for eventual startup.
The WPMP that we expect in the second half of next year will be around enabling us to boost the pressure
from the field up to the facilities. So we don't expect to see a material change in our production at that
point in time, but it enables us then to move into the phase of start-up for FGP where we will start to see
incremental production coming through the plant.
And some of the big milestones we've already accomplished. All 40 production wells are already now
produced and completed and actually producing into the plant that helps us with the transition from the
high pressure to the low-pressure phase. We've got the injection wells already completed so we can begin
the FGP startup. Field facilities are well underway in terms of the new gathering system. We'll have about
all the metering stations have to be converted to high pressure to low pressure. They'll be done kind of
one at a time, so we can maintain production through that period.
So those are the -- you won't see a lot of outward signs other than progress on the commissioning, the
number of subsystems completed and that's really what we're moving into. Rather than percent complete,
we're 93% complete overall now. What's going to be more important are just the rundown curves as we
bring each system to completion.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Great. Very helpful and great progress there. And sticking with TCO in that part of your portfolio. There's
been a lot of headlines around the CPC pipeline in recent weeks and months. I just wondering if you could
give us a status update on where things stand there? And then also to the extent that there were to be
any further disruptions to flows on that pipe, can you talk a little bit about the impacts to operations for
your base existing production in that area?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
The CPC continues to be an important export route for us. It handles the majority of Kazakh crude that's
being exported to Western markets, and it represents an important supply to the world. It's about 1.4
million barrels of oil a day coming through that.
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
The oil that we put into the line from Kazakhstan carries a certificate of origin from Kazakhstan. And
we've done a lot of work in Washington and Brussels to make sure people understand the importance of
the pipeline to world supplies. And we've seen the reliability overall still and the capacity to be able to
maintain at the levels we need.
The interruptions that we've seen have been managed. We've gotten through those. And as we look
forward, we just continue to work with the Kazakh Government and with the international consortium
that owns and operates the CPC pipeline to maintain this important source of -- or export route for the
crude. There are some alternate export routes being developed, but CPC remains the primary and most
important route for us.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. Just to clarify, at the moment, operationally, at normal nameplate and flow rates through the pipe?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, we're at full capacity, both at TCO and through the CPC pipeline. They actually work quite well with
us when they do have to take the pipeline down for ongoing maintenance, which all pipelines have to do
from time to time. They coordinate with the producers. They're often coordinated with turnarounds that
the producing facilities are undergoing. So the recent downtime for CPC as they were dealing with some of
the results of the survey work around the terminal was coordinated with the NCOC turnaround activities so
that it didn't have any impact at all on TCO's production.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Jay, thank you for all the insights over the years and wish you well in your retirement, sir.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thank you.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
The first question is on capital returns. And you guys raised the top end, the buyback guidance here. So
just talk about the math that went into it, and how you think about the optimal return of capital formation,
whether it is through buybacks or dividend growth?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Neil. It's Pierre. I'll take that. I'll go through our financial priorities. They've been consistent for
decades, literally. The first financial priority is to grow the dividend. We've done that for 35 consecutive
years, increased it 6% earlier this year. It's up 20% since right before COVID, and it's doubled since 2010.
The second is to invest and grow both traditional and new energy, and you saw that our total investments
first half of the year were up 80% versus a year ago. The third is to maintain a strong balance sheet. For
the fifth consecutive quarter, we paid down debt. Our net debt ratio is at 8%. That's well below our mid-
cycle guidance of 20% to 25%.
And when we have cash in excess of those first 3 priorities, we buy back shares, and we intend to do it
ratably over the cycle. We repurchased shares, 50 now last 19 years. We bought back almost $60 billion
Copyright © 2022 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
during that time at an average price of around $90 a share, very close to the weighted average price
during that whole time. And as you said, we just increased the guidance to -- we just increased the top of
the range of our guidance to $15 billion a year. That represents about 1% of our shares each quarter.
The $15 billion annual rate is based on our current outlook. It was tested against a number of scenarios.
The rate is consistent with our Investor Day upside leverage case, which was a $75 Brent flat nominal
price over 5 years.
As we've said with previous buyback rates, we intend to maintain buybacks at this annual rate for a
number of years across the commodity cycle. As a reminder, our net debt is well below our mid-cycle
guidance range. So we'll continue buybacks even when the commodity cycle turns down, and we'll lever
back up our balance sheet closer to that 20% to 25% guidance range.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Pierre, the follow-up is just on the Permian. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the growth
profile there relative to what you guided at the beginning of the year, does the upward drift in commodity
prices change the way you're thinking about prosecuting that asset?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, I'll start out with that and then Pierre can finish if he's got any other thoughts. The Permian -- our
approach to the Permian, as you know, for many years, has been to be very disciplined, very focused on
generating the returns and the efficiency that allow us to be profitable regardless of the prices.
And so we're not responding to short-term price, but we are increasing our activity levels since the turn
down during COVID. And so we have seen our investment go up. This year, it's $1 billion higher than
it was last year. And we also see the number of wells that we're putting on production going up, we
expect to do over 200 [ POPs ] this year. And so we're looking for about a 15% increase in our Permian
production.
We've increased 2 additional rigs in July. So we're running now with a fleet of 10 rigs across the Permian in
the current time, and we expect to maintain that through the second half. But I'll remind you also one of
our rigs today drills the equivalent of what 2 rigs could do in 2018. So using just rig counts is a little bit of
a -- you have to be careful because we're so much more efficient with our rigs. And each frac crew today
is also completing roughly double the work they were doing back in 2018. So we're much more efficient
than we were just 4 years ago.
We expect to see our investment continue to grow. We've given you guidance of increasing our investment
rate up to about $4 billion a year by 2024. And then I would expect to see it relatively flat after that as
we just maintain an efficient operation across the Permian. We also have non-operated activity, and we
currently have about 9 net rigs running on the non-op side. And so that also contributes significantly to
our production profile.
Our guidance remains unchanged. We'd expect to see about 1.2 million to 1.5 million barrels a day of
production ultimately is our plateau. But as we continue to gain insights and knowledge and as we look at
our efficiencies, as we look at our portfolio and world demand, that can change as we go forward. That's
our guidance as we see it today, and we'll continue to update you as we move forward in time.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
My only add is it's also among our most carbon-efficient barrels in the portfolio. And as Jay has said, it's a
demonstration of our -- delivering on our objectives of higher returns and lower carbon.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Jay, we'd also like to wish you well, and thank you for all your time over the years. And we'll stick to 2
Upstream questions just so we can get to last in before you leave.
Our first one is on LNG. This week, there was an announcement that Chevron along with a couple of
other partners that you guys reached FID on development that will help boost Angola LNG plant volumes.
So can you talk about how you're viewing expansion opportunities in Angola and also hit on Equatorial
Guinea where you also have kind of an equity position that feeds an LNG plant there? And is there a
preference on how your involvement evolves with LNG plants because you have some ownership -- some
equity ownership, but we also know that you had a Cheniere agreement that you announced recently
that was more just on the marketing front. So just wondering how you're seeing your role there on new
opportunities.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
That was pretty good, Jeanine. I think you got 3 questions in there, and I'm going to try and merge
through those.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Oh, no. That's just one.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
I know. I'm allowed to do that. I'm the Upstream guy. Look, on the LNG in Angola, you're right, we just
took FID in the new gas consortium. There are 2 primary sources of gas for Angola LNG. Traditionally, it
was built for the associated gas that's produced along with the oil resources in Angola. And that's been the
main source of gas for Angola LNG up to this point. And we continue to develop new oil resources with our
20-year extension, just secured really good terms on both the oil and the gas. It encourages investment in
that country. There's a lot of oil still in Block 0. So that continues unabated. And actually, the investment
will move forward.
The non-associated gas. In other words, drilling and developing reservoirs that are gas only is a new
investment mode, and we're doing that through the consortium you mentioned. And that's designed to be
supplemental gas so that we can keep the Angola LNG facilities full.
And so the ongoing effort to keep that plant running, it's really economic because it builds on existing
infrastructure that's already been built, the investments have already been made. And importantly, it's
supplying needed LNG into the European market and also gives us exposure to that Atlantic Basin. So
that's been a good project for us, and we're pleased to take that FID.
In EG, again, we have exposure now to the Atlantic Basin through that project. We continue to produce
there. There's not much more I can say, other than that's also been a profitable area for us and it came to
us through the Noble acquisition. So it was kind of one of those more hidden jewels. We talk about Eastern
Med. We talk about the DJ Basin in particular. But EG is supplying a very good return to us through those
gas and LNG facilities.
In terms of our focus on ownership versus commercial, we're really pretty agnostic. We're looking for the
returns and the scale that we can build out of the business. We're looking for multiple points of supply so
that we can maintain an active and profitable portfolio.
And so where we can do commercial deals and not have to use capital, but to really be able to leverage
other facilities, that's always a nice way for us to go, and I'm pleased to get that exposure out of the Gulf
Coast into both European and potentially Asian markets. It gives us an access for a lot of our produced
gas in North America to access those markets rather than just U.S. But where it makes sense, we'll also

make investments as we have in other places and own the facilities or run them through joint venture
facilities or non-operated facilities. We really look at what gives us the best opportunity to generate the
returns we're looking for.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Great. We won't sneak in our unrelated follow-up since that was a very wholesome response.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Okay. Thanks, Jeanine.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jeanine.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
41 years in 1 place, Jay, that's pretty impressive. Congratulations.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thank you.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
I wonder if I could take maybe 2 questions for you, actually. Maybe Pierre might prefer the second one. I
want to go to the Permian first. You have about half year production operated and half non-operated. Can
you parse between the inflationary pressures between your operated and non-operated from what you're
seeing currently?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
It's difficult for me to really do that definitively. What I can say, though, is I think we have a competitive
advantage in the Permian. We have a couple of things working in our favor. We maintain a global supply
chain, and we're able to tap suppliers of both equipment and materials, goods and services over a much
broader range than maybe some of our competitors.
We also do multiyear contracts and other mechanisms commercially that allow us to mitigate some of
the inflationary pressures that we see today. And then, of course, our focus on driving for improved
productivity, improved efficiency has really helped us continue to counter the inflationary pressures.
I think the other area that we have a distinct advantage is we've been building out our infrastructure in
the Permian. And so just as a proof point, the last 800 wells over the last 5 years, to produce those 800
wells, we had to build 40 central tank batteries. As we look forward, the next 800 wells, we only need to
build an additional 4 central tank batteries. So while others are having to invest in this high inflationary
period, we're largely using infrastructure that was built over the past 5 years with very small incremental
surface facilities required. And I think that's going to be hard for others to match.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
So that's a [indiscernible] answer, very clear answer. Pierre, I don't know quite how to ask this question.
I'm going to try and get part a and part b, perhaps, I'll be respectful. Mike was interviewed recently,
talking about the tightness in the global oil market. I think you said something like I know to put words in
his mouth, but any weakness in oil prices is going to be fleeting because of the under investment. And you
guys obviously have stepped up your spending from COVID levels, but you're still well below pre-COVID
levels '16 through '19, let's say.
With your balance sheet where it is in the depth of opportunities that you obviously have that you're not
funding, how should we think about your continued commitment to the current CapEx level? Or do we see
Chevron reengage in organic growth at some point?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
You should think that there's no change in our guidance. There's -- our 2022 capital is on track. It's likely
to end up below our $15 billion budget. We've been ramping up during the course of the first half of the
year, and I think you'll see us higher in the second half of the year, but likely end the year below our $15
billion budget.
Our guidance that we shared at our March Investor Day is $15 billion to $17 billion of organic capital
investments through 2026. Our budget this year is around $15 billion. So we have $2 billion of room to
increase activity and investment within the guidance. And then as Jay just described, our major capital
project in Kazakhstan is winding down. It will decrease spending by about $1 billion, and that opens up
another $1 billion.
So we have -- we will increase investment in activity next year. I expect that we're doing that work right
now. We'll share the details in December when it's finalized and approved by the Board. But we'll increase
it within the guidance. And that guidance enables us to sustain and grow the Upstream business, as we've
talked about, 3% compounded annual growth rate between now and 2026.
Add to our refinery capacity. We bought a refinery in Pasadena, Texas in 2019, kept all of our U.S.
refineries through COVID and are making investment in that Pasadena refinery that was just recently FID-
ed.
And of course, all the activities we're doing to grow new energies. We can do all of that within the
guidance. And as we recognize, Jay, one of the things he deserves a lot of credit for is our Upstream
business is much more capital efficient than it's ever been. And has a mindset of how do we deliver
business results with less capital. And if we do that, there's more free cash flow for shareholders.
Operator
We'll take our next question from John Royall with JPMorgan.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Can you talk about your growth in the Gulf of Mexico in the Upstream? You're leaning in there with
number of brownfield projects. So can you just speak broadly on how you view on within your portfolio,
and how the returns look on those bolt-ons relative to your other options globally in the Upstream? And
then what does the service inflation picture look like in that part of your system relative to, say, the
Permian?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thank you, John. I'll start this and let Pierre add in. But we're really quite pleased with the portfolio we
maintain in the Gulf of Mexico. It's a good area of exploration for us. And it has some of the lowest carbon
intensity in the world. It's about 6 kilograms of equivalent per barrel produced. So on a world scale, and
even our company scale, which is already top quartile, it's right at the bottom end of that range. So this is
a great area to develop for future production and carbon efficiency.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
When we look at the queue of projects we have, we've got the Anchor project that is expecting to have
first oil in 2024. We've got Whale, is coming through. We expect in 2024. We've been expanding our
existing facilities. We're starting up the waterflood at St. Malo, which is part of the Jack/St. Malo complex.
We've installed our multiphase pumps and are commissioning those. That's going to be an important
milestone technologically and our ability to step out further and further.
We just took FID at Ballymore. And Ballymore is an interesting one because it was a nice size discovery,
but we could really capitalize and get a much higher return by taking 3 wells back to a host facility, at
Blind Faith and be able to develop that. So we're pleased to be able to see that higher return coming from
Blind Faith. And it also helps our existing production at Blind Faith.
As we continue to work forward, I think we're going to see growth in our Gulf of Mexico production, but
it's going to be important that we continue to be able to lease and acquire additional acreage in that basin,
along with others because there's still, I think, room for continual exploration and tie back to this great
chain of infrastructure that we have, be able to produce this lower carbon fuel.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Only add is our rigs were largely contracted when rates are lower. So clearly, offshore rigs have increased,
but we're largely contracted at prior rates.
John Macalister Royall
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Yes. So on the Downstream, I just had a question on particularly California, just kind of your go-forward
views there. Product balance is not quite as tight as they are in other parts of the country. But then we're
seeing some capacity come out due to RD conversions there. And so just looking for maybe your medium-
term view on refining and California specifically?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
On the Downstream side, we had a strong quarter. Well, good execution, reliable operations, high refinery
utilization, and I'm talking generally now, U.S. West Coast and Gulf Coast, good cost control, and we're
able to capture the margins in the marketplace. We had a slight benefit in the second quarter because
the Richmond turnaround was deferred. So it was a little bit less of an impact than what we had guided to
on the first quarter call. And timing effects really weren't a driver, right, timing is more of the absence of
timing effects that you saw.
In terms of these markets, they're volatile right now. I mean, we've seen margins come off from where
they were before. In the second quarter, we saw a demand response. On gasoline, probably around the
mid-single digits across the U.S., a little bit higher on the West Coast, a little bit lower in the Gulf Coast. I
didn't really see much on the diesel side. And Jet is really tied to the recovery of travel.
So we'll just see where the market takes us, whether it's West Coast or Gulf Coast, we're focused on safe,
reliable operations, continuing to have good cost control and delivering products that our customers are
demanding.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I have one on the Upstream portfolio and then one on the financials. On the Upstream, can you just talk
about your other gas opportunities that you have available in the queue. Specifically, I'm thinking about
the Eastern Med. I know you're delineating some acreage there, and it seems like there's a lot of gas

available to exploit. And then also, I believe you have a Haynesville position. I'm not sure if that's in the
money or not [indiscernible] that you're looking at. And then I'll ask my follow-up after.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We have a lot of gas opportunities, and we've got a lot of infrastructure to build those opportunities
on, which is really important because it gives us an advantage from a return standpoint. In the Eastern
Med, which I'll add, is one of the lowest carbon intensity areas from a Scope 1 and Scope 2. We're at 2
kilograms of carbon equivalent per barrel produced.
We have, of course, supplied a lot of gas into the Israeli market and that opportunity continues to grow
as coal is displaced. We also take that gas into Jordan for conversion to electric power. And now we're
taking it into Egypt, work and supply, both domestic needs in Egypt, but also potentially access some of
the ullage that exists in the LNG facilities that are already existing in Egypt.
We're considering floating LNG as well. As you know, there are very benign conditions, [ Med Ocean ]
conditions in the Mediterranean that lend themselves to floating LNG. So it represents a viable option for
us.
Developing additional gas capacity at Leviathan and Tamar is well within the scope of those projects and
would allow us to access these additional marketing opportunities through the LNG and the flexibility that
provides.
We continue to have some upside potential in additional fields through EG. And then we've got access, as
you pointed out, in the United States. We are ramping up our drilling activity in the Haynesville, and we
expect to see rigs there starting later this year. They'll be working in that area. It was very profitable even
at the low prices, it's profitable now.
So again, our focus is going to be on discipline on continuing to drive for those efficiencies, but we really
are excited to get Haynesville underway and add that to our portfolio in that part of the country.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Great. And my follow-up is just on the share count. I believe it went up again this quarter despite the
buyback. And it's gone up since the buyback started. I think if you back out the shares issued for Noble,
it's been flattish. So can you just discuss exactly what's going on there and your expectations for their
share count moving forward with the higher buyback, but also at a higher share price?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The share count is going down and will go down. What you see in the earnings press release is a
weighted average during the course of the quarter, not necessarily the end of the quarter. So you'll see in
our Q that the share count at the end of second quarter is, in fact, lower than the first quarter, which you'd
expect as we bought back 2.5 billion shares and issued [ 0.8 ].
The first quarter, we had this very large issuances for our employees and retirees exercising stock options.
And so we started the year with a lower share count, issued those for our employee retiree stock options.
Therefore, started second quarter at a higher rate and then worked our way down.
So the math does work. It is going down. It's -- you have to look at end of quarter to end of quarter. But
what you see in terms of earnings per share, it's an average over the quarter, and it's kind of a quirk that
second quarter average was higher than the first quarter, but just the nature of the pattern during the
quarter. Share counts are going down.

Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
My first question here is, I wanted to take expertise from Jay again. This was a heavy turnaround quarter
for you. But even then, some of the things where you were turning around were very high-margin
barrels for you, so whether it was TCO, Angola or Wheatstone. And help us understand, like in terms of
opportunity cost, if this volume was somewhere in the lower margin business versus some of your higher-
margin business because you're trying to say Upstream results were good, but they could have been even
better because some of the higher-margin barrels were actually in a turnaround.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
I appreciate the question. One of the things that's really important to us is that we operate safely and
reliably. And so we look and we schedule our turnarounds, and they're predominantly to ensure asset
integrity and ongoing reliable performance. And when we schedule those, we don't like to shift those
because of market conditions. And so we tend to want to execute those on time.
What's important is that we execute them within the time frames that we expected so that our production
is in accordance with our planning. And both Wheatstone and Angola LNG were done really, really well. I
was proud of our teams, they went in, they did the turnaround.
This means now in Australia, all 5 trains have been through the first round of turnarounds. And so that's
an important milestone, an important accomplishment. This work that we do, while it may seem like
we're giving up some opportunities in the near term, it allows us to continue to drive higher and higher
reliability, which means our overall production will be higher and our costs will be lower and our safety will
be higher. And so that's really how we think about this.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
And I have a quick policy question. About 1.5 months ago, things got a little heated between the oil
companies and the White House. But as we understand, when the actual executive meetings happen
between you guys and all the others and the secretary of energy, those are pretty cordial and you guys
are looking for solutions out there. Help us understand what happened in the meeting with energy
secretary and how did those go?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Manav, we won't comment on the specifics of our engagements. I think you're right that we're -- it's
constructive and productive. I'll point out our U.S. oil and gas production in the first half of the year was
up 7% versus last year. Our U.S. refined product sales up 10% versus last year. The administration wants
energy supplies to increase, we're doing that. Our investment globally, up 80% first half of the year. If
you look at the U.S., more than double when you include REG. So Chevron is growing energy supply,
increasing investment, and we're engaging constructively with Congress and this administration.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Just one for me on Australia. I mean there's gas shortages in many geographies in Europe, in particular,
but there's been some talk about or noise around that in Australia. I wanted to understand whether we
should expect any export issues at Gorgon and Wheatstone? Are you in discussions with the government
around proportion of gas against domestic market versus what's being exported or anything like that? So
any color would be great.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Biraj. The shortages that you've heard about in Australia are all on the East Coast, and there
are no pipelines connecting the West Coast and the East Coast. So actually, the only way that we could
supply any gas to the East Coast of Australia is in the form of LNG. So we are under long-term contract
with customers throughout Asia. We also sell into the spot markets with those facilities. We have interest
in Northwest Shelf as well as, of course, Wheatstone and Gorgon. The Western Australian market is well
supplied. It's a part of our agreements for that supply. And so there really are no issues. I don't see any
impact to our export capabilities in Australia.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Okay. Understood. And just a follow-up on the same topic. A couple of years ago, I think I had a
conversation with Pierre around the potential for increasing nameplate capacity at Gorgon and Wheatstone
over time. And as you go through the various debottlenecking exercises, are you able to provide an update
on whether that's still in the works, where you are, and what kind of time line that would be on, if that's
possible.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. We continue to focus on incremental capacity increases at both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And that can
happen through expansion of debottlenecking where we actually expand the capacity of the facilities. But
importantly, it also happens as we increase the reliability of facilities, and their utilization is higher.
If you just look at this year, we've supplied 87 cargoes. As I said, that's up 10% on production from last
year, even with the turnaround that we had. So you can see the improvement happening there. We have
seen capacity increases at both Wheatstone and Gordon, and I would expect those to continue as we
move forward.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
I wanted to revisit the LNG topic and maybe specifically tie it to the Permian because there's just a lot of
resource in the Permian that's not commercial, and that's -- that includes different zones of what you're
already developing plus areas that are not on your development calendar in the near term. And LNG didn't
historically help with that because it's expensive, but obviously, things have changed now. And so I just
love your perspective on what happens to your Permian resource or your overall opportunity there or the
duration of it in an environment where you can add some extra capital or even commit to a spread, but
monetize gas for a double-digit price.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Look, I would characterize it what determines our pace of activity in the Permian is a balance on what
we can accomplish efficiently. We have a factory model all the way from land acquisition. We do deals all
the time to fill in the checkerboards and ensure an efficient development plan. As an example, just since
2017, we've executed over 260 transactions that have added 3,500 long laterals. That's allowed us to
drive for this efficiency and the higher returns.
Our activity levels really aren't determined by how much we can export from the United States. All these
projects that we have would be economic at much lower prices. So it's really not the price that's unlocking
the Permian, it's developing the infrastructure for export from the basin into the markets that we supply,
both domestic and international.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
So it's all done in a coordinated fashion. We do it. So we stay within the capability of the organization
to execute efficiently and safely. And that's really what drives the Permian. So it's nice to have access
to these additional markets and the optionality they provide. We have an advantage in working closely
with our midstream group, who has great capability, both again for the domestic offtake and setting
up potential for international export, but it's really not what I would view as the limiting factor on our
pace. We determine that based on our overall balance of free cash flow, the returns and our resource and
reserve replenishment.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. And then, I mean, maybe just to follow up, like, are there any ancillary factors that might be a
consideration like an opportunity to fit another CCUS project on a facility or what it might contribute to like
a flaring mitigation effort or anything besides just, like you said, a price signal?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
As Pierre said earlier, the Permian actually has very good carbon intensity on a Scope 1 and 2 basis. We're
at 15 kilograms of CO2 across the basin. We're now benchmarking our facilities and achieving certification
of platinum status on most facilities with Project Canary, which then provides independent third-party
certification of our methane emissions and the performance that we have been talking about.
We are working with both our Chevron Technology Ventures, which is our venture capital arm and our New
Energies segment on the carbon capture and sequestration. And carbon capture, in particular, is critically
important for not just us but the world. And so we have 3 pilots going on at San Joaquin Valley operations
to capture the CO2 that's coming off of our cogen units there.
And then, of course, we're gaining experience at Gorgon and Quest up in Canada, where we learn more
and more about what it takes to effectively and efficiently sequester CO2 into storage. So these are all
going on. The beauty of having a portfolio like we do is we can put these pilot projects and we can put
these demonstration projects wherever it makes the most sense, both from a regulatory, fiscal and return
standpoint and develop these technologies that we're all going to need going forward.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Irene Himona with Societe General.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
I wanted to ask, first of all, about what you're seeing on the ground in terms of any signs of persistent
demand destruction at retail, but also at industrial customer level, please?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Irene, I said it very quickly earlier, I mean, we've seen, I would call it, demand response to higher prices
that in the second quarter was about in the mid-single digits in the U.S. on gasoline. Again, a little higher
on the West Coast, a little lower on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And I think we've seen some recovery since
because prices have come off, so we'll see where our third quarter ends up. On diesel, it's very hard to
see, not price sensitive, it's tied to commercial industrial activity, maybe a little bit of a response at retail
diesel.
And then [ jet ] is largely tied to the recovery in air travel. I think people are wanting to get out and
see people and places. Asia, where we also have retail is a little more variable because there's been still
COVID restrictions, and so it's hard to kind of see the data. I mean what's interesting is there's obviously
concerns around the recession. In terms of tailwinds, we still have very low unemployment, and we have a
consumer that wants to spend money to go out and do things they haven't been able to do for a couple of
years.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
When prices were higher in the second quarter, they made some choices. And if you look at that demand
response on gasoline, that's in line or even higher than some past recession. So it's not clear. I guess what
I'd say is demand, I think, will be much more recession resilient going forward just because we've seen
a little bit of that response in the second quarter. And again, diesel will be tied to underlying commercial
activity. And I think jet will really depend on if the airlines can get all the flights scheduled and have pilots
and all the rest and some of the challenges that have been happening over there.
So that's a little bit of a sense of the demand. We saw a response second quarter, seeing some of it come
back here early third quarter, and we'll just see where it goes from here.
Irene Himona
Societe Generale Cross Asset Research
For my follow-up, and as you mentioned you're launching some new carbon capture projects. I wanted to
go back to Australia and ask if you can possibly talk around the recent performance at the Gorgon carbon
capture project. Is utilization improving? And is there any read through perhaps on the technical side from
that project to the ones you're launching now?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Irene. At Gorgon, we've now stored successfully about 6.6 million tons of CO2 into that reservoir.
The -- ironically, the biggest issue we're having currently is just the ability to remove water at a sufficient
rate from the storage reservoir to create the space for the CO2 to enter. We've already demonstrated the
capacity and capability to inject full CO2 rates into that reservoir, but the water that we're producing has
some solids in it and some other contaminants, ironically, oil and gas, because it's an oil and gas basin.
And we need the surface facilities that can just remove those before that water is injected into a third
reservoir..
These are not new or particularly high technology challenges at all. It's what we deal with in everyday life
around the world. So it's just -- it's compounded a little bit because Gordon sequestration is in a Class A
nature reserve, so it's a very cumbersome process to approve additional facilities and additional wells.
But these problems are solvable. And they do not represent, in my view, any kind of a restriction on the
viability of carbon sequestration as a means of storing CO2 for long periods.
What I would expect is that and we said this before, as we learn, as we go through this, what it's teaching
us is that there are uncertainty ranges on any reservoir, whether you're producing from it or injecting
into it and having sufficient contingencies and mitigations, depending on where you find yourself in those
uncertainty ranges when you actually put the facility into operation is important, and we'll need to keep
these in mind as we develop sequestration projects around the world.
So the science is good. The technology works. It's just the basic issues that we face on reservoirs around
the world that we now need to overcome.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
Two questions. First, you touched on the inflation in different parts of your business. But can you give
an over or -- given your footprint, can you give us an overall view that what is sure on expectation on
the inflation for next year? I know it's still early for your budget, but are we talking about 10%, 15%?
Some of your largest suppliers seems to suggest that everything is all used up in terms of manpower
and equipment. So I don't know whether that you agree with that assessment. And if you can tell us that
where you see along the supply chain is the biggest maybe pass upon and where that you see the least
inflationary pressure? So that's the first question.
The second question on Mexico and Brazil. You guys entered I think a couple of years ago and had some
block over there. But I haven't heard you guys talk too much about those. So where those rank within
your portfolio today? And what is the next step in those?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Paul. I'll take the first, and then I'll hand it to Jay on the second. On the onshore U.S., we've
seen cost inflation this year in the single digits. We've been able to mitigate a part of that through good
planning, smart procurement and good relationships with suppliers. And as Jay pointed out, we've been
able to also get more efficient with our drilling and completion operations, which also partially offsets it.
Outside of the U.S., we're seeing much more modest inflation, and we talked about our Gulf of Mexico
offshore rigs, which were contracted at a time when the rig rates were lower. As we're looking towards
2023, we're doing that work right now. We're confident that we'll be able to secure all the goods and
services that were needed for our program. Again, our program will be a higher activity program next
year, and that includes the Permian.
And we'll share estimates of what we're seeing in terms of, COGS inflation when we disclose our CapEx
budget in December. We're just in the middle of that work right now, I feel very good that we'll have all
the goods and services that we need, and we're finalizing our plans. Jay?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. Thanks. And Paul, in terms of Mexico and Brazil, we have not had exploration, significant discoveries
there. We are turning our attention, I would say, towards Egypt, where we have a very nice exploration
position. We're shooting seismic. These are in areas that have been unexplored before because they've
been in restricted areas and now available to us. As well as in Suriname. So as we do in exploration, we're
always going through and looking for the next opportunities, but I would say our focus primarily is shifting
now towards Egypt and Suriname. Thanks for the question.
Operator
We'll take our last question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Thanks. Maybe first one on the biofuel side. You now closed both the [ REG ] and the Bunge deals within
that business. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in those markets? And whether you
can elaborate at all about the broad types of commercial opportunities that you see that you mentioned in
your prepared remarks?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Ryan. We're really excited to welcome REG's people to Chevron and CJ Warner to our Board. She's
already participated in our first Board meeting, is fantastic, has great knowledge of traditional and new
energy businesses, and it's just a great add to our Board.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2022 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 29, 2022
As I said, we've had some sort of early wins. I won't get into the details of the commercial opportunities,
but what we saw in the combination, the strength that REG has in terms of feedstock acquisition primarily
of waste oils, and then combining that with our retail and marketing footprint. And just bringing 2 great
teams together, we're seeing, as you'd expect, 1 plus 1 is more than 2. We've got our renewable fuels
business headquartered in Ames, Iowa. And we're very excited about it.
We closed in mid-June, just a comment on the accounting. There were no results in our second quarter
results because we chose a convenience day of June 30. So all you'll see and all you saw in our earnings
release, and you'll see in the Q is just the purchase accounting starting in third quarter, then we'll see REG
in our results.
REG had a good second quarter. Margins have been bouncing around, but the results are largely in line
with expectations, and Geismar continues on track. And same thing with Bunge, operating 2 crushers,
very excited to be part of that, invested in CoverCress jointly, which is a crop that won't compete with
food.
So lots of work in this space as we work to get our renewable fuels capability up to 100,000 barrels a day.
Still working, still on track to convert diesel hydrotreater at El Segundo to have renewable fuel capability
and work across other parts of Chevron systems. So the combination of REG, our Bunge joint venture and
our own assets, along with our customer relationships, we're all putting that together to have what we
think will be a very successful, viable renewable fuels business.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Thanks, Pierre. Maybe the final one for Jay. Congrats on the retirement. I wanted to ask the kind of
a higher level question on Upstream project development and technology. And there's been a pretty
significant shift over the last 5 to 10 years and the way that you've approached project development,
more standardization, oftentimes smaller and more capital-efficient style projects. Ballymore is a great
example of this. It's lowered the cost of supply a lot, especially in the deepwater.
As you pass the baton and look forward kind of into the next 10 years, are there -- are there things that
you can see on the horizon, either strategically or technologies that may continue to drive -- changes in
project development and technology that may drive things forward even further, whether it's 20,000 kit in
the deepwater sort of from flow line improvements and a lot of longer tiebacks. And what could this mean
for the future of your resource development portfolio?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks for the question, and it's pretty exciting. I mean the one bad thing about retirement is you don't
get to be part of the next steps, and I'm excited about them. I would start by just saying, I think we've
accomplished a mindset shift in Chevron, and this is throughout our workforce, being very focused on
returns, not chasing a production target, but continuing to run this as a business and thinking about the
returns we can get. Scale is important, but it's an outcome of the opportunity set that we have and the
investments and capital that we choose to invest.
Getting more focused, the factory model has been really important to us. And ironically, this started where
we drilled lots of wells in places like Duri and San Joaquin. We've now successfully transferred that into
our unconventional plays in Permian, in the DJ, in Duvernay and Argentina. And now we're actually taking
that factory model into places like the Gulf of Mexico, where we do what we call urban planning, and we
try and have a steady progression of projects, and we're developing the capability for further and further
reach.
I mentioned earlier that Jack/St. Malo is now putting into service multiphase pumps. And these multiphase
pumps sit on the sea floor, but they allow us to reach 30, 40 and even maybe 50 miles out from a host
facility, which really gives us great capacity to make even smaller accumulations economic, and give us
the returns we're looking for while extending the life of these major hubs. I think the Gulf of Mexico will

continue to be an important proving ground for some of these technologies that can then be exported
around the world.
So our focus on standardization, our focus on minimum viable facilities, our focus on capital efficiency over
just scale and NPV, all these together are resulting in and aligning with our technology center, so that we
continue to develop the technologies that are giving us the returns that we're going to need going forward.
And with the resource base that we have today, and the team of people that we have in our technology
groups and in our businesses, I'm really excited.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Ryan, thanks for that question. We will miss Jay, but his legacy will live on, and you'll see it in the
performance that the Upstream has been delivering and will continue to deliver.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is
being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation,
Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber,
are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's
website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Roderick. Before we turn to first quarter results, I'd like to recognize the people of
Ukraine. Our hearts go out to those affected by this tragedy, and we hope for a prompt and enduring
diplomatic resolution.
The last 2 years have been volatile and unpredictable, driven by the global pandemic and geopolitical
conflict, creating strains on economies and markets around the world. Through it all, our objectives have
been clear and consistent. And in the first quarter, we continued to make progress, delivering book returns
in the mid-teens, investing to grow both our traditional and new energy businesses and returning even
more cash to shareholders while maintaining an industry-leading balance sheet.
Recent events remind us of the importance of energy. Looking forward, I know that Chevron is doing
its part, raising this year's Permian production outlook and advancing 2 important renewable fuel
transactions: our Bunge JV, which is expected to close shortly; and the Renewable Energy Group
acquisition, which is expected to close around midyear.
While the future is uncertain, our actions are not. We're on a path to delivering higher returns and lower
carbon and rewarding our stakeholders all along the way.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre to discuss our financials.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We reported first quarter earnings of $6.3 billion or $3.22 per share. Adjusted earnings
were $6.5 billion or $3.36 per share. Included in the current quarter were pension settlement costs
totaling $66 million and negative foreign currency effects exceeding $200 million. A reconciliation of non-
GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation. Adjusted ROCE was over 15% and our
net debt ratio is below 11%.
A third consecutive quarter with free cash flow over $6 billion, enabled us to return $4 billion to
shareholders and further pay down debt. In addition, during the quarter, we received over $4 billion in
cash, when about 3,000 current and former employees exercise stock options. This quarter's proceeds

from option exercises were over 4x the historical annual average of around $1 billion per year. About 2/3
of the vest adoptions at year-end 2021 were exercised during the first quarter, lowering the potential
future rate of dilution from the outstanding balance. Over time, we expect our share buybacks to more
than offset the first quarter dilutive effect.
Adjusted first quarter earnings were up $4.8 billion versus last quarter -- versus last year. Adjusted
upstream earnings increased mainly on higher realizations while adjusted downstream earnings increased
primarily on higher margins, partially offset by negative timing effects. Compared with last quarter,
adjusted earnings were up more than $1.6 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings increased primarily on
higher realizations and the absence of certain fourth quarter DD&A charges. Liftings were lower in part
due to lower production in the Gulf of Mexico.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily on timing effects. The All Other segment was down
primarily on unfavorable tax items and higher corporate charges. The All Other segment results can vary
between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.
First quarter oil equivalent production decreased 2% year-on-year due to the expiration of Rokan in
Indonesia, lower production in Thailand as we approach the end of the concession and lower entitlements
due to higher prices. Permian growth in the absence of Winter Storm Uri, impacts partially offset and
drove U.S. oil and gas production up over 10%.
Now looking ahead. In the second quarter, we expect lower production due to planned turnarounds at
Wheatstone and Angola LNG, impacts from CPC pipeline and the expiration of the Area 1 concession in
Thailand. At CPC, 2 of the 3 single port moorings are now back in service and TCO has returned to full
operations. Downtime associated with the April repairs is estimated to be less than 15% of our second
quarter turnaround and downtime guidance.
We anticipate a return of capital between $250 million and $350 million from Angola LNG in the second
quarter. This cash is reported through cash from investing and not cash from operations. In the first
quarter, Angola LNG returned over $500 million of capital. The differences between affiliate earnings and
dividends are not ratable and TCO has not yet declared a dividend in 2022. With higher commodity prices,
affiliate dividends are expected to be $1 billion higher than our previous guidance.
We've utilized our NOLs and other U.S. tax attributes and expect to make estimated U.S. federal and state
income tax payments in the second quarter. These payments will flow through working capital accounts,
just like our first quarter IRS refunded. In the second quarter, we expect to invest $600 million as we close
the Bunge joint venture and to repurchase shares at the top of our guidance range.
With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Mike, I want to start with one for you on Tengiz. There have been a number of events here in the quarter
from the social unrest earlier in the quarter to the CPC pipeline uncertainty and the moorings issues. So
I recognize production seems to be back up and running to normal now. But I'm curious how you think
about this in terms of the broader implications of what has been happening on the ground there? And it's
a very important asset for Chevron. So what are your latest thoughts?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Phil, it's an important asset, not just to our company but to the Republic of Kazakhstan and, frankly,
to world energy markets in Europe, in particular. It's a significant supplier at a time when there are
concerns about supply security that you're very familiar with. So we're focused on safe and reliable
operations, as you would expect, protecting people in the environment and our assets, executing the
major project, that's underway. And working with all the stakeholders that are involved in this. So that
includes partners, it includes, obviously, the government of Kazakhstan and our customers.
So the risks that I think you're referring to are risks that are present in Kazakhstan and in varying
degrees, in other parts of the world as well. And that's part of what we do is manage those risks on the
ground each and every day. There are times when the environment feels a bit more benign, but you can't
take your eyes off those risks because they can materialize at any point.
So to this point in time, we've been able to make good progress on the project. Some impact really from
the weather-related downtime at the loading buoys at lower [indiscernible]. But 2 of those are back in
service and the third one is slated for repair, which would give us plenty of redundant capacity there.
So we continue to stay very focused on every aspect of managing that our people on the ground are
empowered to do what it takes and to be very responsive in real time. And I'm incredibly proud of the
work that they've done in a very challenging environment.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Understood. I appreciate your thoughts. My second question would be for Pierre on cash flows or cash
balances. The quarter did come in a bit lower than expected on cash flows, and I think you highlighted
some timing factors. But you did get a bunch of cash from the stock vesting. So cash balances are up
quite significantly. So I was wondering, I don't know if there's anything else to highlight on the moving
pieces of the cash flow. But even at strip prices with your buybacks, it seems like cash balances will keep
going up. So just what are your latest thoughts on managing the cash from here?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Phil. First, let me just talk about cash in the quarter. Cash in the quarter was very strong. As I
pointed out, our dividends from affiliates are not ratable. And particularly from TCO, which historically
has paid dividends in the fourth quarter, we increased our guidance on expected dividends, but they were
light in the first quarter. So yes, that's timing. I also pointed out that Angola LNG returned $500 million of
capital. That's essentially operating cash. That's a function of operating an LNG facility and selling it into
the European gas markets at TTF prices.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 6
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
However, adjusted to the accounting rules, it's flowing through cash from investing and not cash from ops.
But for all intents and purposes, it is operating cash flow. And at some point in time in the future, it might
revert back to that depending on the retained earnings in that affiliate. Another item I did not mention is
that it's a typical item that happens in the first quarter. We pay out our long-term incentive compensation,
which a portion of that is in the form of restricted stock and performance shares.
That is, again, happens annually, but with a higher stock price, that was a higher payment than in
previous years. That does not flow through working capital. That comes out of a long-term liability
account. And then as I mentioned, we expect to make estimated tax payments next quarter, but that will
flow through working capital in many of analysts would gather our cash flow ex working capital. But our
IRS refund also went through working capital that we had guided to in the first quarter.
In terms of our cash balances, we're running a little bit high on our cash balance. That's why we refer to
net debt, but we have a couple of cash items coming up. We expect to close REG around midyear. That's
$3 billion. And we have an offering up right now to do a make whole call on about $3 billion of bonds.
These are bonds that are economic to call back. And then on the buybacks, I mean, we just increased
our buyback guidance at our Investor Day back in March to $5 billion to $10 billion. We were at $5 billion
rate here in the first quarter. We're doubling it now to the top of the range of $10 billion, and we'll just see
where the environment goes from here.
We are not setting -- we are setting the buyback at a rate that we can maintain across the commodity
cycle. We could have a higher buyback rate this quarter or next quarter, but the goal is not to maximize
the buyback rate in any individual quarter. It's to set it at a level that we can maintain when the cycle
turns. And therefore, we can rebalance our net debt ratio closer to our mid-cycle guidance.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So the first one I wanted to ask is just on the Permian results and guidance increase. I was wondering if
you could talk through in a bit more detail some of the drivers there. Are you adding activity? Is it better
performance on the activity you already had budgeted for? Is it nonoperated? Just walk through some of
the drivers there and how you're thinking about that.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Devin, we did have a strong first quarter and a couple of big things to bear in mind there. As we
slowed things down in 2020, when demand contracted due to the pandemic, what happened is we ended
up with an inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that grew beyond what would be kind of a normal
run rate for our rig fleet. And so we've been working through that and we're back down now to what
you could think of as a more normal factory model. We always want to have docks out in front of the
completion crews but that had grown to a larger than normal rate.
So as we've caught that up, that's pretty efficient. It's the first place you turn as you see the cycle turn is
completing those wells to get that production online, and we'll be moving into more of a factory model. So
it will level out a little bit versus what might feel like a little bit of a surge. We also get some nonratable
joint venture bookings that show up. And so both of those contributed to a very strong first quarter.
And of course, by the time you look at how that would roll through in the continued activity for the rest
of this year, it's pretty clear that we'll end up higher than the initial guidance that we had put out. So --
but we haven't stepped up our program. We haven't stepped up a number of rigs. We haven't stepped up
spending. It's all really a function of getting the machine running again. And then underneath that, there's
ongoing efficiency improvements that we continue to see.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is on your global gas and LNG portfolio. And I was
wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're looking at some of the medium and longer-
term opportunities there given what's going on in markets? And specifically, I'm thinking about Eastern
Med and that gas position. And then also whether or not integration into some type of LNG facility in the
U.S. might make sense for some of your production growth there as well?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So LNG is on everybody's mind these days. It's important to meeting Europe's needs. It's important
to delivering a lower carbon energy system globally, and we see this strong market here in the near term.
Eastern Med is a wonderful asset. I was just over there 2 weeks ago. I visited the Leviathan platform,
spent a lot of time with our people in the business there. And they've recently completed a project to
increase infrastructure access to regional markets and we're actually flowing more gas into Egypt as a
result of that.
We're looking at a number of other opportunities to further increased production because the resource
there is quite prolific. And that includes further coal-to-gas switching in Israel for the regional supply into
neighboring countries, for potential power generation for power distribution through the region, floating
LNG, potentially using oilage in other LNG facilities in the region, a number of different commercial options
that are being evaluated and worked.
So more to come as those mature, but it's an area of high priority for us because the market demand
for it. When you look at the U.S., clearly, we've got a lot of gas production here that largely prices at
Henry Hub today. And there are these projects that are in the process for LNG export facilities. We've had
discussions with a number of those developers, nothing to say more than we've had discussions at this
point.
But that's part of our LNG portfolio that we've been very focused on the Pacific Basin historically. And as
the Atlantic Basin markets now look a little bit different as we flow gas from our West African assets into
the Atlantic Basin, it may make sense for us to have some U.S. supply as well. So we'll advise you as we
advance anything there.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Mike, I just love your perspective on the oil macro. You always have a good read on it. It strikes us that
inventories for product and oil are very tight right now. You've got jet fuel recovering over the summer.
We'll see what happens in China. Shale has an inelastic supply response. So how does this ultimately
resolve itself in the near term? Do you ultimately need to solve or demand destruction through crack or
flat price of oil? Or is there something that we're missing?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
No, Neil. I mean you're putting your finger on all the levers. If you step back from it, supply always
responds more slowly than demands does. And in normal times, which we have not been in for the last
couple of years, both of them kind of gradually move in relative sympathy with one another. You've got
storage out there that can buffer any near-term imbalances. I'm repeating what you all know. But in 2020,
we saw a contraction unlike anything I've seen in my lifetime. And we had to really constrain activity.
There was no sense producing more oil when the world needed a lot less.
And it wasn't clear at the time how long that might last and how deep it would be. And so the entire
industry, every segment of the industry responded to that. And then as we've come out of the pandemic,
demand growth has surged. And as you say, we haven't seen it all come back yet. Air travel, while it's --

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
domestic air travel in the U.S. is pretty strong, international air travel still has a ways to go to recover to
pre-pandemic levels.
And then China and other parts of the world are still in various stages of lockdown at various points
in time. And so we haven't seen a full recovery of demand there. So even with that, demand has now
responded more quickly than supply can match it. And then you overlay a host of other issues, right?
The independent E&Ps feeling more of an obligation to return cash to their shareholders. Some of the big
integrated companies have reprioritized new energy versus traditional energy and have indicated they
intend to shrink rather than grow their oil and gas production.
And then the NOCs going around the world, everybody has got a little bit of a different situation. So it's a
market that is not stable. It's not an equilibrium. Right now, as you say, inventories are quite low. Demand
is still strong, and economies to this point seem to be handling it. At some point, particularly if prices were
to move higher, I do think it starts to be a bigger drag on the economy than what we've seen to this point.
But there's a lot of attention in this market and the supply response is coming. We're up 10% in the U.S.
year-on-year. We're working on the big project in Kazakhstan, which will start up over the next couple of
years. And others around the world have got things that they're doing as well. But it just comes in at a
different pace than the demand has moved. And I think we're in a market that's tight right now, that has
a lot of uncertainty and I think that is not likely to resolve itself in the near term, the uncertainty. Things
like the SPR release in the near term can do a certain amount to call those markets. But over time, it's
a cyclical business. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced at prices lower than we see
today.
And one of the lessons in history is just as the bad times don't last forever, neither do the times when
prices are strong, and so we can't start to believe they'll always be like this. But I think in the relative
short term here, the tensions that you referred to are likely to remain.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
It's a great perspective, Mike. Another big picture question is, if you think about 20 years ago at the
beginning of the last super cycle, you had very similar, very large multiple arbitrages between the super
majors and even large independents and some of the majors. And one could look at your multiple on
consensus and say you trade a premium relative to a lot of the global majors. Do you think there's value
in mega M&A in the space? And do you see yourself as a logical consolidator, given that M&A is such a core
competency and it worked out incredibly well for you 20 years ago with Texaco?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. We're always looking at these things, Neil. I think history would suggest that deals done in an
upcycle or near the top of the cycle don't necessarily look as well in hindsight as deals that were done in
a different part of the cycle. 20 years ago, when there was a number of transactions that you referred to,
we were coming out of oil prices in the teens or the 20s. And so consolidation made sense. There were a
lot of synergies to be harvested as you put some of these companies together. I think the entire industry
is more efficient today than it was then certainly large companies, which you refer to kind of large-scale
M&A.
And so I think the synergy opportunities, while no doubt there would be some, they may not be of the
same magnitude that they were 20 years ago. We've all used technology and other things to improve the
efficiency of our operations. So I never say never, but I don't know that just because we're trading at a
relatively strong multiple right now that, that should lead you to believe that it means we're more likely to
do something that our track record of discipline would suggest.

We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Our first question, maybe we just hit back on cash returns. The buyback for 2Q annualized again, is at
the top of your range. And Pierre, I think you reiterated on Phil's question that buybacks are intended to
be through the cycle. Can you just maybe provide a little bit of commentary on how you're viewing the
buyback in relation to mid-cycle cash flow?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jeanine. The buyback rate of $10 billion is a company record, and previous highest buyback rate
was back in 2008. And as you say, we want to maintain it across the commodity cycle. So we're very in
tune with what our mid-cycle cash flow capabilities are. We showed at our Investor Day low case of $50
Brent and so that we can maintain the buyback for multiple years, even though $50 is notionally right
around the breakeven for covering both our dividend and our capital. And then, of course, we showed the
high case of $75 where buybacks were, in fact, higher than the current $10 billion guidance. And we could
buy back at that point in time, it was more than 25% of the company, it's a little bit less based on the
current stock price. So that's exactly how we're thinking about it.
To Neil's question and the macro, it was just 2 years ago today on this earnings call, that Chevron was the
only company to show a 2-year stress test at $30 Brent. And that was a real stress test. And we showed
that we could maintain the dividend, invest in the business for long-term value. We certainly reduced
some short-cycle capital. And yes, we would take on some debt, but we'd have a debt ratio that would still
be very manageable. And in fact, would be not far from where many of our competitors were entering the
COVID crisis.
So as Mike says, we're mindful of the cycles that are in our business, we have to plan and manage for
them. Again, we could have -- we can afford a much bigger buyback program next quarter. We don't --
you know, Jeanine, a net debt ratio under 11% is not what we're targeting. I mean that's just how the
math works. We grew our dividend 6% earlier this year. Our dividend is up nearly 20% since COVID,
while many in the industry cut their dividends during the last couple of years. Our investment -- organic
investment is up more than 30% versus last year. When you include our announced acquisitions, total
investment is up 50%. So clearly, we're investing, as Mike has said, to grow both our traditional and new
energy businesses.
And we paid down debt, and we've been increasing our buyback as we've seen the strength of this upcycle
and the likely duration of it increase, but the cycle will turn, and we'll continue to do buybacks. And so we
want to set the buyback at a rate that we can manage in, not only at our mid-cycle cash flow generation
capability, but even when it goes below that. Again, we're going to -- there's going to be a time where
we're going to be buying back shares, and we'll be doing it on the balance sheet because we want to
relever back closer to that 20% to 25% net debt ratio range that I've talked about.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. Very helpful. Maybe if we just can move back to the assets on the Permian. Permian for
you guys is firing on all cylinders, clearly have a big asset there with huge long-term value. One of the
things that has been talked about a bunch recently is just FT on the gas side and how you kind of see that
evolving. Just wondering how Chevron is looking at that for your long-term plans?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jeanine, we -- I'm glad you talked about long-term plans because we've had a long-term Permian
plan. And interestingly, notwithstanding one of the most volatile 2-year periods we've seen, our production
profile doesn't look that different than it did just a couple of years ago in terms of where we're headed.
And of course, that drives everything from contracting for rigs and completion services to takeaway
capacity for oil and gas liquids and gas. We've got sufficient takeaway capacity for our production through
the middle of this decade.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
And as we look forward, we're working on what it takes beyond that period of time. So we don't flare
in the Permian. And so we've got to be sure we've got gas takeaway or we're not going to produce oil.
And so it's a high priority for our midstream team. But we don't see pinch points anytime soon, and we
continue to be a very attractive shipper for the people that we do business with because we're predictable.
We've got a strong track record of continuing to deliver the growth that we have indicated. We got a
strong balance sheet, and all those things mean that people like to do business with us. So we feel pretty
good about that for the next few years.

We'll take our question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Two questions, please. First on inflation. Pierre, just curious, I mean for your CapEx for the next, say,
2 or 3 years, do you have a percentage you can share? What percent of your CapEx is in pretty much
fixed price contracts, so don't subject much to inflation and what percent is really quite vulnerable to the
inflation? And also, when we're looking at your CapEx for this year, the Bunge JV $600 million investment,
is that included in your original budget or that this will be in addition to your original budget? That's the
first question.
The second question maybe is for Mike, that with the much sharply higher commodity prices, when you
have discussion and negotiation with the NOC, the host government, is there a change in the attitude or
that it become more difficult for you to get better terms? Or that this is happening too quick and so you
haven't really seen any change in the way how you conduct the discussion with your counterpart in the
national companies or the host government?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'll start...
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Pierre, do you want to start on -- yes, go ahead.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, I'll start on the first question. There are several parts to it. So first, the Bunge joint venture,
anything that is an acquisition inorganic is not included in our $15.3 billion budget that we shared back
in December. So I think we cited that, in fact, in that press release that Bunge would be in addition. And
then the other potential inorganic, there was a little bit of inorganic in the first quarter that included an
investment in Carbon Clean, a technology company. REG also will not be included. You won't see REG
though, even in our total capital, our total C&E because it's a company acquisition.
So let me just talk about cost inflation a little bit. We are seeing more cost pressure in the Permian. It's
manageable. But if we go outside the U.S. seeing hardly any or much more modest increases, and none
of that is changing our $15.3 billion CapEx budget that we've talked about. I'll remind everyone that the
Permian is 20% of our capital budget. So it gets a lot of attention. But again, 80% of it is not -- or outside
the U.S. is not seeing much cost pressure at all.
In the Permian, as Mike said, we plan our business. So we have all the equipment and services to execute
our plan. And we've seen a little bit more than we had budgeted, but we can offset some of that with
efficiencies in the Permian and with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. Our focus is turning to 2023 and
securing all the equipment and services that we'll need to execute that plan. But we'll share the details as
we update our annual budget, which we do every December.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
In general, Paul, you can think that we contract 30% to 40% of our total supplies each year. So that every
2 to 3 years on a rotational basis, it can vary, it depends by location. But we don't -- notionally, we are
going to be exposed to some of these higher prices as we move into future years. Again, we've been able
to manage this year very well depending on -- due to how we contracted previously.
Our $15 billion to $17 billion capital guidance, which goes on for 5 years, kind of assumes mid-cycle
conditions. So it has the ability to absorb some of these cost increases that are transient. And so we'll
execute within that. We have Tengiz coming off, which will open up more room in that capital guidance.
And again, we'll share all the details when we release our capital budget in December.
But the bottom line is we're seeing modest increase. As we said, overall, our capital budget had just a
few low single digits of COGS inflation for this year, a little bit more than that in the Permian. It's all very
manageable, and we're working hard to secure contracts for future years activity. Mike?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Paul, your second question was on discussions with host governments on concessions and how that
may be affected by the price environment. I would tell you that right now, we're pretty early into this price
upcycle. And I'm not sure that I can say we've seen a lot of change as people are really adjusting to the
environment we're in. But on the broader issue of concession extensions, look, we've got to find these
opportunities and negotiations that create value for the company and for the host country. And so you
really have to look at it through the lens of both.
We had long histories in both Indonesia and Thailand. I would have liked to extend those concessions that
are rolling off last year and this year, but we couldn't find an outcome that satisfied the host governments
expectations and that would compete for capital within our portfolio, which has got a lot of alternatives.
The flip side of that is Angola, where we last year extended our Block 0 concession from 2030 out to 2050.
And that's a partnership that started more than 60 years ago. And there was a lot of common ground
there on contributing to reliable and cleaner supply for Angola, reducing greenhouse gas emissions there
and finding a way to do that on terms that will attract capital within our portfolio.
So we approach each one of these things, looking for value for our shareholders and to provide a
proposition for other stakeholders that they find acceptable. Sometimes we can achieve that. Other times,
we can't. So more to follow probably in terms of -- if this turns out to be a long upcycle, how that may
change those dynamics. But I think the fundamental approach that we take is unlikely to change.

Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes. If we could maybe talk a little bit about some of the bigger projects, thinking about your answer
earlier, Mike, on some of the macro items and under investment. I know you have some things in the Gulf
of Mexico. You've obviously got an extensive LNG footprint globally. How do you think over the next couple
of years blending in your kind of known deepwater projects and then the possibility of doing something
again on the LNG front?
Michael K. Wirth

Yes. So we've got a nice set of projects under development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Jack/St.
Malo has a multiphase pumping project that will start up this year. Next year, we'll hit the first waterflood
injection on St. Malo and some additional development drilling there. Big Foot, which is on production right
now. We've got ongoing development drilling and water injection soon to follow. Mad Dog 2 is slated for
first oil this year. We've got Anchor, which is expected to have first oil in 2024. Whale also expecting to
have first oil in 2024. We just sanctioned Ballymore, which we'll have first oil in 2025.

in the past is they're not all in the same phase of development at the same time. So I gave you those kind
of in order of when they come on production. But we don't have them just sitting on top of each other.
So a lot of the lessons of maybe the last upcycle were don't take on more than you or your suppliers and
contractors have the capacity to do well in any given period of time, and we're really trying to apply that
here.
So it doesn't get as much attention or interest as we get from the Permian these days or Kazakhstan, but
a really important part of our portfolio, really nice projects and very low carbon energy for the world. I
mean, this is some of the lowest carbon intensity stuff in our portfolio. Our portfolio averages about 28
kilograms of CO2 per BOE. Our Gulf of Mexico averages 6. So it's not only economic, it's low carbon. It's
something that I think that our country is blessed with and should continue to advance leasing in the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
On the other question, LNG. I addressed earlier a little bit of the -- we got a number of options in
the Eastern Mediterranean. We're talking to some people here in the U.S. You may have seen media
reports that we have been talking to people in the Middle East about expansion projects there. So we're
evaluating a number of different opportunities. We'd like to grow our LNG position. The world needs it. But
similar to my response to Paul, it's got to compete for capital.
In our portfolio, Pierre mentioned, we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We've given you a range.
We've stuck within that range. Ever since we started putting that out here, and that would be the intent.
So just because something looks good through the lens of growth and commodity exposure is also got to
compete for capital in a disciplined budget. And so we'll just see which of those, ultimately, if any, kind of
past that screen.

We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Maybe a follow-up on LNG. I mean the last couple of quarters have been impacted by various LNG
volumes offline. I know you've leased on an LNG statement in the second quarter. Any kind of clarity you
can give in terms of how much volume impact that might have? And beyond that, can you give an update
on the other potential volume disruptions across your LNG operations?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So in the first quarter, we had a little bit at Gorgon from some of the things that we had talked about
earlier. So some discovery work that was proactive, not related to an incident, but it was asset integrity
work across all 3 trains. A little bit of that came into the first quarter of this year. Wheatstone has a
turnaround underway right now of one of the 2 trains and also the offshore platform and some common
facilities, which -- that requires both trains to come down when you take the offshore and common
facilities down.
The good news is that part of the turnover is behind us right now. And we're in the process of resuming
production at one of the 2 trains there at Wheatstone and should have first LNG any day now. And
actually, the second train will be early May. So we're nearly through that turnaround. Then we also have a
turnaround in -- at Angola LNG. And so that will be in the second quarter -- late in the second quarter and
that's really what we've got planned for this year. Second quarter takes all the planned turnaround activity
essentially or the majority of it.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Okay. And then maybe a second question on refining. Can you talk about some of the -- I guess, as you
think about the -- some of the headwinds that were maybe felt during the first quarter and relative to

headline margins, whether it's lag on timing effects or secondary products or things like that. Can you talk
about how some of those trends may reverse or shift into the second quarter looking forward? And how
you think about the ability to kind of capture some of that back as we look in through second quarter and
third quarter?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll take a pass, then Pierre might want to add something. Look, we see this in our downstream
business. We're a little bit differently positioned than some of our peers in that. We've got pretty heavy
U.S. West Coast exposure and heavy Asia exposure, but then we're pretty light in the Middle East or
Europe and some of the other basins. So our portfolio is a little concentrated more so than others. And so
-- we're subject to the dynamics in those markets. China has been in a lot of kind of ongoing lockdowns.
California, frankly, has had a little more aggressive COVID policy longer than some other parts of the
world. And so demand has reflected that to a certain degree. And then in a rising crude market, we have
2 effects that tend to roll through our downstream. One is just the way our inventory is valued and so in a
rising market, we tend to see inventory -- negative inventory effects due to the LIFO accounting that we
use. And we also tend to see -- we're long physical and short paper as we try not to take price exposure.
But that paper marks to market until the physical closes.
And so in a rising market, your papers marking negative, the physical obviously, is gaining. And so you
see that paper and then the physical deliveries you close out the paper and you match those up. So in
a rising market, those 2 effects tend to cause negatives. I think in the second quarter of this year, we'll
probably see a lot of that reverse.
Operator
We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
My first question is a quick clarification. You did indicate there was a storm at CPC. I think it came
somewhere late March, but the impact would probably be felt more in 2Q. So help us understand how long
the facilities were down? And how should we model the impact on production because of this particular
storm?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So -- yes, you want to handle that, Pierre? Go ahead.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. That's in our guidance, Manav, that we provided in -- for the second quarter production impacts from
planned turnarounds and downtime. And again, the CPC TCO impact is about 15% or less than 15% of
that total.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. And then the second thing is...
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
And you're right, Manav. It was late March when it came up. So the effect is really in the month of April.

Perfect. At your energy transition day, you had provided certain targets for growing your renewable fuel
franchise, and REG gets you a very long way when it comes to renewable diesel. But another area you
were generally bullish on was sustainable aviation fuel. You had indicated that long term, you believe this
is a big growth market. So can you help us understand, since then and going forward, how does Chevron
plan to build on its sustainable aviation fuel business?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Manav. We -- obviously, aviation demand is going to grow as we go forward. And finding a solution,
it's one of the hardest to decarbonize segments of the economy because you need to have high energy
density for aviation fuels or planes can't carry much in terms of their cargo. So it's an area of focus. In a
traditional refinery, the distillate portion of the barrel, you can move molecules from diesel to kerosene or
jet fuel. And the renewable diesel investments that we're making, there's a certain flexibility that you have
there as well.
And so we will have the ability to produce. In fact, we've already produced some sustainable aviation fuel
at El Segundo. And we'll see more of that coming through some of our renewable diesel facilities. We have
also get negotiations underway with some other companies that have different technologies that wouldn't
necessarily be the same as what we would do in a refinery. And so we're looking at alternate pathways,
feedstock partnerships and pathways.
This is all going to take time to come together. Quality control is really important in aviation fuels,
reliability of supply is really important. And as we introduce new feedstocks, new technology pathways,
you have to be really diligent in ensuring that the fuel that you ultimately produce and sell is going to
perform in the engines that it's going to be consumed into.
The last thing I'll say is none of this stuff is inexpensive. And sustainable aviation fuel today is not
competitive with traditional aviation fuel from a cost standpoint. There has been some talk in Washington
about various policy incentives that could be put into place to encourage more sustainable aviation fuel.
There's a letter that was published by a whole host of people, airlines and others just in the last week or
so calling for action. And I think to see this scale, we got to keep working on technology in feedstocks but
it's likely that some sort of policy incentives will be part of the equation in order to see more capital drawn
into sustainable aviation fuel.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Mike, I know you've plugged to death, I guess, the questions around CPC, Kazakhstan and so on. I wonder
if I could just ask a slightly different question around what's happening to realizations, insurance rates,
whether that could be a durable discount on the value of the barrel coming out of Tengiz and over what
timeline? So I don't know if you can offer any color there, but obviously, it's something we noticed going
on in the market.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So pre-invasion, CPC discounts were maybe $1 or so to dated Brent. Post-invasion, the trading rate
insurance kind of been $4 to $10 net prices at a pricing point called Augusta, which includes insurance and
freight. So yes, there's been a move. It's, call it, $7 or $8 today, probably. Now absolute price obviously
has moved up a lot more than that. But there's a little bit that you could argue as being left on the table.
I think a lot of it, Doug, depends on how things are resolved in Ukraine and what the longer-term posture
is relative to sanctions, the perceived risk of lifting at Novvi resis and how that translates into demand
from customers and the expectations from shipowners and whether it's freight rates, insurance, et cetera,
are people willing to send ships back in there the way they historically have or not.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
So it's a hypothetical. I think that I can't really speculate on how that settles out. But I think it's a function
of how this whole situation is resolved and what kind of risks people perceive on the other side of the
conflict resolution.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
I know it's a tough one to ask in the relatively early stages of this whole thing. So thanks, Mike, for having
a go. I guess my follow-up, and I think it might have been Neil mentioned it earlier, but your credentials
on M&A are obviously probably the best in the industry now, Mike, and you've led that. So -- and well
earned. But your balance sheet into a point as you thought it's kind of almost back to 2013, '14 levels,
if you take -- project out a year or so. And there's strategic opportunities as this whole thing evolves,
particularly perhaps in U.S. gas, LNG and so on.
So I wonder if I could ask the M&A question a little differently as well, which is when you look at your
business today and how you'd have invested and how you've transitioned through Noble and so on, is
there any way you would identify, for one of a better expression, a strategic want or a strategic hole that
you would like to fill? And what would that look like?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Doug, I appreciate the comments about our M&A track record and our financial strength. Those are
2 things that we've worked hard to establish. I'll tell you, we like our portfolio. We've provided, again, I
think in this year's Investor Day, a 10-year outlook that says how much resource have we captured and
could conceivably flow into production, not that, that's a production to forecast, but it's really a look at
resource depth.
We've talked a little bit today about gas. We're a little oilier than most. And so over time, can we
increase some of our gas exposure would be one question. We like petrochemicals. We like CPChem a
lot. We've got a big chemicals business embedded in Korea, in GS Caltex. The growth prospects in the
petrochemicals business continue to look attractive. And then we've been active in new energies. And so
the renewable fuels business that we talked about, some other things that we're looking at in that space
as well.
And so look, we're trying to leverage our strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world.
And I think that drives the way we think about our portfolio today and tomorrow. And a number of things
I've mentioned there, right, are lower carbon contributions to economic growth and prosperity. So that
would be how we think about it. But I don't want to leave the impression that we're off to the races to
do anything tomorrow because we like our portfolio as it sits today and don't feel like there's a hole that
has to be filled in the short term. So we really can take a long-term look. We can be patient. We can be
selective if we decide to do anything.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
First, I just wanted to clarify on the LNG maintenance. What is the cadence of maintenance across your
assets going forward in future years? You've obviously had a period of very concentrated maintenance
events. Is it 1 train a year? Or how do we think about that on a normalized basis? And then my follow-
up is, just given the changing energy dynamics, I wonder if your discussions with governments, both
domestically and abroad, if the discussions and the sentiment has changed at all in terms of the ability
to invest in places? And if that's in any way starting to reshape the way you look at your investment
opportunities?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
Okay. LNG turnarounds were typically at a 4-year turnaround cycle. So what that means is that Gorgon
with 3 trains, you'll have 3 out of the 4 years, you'll have 1 turnaround. At Wheatstone with 2 trains, 2
out of every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. And at Angola LNG, where we've got a single train, 1 out of
every 4 years, you'll see a turnaround. On government discussions, it's just early, Jason, to say. I don't
think anybody's really fully adapted or no one knows what the environment is likely to look like a year
from now, 2 years from now, 5 years from now. So I think that's one that is a work-in-progress.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
The first one is just thinking about the capital framework again. And through the various presentations in
recent years, the management team has been very consistent in talking about improving book returns.
I think, Pierre, you've been quite emphatic around stating that the market doesn't reward higher capital
spending, given, I guess, the industry's track record. I understand the CapEx budget in the range was only
put out there a short while ago, but obviously, a lot has changed in recent months.
So the market clearly wants more energy. You are generating record amounts of cash, the buybacks are
already at the top end of the range, shares are close to all-time highs. Do you think the market is sending
signals yet that would support a capital budget increase beyond what you're doing in the Permian maybe
through more exploration or otherwise? That's my first question.
And the second question is on TCO and the growth projects there. Has anything that's happened in the
last couple of months impacted your thinking around the timeline to deliver those growth projects going
forward?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll -- Biraj, I'll take the second one, and then Pierre has been spending a lot of time with investors,
and I'll let him talk to you about whether the market is signaling we ought to change our capital spend.
On TCO, we just had a pretty extensive update on the project here. Week before last, we made good
progress through the winter. We're close to having our annual cost and schedule update done. But the
high-level message on that is we look pretty good on budget still. We look good on the schedule for the
future growth project, which is slated up -- slated to start up in the first half of '24. A little bit of pressure
on WPMP, which I believe our last update on that was second half '23 -- late '23. So cost and schedule
despite the challenges of COVID and the other kind of regional uncertainties still holding well. The project
team there is doing an excellent job.
So I think Jay will be on the second quarter call and can give you a more complete run down on things.
We will have all these costs and schedule reviews completed, but nothing there that signals a significant
change.
Now Pierre, maybe you can talk about signals from the market on capital.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We don't intend to change our capital guidance. The objective is to sustain and grow the enterprise at
the lowest capital level. We're much more capital-efficient than we were just a few years ago, let alone
a decade ago. We showed and Mike just referred to, that we can sustain and grow our traditional energy
business at very reasonable rates and the rates that we don't need to grow faster, and we don't get paid
for that. There's no time in the -- our history where the market has valued growth. I mean that's why we
emphasize return on capital employed because we are income-oriented, dividend-paying returns type of
investment.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2022 EARNINGS CALL | APR 29, 2022
And then, of course, we're growing new energies, and we have 2 big transactions are expected to close
soon and more on the way. So if we're able to sustain and grow this enterprise, traditional energy at
rates that are in line with industry growth rates, new energy faster. And we can do that at lower -- at less
capital, that leaves more cash flow for shareholders.
And so what you're seeing, and back to Jeanine's question and other questions, we generate -- at
whatever the oil price you assume, we generate more free cash flow than we ever have in the past. And
that means we're able to grow the dividend at very competitive rates and have this buyback that we can
maintain across the cycle.
So we are very sensitive to doing our part. And as we said, we're growing energy supply in the U.S., in the
Permian and other locations. At the same time, the objective for a capital-intensive commodity business is
to do it in the most capital-efficient way. The more capital efficient we are, the more capital gets returned
to shareholders.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jen. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm
Roderick Green, GM of Investor Relations. Our Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber,
are on the call with me. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's
website.
Before we begin, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Roderick.
After the challenges of 2020, we began last year clear-eyed about the economic realities we faced and
at the same time optimistic about an eventual recovery. By the end of 2021, we had one of our most
successful years ever with return on capital employed approaching 10%, our highest since 2014; the
successful integration of Noble Energy, while more than doubling initial synergy estimates; and record free
cash flow, 25% greater than our previous high.
2021 was also the year when Chevron accelerated our efforts to advance a lower carbon future by forming
Chevron New Energies, an organization that aims to grow businesses in hydrogen, carbon capture and
offsets; introducing a 2050 net zero aspiration for upstream scope 1 and 2 emissions and establishing a
portfolio carbon intensity target that includes scope 3 emissions and more than tripling our planned lower
carbon investments.
Chevron is an even better company today than we were just a few years ago. We're showing it through
our actions and our performance, which we expect to drive higher returns and lower carbon. And we
intend to keep getting better.
Our record free cash flow enabled us to strongly address all 4 of our financial priorities in 2021: a higher
dividend for the 34th consecutive year; a disciplined capital program, well below budget; significant debt
paydown with a year-end net debt ratio comfortably below 20% and another year of share buybacks, our
14th out of the past 18 years.
I expect 2022 will be even better for cash returns to shareholders with another dividend increase
announced this week and first quarter buybacks projected at the top of our guidance range. We're
optimistic about the future, focused on continuing to reward our shareholders while investing to grow our
businesses and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
We made the most of this challenging period, transforming Chevron through a well-timed acquisition
and an enterprise-wide restructuring into a leaner and more productive company. In just 2 years, CapEx
was reduced by almost half from Chevron and Noble's pre-COVID total. And operating expenses for the
combined company in 2021 were lower than for Chevron on a stand-alone basis in 2019.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
The Noble acquisition and increasing capital efficiency enabled us to maintain a 5-year reserve
replacement ratio above 100%. And 2021 was very consistent with that longer-term performance, driven
primarily by additions in the Permian, Gulf of Mexico and Australia and partly offset by lower reserves in
Kazakhstan, mostly due to higher prices and their negative effect on our share of reserves.
For more on our strong financial performance, over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike.
We reported fourth quarter earnings of $5.1 billion or $2.63 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.9
billion or $2.56 per share. The quarter's results included 3 special items: asset sale gains of $520 million,
primarily on sales of mature conventional assets in the U.S.; losses on the early retirement of debt of
$260 million, which will result in significant future interest cost savings and pension settlement costs of
$82 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.
Full year earnings were over $15 billion, the highest since 2014. Compared with 3Q, adjusted 4Q earnings
were down $770 million. Adjusted upstream earnings were flat, with higher realizations offset primarily by
negative LNG trading timing effects and higher DD&A. DD&A increased on catch-up depreciation for our
interest in North West Shelf, which no longer meets asset held-for-sale criteria and impairments of certain
late in life assets triggered by updated abandonment estimates. Other items include additional taxes and
royalties related to higher prices under certain international contracts.
Adjusted downstream earnings were down with lower chemicals margins and volumes at CPChem and
GS Caltex, in addition to year-end inventory charges. The All Other segment declined due to tax charges.
Across all segments, operating expenses increased in part due to higher accruals for employee bonuses
and stock-based compensation.
Adjusted earnings increased over $15 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased
realizations in upstream as well as improved refining and chemicals margins. Costs were up primarily
on the acquisition of Noble Energy that closed in 4Q 2020, higher fuel costs and an unfavorable swing in
accruals for employee benefits.
2022 production is expected to be flat to down 3% due to expiration of contracts in Indonesia and
Thailand. These contracts are not being extended as we were unable to do so on terms competitive with
our alternatives. Excluding contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, we expect a 2% to 5% increase in
production led by the Permian and lower turnaround activity in TCO and Australia. We reaffirm our prior
long-term guidance of a 3% production CAGR through 2025, and we'll share more about our long-term
outlook at our upcoming Investor Day.
I'll call out a few items on Slide 11. Full year guidance for the All Other segment excludes special items
such as pension settlement costs. The All Other segment can vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Affiliate dividends are expected to be between $2 billion and $3 billion, depending primarily on commodity
prices and margins. We do not expect any additional lending or loan repayments this year at TCO. Finally,
asset sale proceeds are expected to be in line with historical averages.
We've updated our price sensitivities to include natural gas. Also, our guidance for both earnings and
cash flow sensitivities is now the same as we're likely to consume the remainder of our NOLs and other
favorable tax attributes if prices remain higher. Finally, we did not receive our federal income tax refund
last quarter and expect it later this year.
Back to Mike.

I believe 2021 was a pivotal year for Chevron, where we got better in so many ways. And we look forward
to 2022 and beyond confident in our strategy and capabilities that aim to deliver higher returns and lower
carbon. We'll share more during our Investor Day on March 1.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
The first question I had was more of a housekeeping item for you, Pierre, which is, in the quarter, it looked
like LNG timing effects had a meaningful drag here. Recognize there was a lot of volatility, particularly
towards the end of the month with TTF and JKM, but maybe you can break it down in layman's terms for
us. What does that really mean and what happened in the quarter?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Neil. About half of the timing effects in the quarter, and first, we're showing a swing between
3Q and 4Q. We had a gain in third quarter and a negative variance, a negative absolute amount and
negative swing in fourth quarter. About half of the effects in the quarter were due to a negative inventory
charge. So we had 2 cargoes on the water at year-end. They get valued into inventory at average annual
prices, which were well below the purchase price because as you said, Neil, prices, this was a rising price
environment and prices rose in the end of the quarter.
So that will reverse itself next year when those are or this year when they're sold at the higher prices that
they were purchased at. And then the balance of the timing effects are in paper mark-to-market effects.
And as you know, the paper, which is tied to physical cargoes, gets marked to market, whereas the
physical cargoes are not. And so that creates a timing effect, which unwinds when the physical cargoes
are delivered.
We ended the year with a positive mark-to-market, but not as positive as what we had at the end of the
third quarter. We added some JKM shorts during the quarter to balance our portfolio. We're still net long
JKM so any effects going forward will depend on the direction of future prices. And all this activity is really
just geared towards managing our overall price exposure between our sales agreements and our supplies,
which are a mix of both Brent and JKM prices.
And just to put a fine point on the comment you made, these positions are not very large. But when we
have natural gas LNG price movements that have gone from $10 to $20 to $30 an Mcf, it's causing larger
timing effects than you would normally see.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Yes. That makes a lot of sense, Pierre. And then the follow-up for you is just on cash flow. Again, relative
to consensus, it was softer. It does seem like there's some onetimers in there, maybe something around
the timing of tax refunds and then where Angola shows up, but there's still a gap in there. So can you just
talk about how you bridge to Street numbers in your mind and anything we need to carry forward as we
think about next year?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, I'll cover the 2 points you made. And I mentioned that we did not receive the IRS tax refund that
we expected in fourth quarter. We expect it sometime this year. We did receive a TCO dividend. There's a
15% withholding tax that comes off of the dividend. And we did receive the Angola LNG return of capital.
It actually exceeded our guidance. By the way, the TCO dividend was at the high end of our guidance
range. And the return of capital from Angola was above our guidance. But again, it shows up in cash from
investing and not cash from ops because it's a return of capital.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
If you look beyond that, we do have, and as I referred to in our prepared remarks, we have certain
contracts internationally that have additional taxes and royalties that kick in essentially when oil and
LNG prices are higher. And we don't share specifics on our contracts. But as we talked about, we had
extraordinarily high LNG pricing of $30 and then we also had oil prices that increased during the year.
And then the last thing I'd say is, we provided guidance on the third quarter call on our expected increase
in earnings from LNG spot cargoes. And we gave that guidance in part because LNG prices increased
significantly. And we said we expected to have fewer cargoes because our long-term contract takes were
going to be higher during the winter from our primarily Japanese customers. We didn't produce as much
out of Australia, so we had fewer LNG spot cargoes. And again, that was an opportunity missed and that
resulted in lower earnings and cash flow.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Neil, it's Mike. The one other thing that you talked about, what should you bear in mind going forward. As
we've been in this fairly depressed commodity price environment, we've built up net operating losses in
our business. And as we've returned to profitability, those have now been utilized and offset against taxes
payable. As we work our way through those and in a strong price environment that could happen sooner
rather than later, we'll be in a net taxable position that's quite different than what we were before as well.
And so I think that's another point that may not be as evident in the quarter. But as you go forward, it's
kind of a good news, bad news thing, I suppose. We're going to be more profitable, but it also means now
we're going to have higher taxes payable.
Operator
Our next question comes from Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
My first question is on the 2022 production outlook. Obviously, you had an extremely strong Permian
production in the fourth quarter. It's about 70,000 barrels a day or 80,000 barrels a day, I'm sorry, above
the full year average, and you're guiding to 80,000 barrels a day of new production in '22 over '21. So it
seems like you can just get there from the Permian alone. But just curious, are there other moving pieces
that we should be thinking about on the new production element of the growth for '22 or is there some
conservatism there? Any thoughts would be helpful.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Phil, fourth quarter Permian does look strong. And one thing that we do see from time to time is
with our non-operated joint venture position, sometimes the way production gets reported in by partners
can result in a little bit of lumpiness in those numbers. But broadly speaking, the Permian is healthy and
getting better. I think 2022 Permian production will be a little bit better than we showed at our Investor
Day last March. And roughly speaking, up around maybe 10% compared to full year average in 2021.
And that is the largest piece of what we would anticipate in terms of production growth next year. There
is some growth in base and other primarily. As Pierre said in his comments, we've got lower planned
turnaround activity at TCO and we expect some more uptime at Gorgon. And then that's offset by a few
asset sales that we would anticipate. So those are the significant moving pieces in production for 2022.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Great. That's very helpful. And Mike, I know you'll get in a lot more detail in March at the Analyst
Day and looking forward to that. But just kind of looking back pre-COVID at prior analyst days, your
framework was $60 Brent that you're using to balance CapEx and distributions in a fairly evenly balanced
framework. Obviously, oil is $90 now and maybe you don't want to give a guidance at those types of
levels. But I am curious how you're thinking about what is the right way to look at the cash balancing

framework? What price would you think is reasonable these days, as I know you like to manage the
business through the cycle, not based on spot prices.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. We will talk about that more in March, Phil. But our longer-term view on the pricing environment
hasn't changed a lot. There's a lot of resource out there that can be produced economically at prices lower
than what we see today. And our breakeven reflects that. And so we are in a period of time here where
cash flow is strong. As we mentioned in our comments, the last 2 quarters have been the best 2 quarters
the company has ever seen. And last year was 25% higher than the best year in our history.
So we increased the dividend. Debt came down significantly. And we've guided to the high end of our
share repurchase range. If we continue to see an environment like this, the balance sheet doesn't need
to be a lot stronger than it is today. And we've already increased the dividend and we're going to be
disciplined on capital. And so that really leaves one lever left.
And I think over time, you should expect us to be consistent with our history, which is returning cash
through share repurchases. And at least in an environment like this, we've got ample cash to do that and
sustain that well into any kind of a correction that we eventually will see.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Our first question is on TCO. I guess now that you're through much of the winter campaign, is there any
update on how FGP-WPMP and how those are tracking on cost and schedule maybe given your COVID
protocols and efficiencies? And if you have any color on impact related to the recent geopolitical unrest,
that would also be very helpful.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure, Jeanine. Fourth quarter was really good execution on field productivity. We made terrific progress
and that's carried forward as we began the year. We did have some impact during the unrest that occurred
in Kazakhstan, but for about a week is the amount of time that it really cost us in the field there. We've
remobilized everyone now and are back at full strength in terms of field activity. And we've got a highly
vaccinated workforce, more than 90%, one of the highest rates of vaccination anywhere in our system in
the world.
And while we have seen Omicron cases appear in the workforce there, at this point, it's at a level that's
very well managed and is not having any impact on field construction and activity. So we are continuing to
make good progress. We have not made any change to our cost or schedule guidance and are overall at
about 89% project progress and 82% construction progress at this point. So things have been managed
really well on the ground by our team during a pretty challenging month of January.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. Good to hear. Our follow-up question or second question, maybe following up on Phil's
question on the Permian. You guys had a really strong quarter, at least also compared to our expectations.
You mentioned that 2022 production is a little better than where you thought it was going to be from your
March Analyst Day forecast. So just can you clarify, have you accelerated activity there or is it really just
all based on better efficiencies? And I guess given its importance to corporate growth in the medium term,
are you taking any steps related to supplies or labor or equipment in anticipation of some tightening in the
service market over the next couple of years?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So let me speak first to activity. And then I'm going to let Pierre, who's now in charge of our supply
chain organization, by the way, speak to any signs of inflation and how we're managing that. Activity in
the Permian is really increasing aligned with the guidance that we've issued previously and spending this
year up from $2 billion to $3 billion. Wells put on production, a little bit over 200 we anticipate this year,
which is up about 50% versus 2021. And we'll share an update on all of these things when we see you in
March.
So I would say this is really very well aligned with what we've already guided to and indicated and reflects
the ongoing efficiencies that we continue to see in the field and just the quality of this asset, which
endures as we go through cycles like the one we just went through. It's really quite nice to have an asset
in your portfolio that is this large, that's this flexible when it comes to capital and that we can demobilize,
remobilize, not that we would intend to do this frequently, but when conditions call for it, we've been able
to exercise that flexibility here over the last couple of years. So strong progress there and I'll let Pierre
comment on input costs.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Jeanine, we continue to manage our costs, we think, very well in the Permian and across our portfolio.
Our capital budget, which we announced in December, expected some COGS increase, modest in the
low single digits. And we might be seeing a little bit more than that in the Permian, it's very manageable
and we think we can offset with efficiencies. So as we've talked about, although rates are up, they're still
below where they were pre-COVID on rigs. Capacity in the industry for specific oil and gas equipment and
services is still below pre-COVID levels.
So whereas we are exposed to labor and steel and certain other elements, cost elements that are tied to
the broad-based economy, oil and gas-specific equipment services are still well under control. And our
ability to contract well, be a very good partner to work with, all gives us confidence that the little bit of
cost pressure we're seeing is very manageable within the range of what we expected, and we intend to
deliver our capital program in line with our budget.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
So Pierre, I think your explanation about the dividend from TCO being a return of capital, I think that
probably explains why the Street's cash flow numbers were too high. But my question is really about the
go-forward portfolio leverage. So you obviously lose Indonesia, you lose Thailand, which I guess was gas.
But you've got the Permian driving growth on a lighter recent history of PSC capital from a cost curve
standpoint. So my question is, when I think about portfolio oil leverage for the go-forward outlook, how
does that compare to the legacy portfolio given all those changes?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Our guidance on, let me start by saying we've always been the most levered among the integrated energy
companies. That's a function of the portfolio we've created over a long time, which tends to be upstream-
weighted. And within upstream, we tend to be oil-weighted. And again, a big portion of our LNG is sold
under oil prices.
So whereas we were viewed as a defensive stock during some of the challenging times in 2020 and last
year because of how we managed the balance sheet and how we were able to flex our capital program
and manage our costs, we really are more of an oil play and we're much more levered on the upside. And
we've shown that in last Investor Day, and we'll show that again in the upcoming Investor Day.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
In terms of our sensitivity, I mean, it's still around the same when you factor it all in. I mean, Indonesia
was working its way to be a fairly modest portion of the portfolio. You are right over time with both Tengiz
and the Permian. That increases our weighting in some ways. But the guidance that we provided of $400
million of earnings and cash flow benefit from a dollar change in prices still holds.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Okay. My follow-up, if I may, is to go back to your one-off comments, the DD&A and the, I guess, the
timing effects. And so I'm asking the question for a little clarity. On the DD&A, it looks like there was
some catch-up. How much was that because you didn't strip it out? I'm curious why you didn't strip it out.
And then just real quick on the LNG, was there a shift in contract versus spot volume exposure that also
impacted the quarter? And then that's it for me.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Doug. First, just on your first question, so the return of capital was Angola LNG. TCO was the dividend
withholding tax. But you're right that part of that does not show up in cash from ops. In terms of DD&A,
about half is due to the catch-up at North West Shelf. So we designated that asset as held for sale about
18 months ago. So you're capturing 18 months of depreciation all in the fourth quarter.
We don't call that special item because obviously it would have been in our underlying results if it had
been held for use during that time. And the other half are impairments that are tied to increases in
abandonment estimates for late in life assets. So because these estimates, which is part of our regular
updating process, because these assets are very late in life, they don't have the production, remaining
production life or time to recover those additional abandonment estimates and therefore, that results in an
impairment. So about half is the catch-up and then half, and those are both, I would call them onetime in
nature.
And in terms of the LNG, yes, there was a shift in fourth quarter to more contractless spot. We guided to
that on the third quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, it was even more so. So in the winter months, our
Northern Hemisphere customers tend to increase their takes under the long-term contracts. And then we
didn't produce as reliably in the fourth quarter, so we had fewer spot cargoes. So what you're seeing, we
did not benefit as much with the run-up in spot prices as we had guided to in the third quarter, and our
weighting was more oil contract-related. Now those contracts are doing very well. Spot market goes up
and down. But you'll see more exposure as we go forward.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Pierre, just I guess the point was the headline miss wasn't as bad as it looks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So the first one I wanted to ask on is just CapEx. I think it's notable that you all came in for last year
below the bottom end of your CapEx guide. And I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more
about some of the drivers of that CapEx beat. And then, Pierre, you mentioned before, I think, that you're
seeing or assumed a few percentage points of inflation in the Permian. I was wondering if you could
just broaden that out and talk about the inflationary trends you're seeing across the global portfolio and
opportunities to potentially offset that as you think about 2022 spending levels.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
So yes, sorry, the low single digits was really meant to be across the portfolio. And that's factored into
our $15.3 billion capital program. But obviously, if you look offshore, those rig rates have stayed flat to
down. And we do contract where we lock in rates for some services. We have price caps on some services.
There's lots of ways that we work to mitigate our exposure to COGS.
So I would view it as low single digits overall. Permian, perhaps a little bit higher, not nearly as high as
numbers that I'm hearing from some others. We don't see anything in our cost that would be double digits
at all. So a little bit, very modest, a percent or 2 higher than what we had planned for and again, very
manageable by offsetting with efficiencies.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
And on 2021, Devin, there's nothing noteworthy in the profile of CapEx and what it was that drove the
ultimate outcome, which was a little below what we had guided to. There's a lot of inertia in some of these
things. And as we pulled the handbrake pretty hard in 2020, we throttled a lot of things down. And as
we start to bottom out and turn that back around a little bit as we will in 2022, this system just needs to
adjust to that. And so I wouldn't call out anything there that's unique or especially noteworthy.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We have said, still, about half of the underspend is due to project deferrals like at Tengiz due to COVID
and other impacts and about half is capital, greater capital efficiency and other cost savings.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, I wanted to ask on Australia LNG and Gorgon specifically. I
was wondering if you could talk in a bit more detail around some of the recent downtime there? What
happened and then what steps are being taken to ensure better uptime here in 2022?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll take that, Devin. Look, it's a point of frustration, no doubt. During normal rounds, we had an
operator that spotted evidence that we had the risk of an operating issue at one of the units in the
dehydration train. Nothing that was catastrophic or alarming but a sharp-eyed operator picked up
evidence. So something that as we investigated further, we felt it was prudent to take a quick pit stop
to address this. And so that's been completed at 2 of the 3 trains, and they're all same design. So these
things tend to show up across all 3 trains.
The third train is undergoing that pit stop right now and is also addressing a problem with one of the
compressors that was identified, and this was an opportune time to make a couple of changes with
that in order to reduce risk going forward. So we expect to operate reliably. We've done our first major
turnaround on all 3 trains now. Those are behind us at Gorgon. We do not have any planned turnarounds
in 2022. And as we complete this last pit stop that's underway, our expectation is that we're going to have
strong operational performance this year and see more production out of Gorgon than we did in '21.
Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Sankey from Sankey Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Guys, on your guidance that volumes will fall this year, would you characterize that as you using a
conservative oil price assumption and being determined not to raise CapEx or were there other issues
around the concessions particularly? And as a follow-up, could you accelerate the Permian if you wanted to

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
or can you talk about inflationary pressures that you might be seeing in the Permian as a matter of labor,
steel, et cetera, et cetera?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Yes. On production guidance, Paul, I would hope this isn't big news to people. I mean, we've long
been public about the fact that we couldn't extend the concessions in Indonesia and Thailand on terms
that would compete with other opportunities within our portfolio. And so this has been out in the public
domain for quite some time. And so when you pull those out, we're at 2% to 5% and Pierre reiterated the
compound annual growth of 3% out through 2025. And so this is very consistent with the guidance and
the messaging that we've been trying to communicate for quite some time.
On the question of, could you accelerate the Permian. In theory, the answer to that 5 years ago was yes.
The answer to that today is yes. We've been very focused on execution efficiency and returns. And as I
said, we laid out in March of last year a profile that showed strong production growth, long plateau, strong
returns and capital efficiency. We'll update that again here in the new year at March.
But this is an asset that just continues to look as good as we've portrayed it to you, and we're not going
to get out ahead of ourselves chasing anything as we bring activity back up from $2 billion last year to
$3 billion. That's a 50% increase in capital spend. I mentioned that we're going to see a 50% increase in
wells put on production in '22 versus '21. That is a meaningful step-up in activity, and we want to execute
that well. And so I don't think we're going to be tempted by the price of the day to put that at risk by
doing more. And I think Pierre already addressed inflation. I don't know, Pierre, if there's anything else
you'd like to say on either of those topics.

No. Thanks, Paul.

Our next question comes from Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
My quick question is, your U.S. downstream results were down about $400 million quarter-over-quarter
and we expected about $200 million of that to be chemicals headwind. But we also somewhere saw what
peers are doing is that refining was able to jump up and make up for it. In this case, it looks like both
went down a little. And if you could help us understand, was there maintenance in the refining system,
what went on in U.S. refining because of which refining was also down quarter-over-quarter?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Manav, there were a number of items that we referred to, including year-end inventory effects. But the
higher employee benefit costs really crosses all segments that would include U.S. downstream. So we had
a very strong year. We expect higher employee bonuses and we accrued for that. And our stock ran up
in the fourth quarter and has continued actually in the first quarter. And we have to do accrual for stock-
based compensation that's tied to both the absolute stock price movement and the relative stock price
movement because of how some of our incentive programs work. So that's in the segment, and I think
that helps explain part of your question.

And a quick follow-up is, you have a global footprint. Help us understand within your entire system
how you're tracking refined product demand, gasoline, diesel, jet, asphalt, anything you could help us
understand where we are versus before the pandemic started.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Manav, I think a lot of the data you see in the public domain is pretty good. We've got gasoline
demand globally up higher than it was pre-pandemic, diesel at and perhaps slightly above, jet fuel
continues to lag. The specific numbers can vary a little bit region by region. But broadly speaking, that's
where we are. The ground transport fuels are at or above pre-COVID levels. Aviation is not and we still
have an economic recovery underway.
And we still have a lot of people working from home. We have people that aren't traveling for business
and not taking international flights. And so even with the robust demand recovery that we've seen, there
is still another leg to the demand improvement that is likely to occur here in 2022. And so I think the
demand outlook is solid. And the issues, frankly, have been a little bit more on the supply side than the
demand side.
Operator
Next question comes from Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
So I have 2 questions, please. If we're looking at your, I think, well-spoken slogan, lower carbon and
higher return, the idea that Permian definitely is going to contribute to the higher return. Outside Permian,
can you help us there to maybe bridge the gap over there to indicate what are the self-help that you guys
will drive so that we could see a better return over the next perhaps 1 or 2 years?
And the second question is, I want to go back into the Australia LNG. As you indicated, I think that's been
a source of frustration to management as well as to many people. And seems like every, I mean, the train
has only been on stream since 2016, 2015. And so it's really not that old, but we have all this kind of tiny
little problem from different units coming up. And each one, every time that they did since they're all,
everyone there has problem, all the 3 train have problem because they're all under the same design or
same manufacturer. So have you guys go into and do a thorough review on all the units and trying to see
whether that has other potential time bomb that we need to face?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Paul, let me make a quick comment on the return drivers, and I might ask Pierre to build on it and
then I'll come back to LNG. Look, on returns, yes, Permian is highly accretive to returns because we get
very, very strong returns out of the Permian, it's short cycle, and we're putting a fair amount of capital
into it. We are reducing costs across our business. And as I indicated, we're running Chevron and Noble
together today for costs that are lower than Chevron was stand-alone in 2019. So that is a significant
driver of improved returns.
We're working across the value chain to capture more margin. That's both in the downstream and in
the upstream, a lot of self-help initiatives in the downstream. And so there are, rather than think about
pointing to assets, I would talk to you about the way we work and finding ways to improve efficiency and
productivity across all of our operations is what is driving the improvement. And it's really rolling up your
sleeves and doing this the old-fashioned way. And it's a lot of little things that you stay very focused on.
Pierre, I don't know if you want to add anything else on drivers of return improvement.

We'll share more at the upcoming Investor Day, and we've showed it the last couple of investor
days, right? What Mike talked about, it's cost and margin. We obviously doubled Noble synergies. We
transformed the whole enterprise and reduced costs, working across the value chain and optimizing.
As Mike said and Mark Nelson, the downstream has showed some ambitious self-help. And then capital
efficiency, both where we're putting new capital and higher returns across the portfolio and of course, as
lower return prior capital depreciates off. So we'll update you and everyone at our next Investor Day, but
that's the playbook that we've been using and we'll continue to use going forward.
Michael K. Wirth

Paul, to your question about Gorgon, you're right, it's not an old facility. And you're right, it has had more
than its share of teething pains as we've been here in the first few years of operation. We have people all
over this. I mentioned earlier that it was a sharp-eyed operator on routine rounds that spotted something
that we've addressed. And that has averted the possibility of a more serious outage there.
And we continue to do so. We don't have, the phrase you used, I won't repeat, but we don't have a big
problem that's waiting to materialize that we've identified. And we have had strong teams of people from
our upstream organization. We've brought people in from our downstream organization that have a lot of
experience in these process facilities to work on reliability and mechanical integrity and address any of the
things that frankly continue, the things we've been fixing are things that reflect problems that the seeds
were sown during the design and construction at a time when the industry was under a lot of pressure.
And we've talked a lot about how we need to do better and our commitment to improve major capital
project performance going forward.

Our next question comes from Ryan Todd from Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
A question on the Gulf of Mexico. First of all, any update on the progress of potential deepwater
developments in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including Anchor, which feels now like it was sanctioned what
seems like a lifetime ago. And the court just canceled the result of a recent leasehold sale in the Gulf
of Mexico. Maybe comment on whether you see any potential for incremental headwinds there on the
regulatory front that could impact things in the future.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So a quick update on Anchor. We expect first oil in 2024, and that holds. The hull assembly is
complete and commissioning is underway in Korea. We've begun drilling the first development well with a
ship called the Deepwater Conqueror. It's a project that's got an attractive development cost. And that's
even when you include some costs that are really onetime costs related to new technologies. Similarly, the
Whale project, where we're not the operator, is targeted for first oil in 2024 and good progress there. And
finally, Mad Dog 2, where we're also in a non-op position, is expected to have first oil this year.
So a number of projects that are making good progress and an important part of our portfolio. Lease Sale
257, which was in the news. Yesterday, we were the apparent high bidder on a large number of blocks
there that we found attractive. We're reviewing this judicial decision right now, and so I can't comment
more about that. We're disappointed because these lease sales have been conducted successfully in the
Gulf of Mexico for decades now and have resulted in us being one of the largest leaseholders out there
with over 240 leases. It's a strong part of our base business. It contributes to energy security in this
country. These are strong contributors to our portfolio and frankly, some of the lowest carbon intensity
barrels that we produce. So we hope this is resolved in a manner that allows continued development and
investment in the United States energy economy.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
All right. And maybe just an overall question on refining. I appreciate some of the comments you made a
few minutes ago, but in general, it feels like global product markets have tightened up quite a bit with the
outlook looking pretty encouraging for 2022. Can you provide some thoughts about how you're thinking
about the setup for refining this year? What looks encouraging and what are some of the potential risks
that you see to the outlook?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, I mentioned earlier the demand recovery, which is underway and which still has another leg
to it. And we have seen margins strengthen across our portfolio as last year concluded. And so I think
those are encouraging signs. Asia still has, I think, some risks. The approach taken by some countries,
notably China, to how they've dealt with the pandemic may lead their economy to some risks if these
variants continue to emerge.
And then, of course, you have some other things in Asia. And again, in China, the situation within the
real estate sector poses an uncertainty, I think, to some of the economic numbers there overall so. But
broadly speaking, I think you're right, Ryan. We're seeing strengthening on the refining side, we're seeing
utilization improve. And the chemical sector has continued to be strong, although it has been moderating
from the highs early last year, still above mid-cycle as it's kind of trending back towards that. And so I
think we're setting up for a stronger year in '22 than we saw in '21 across that sector.
Operator
Our next question comes from Alastair Syme with Citi.
Alastair Roderick Syme
Citigroup Inc., Research Division
I just had one question, and it's a follow-up to the question you made on returns. And I'll just really make
a simple high-level observation that 2021 cash flow of $31 billion ex working capital is almost identical
to what was delivered in 2018 and then almost identical oil price environment. But of course, the payout
ratio has risen considerably over the last 3 years. And my question is really what does the Board think it's
seeing that gives it the confidence to raise that payout ratio so meaningfully?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. It's the capital efficiency is the big driver, Alastair. So you're right. The commodity price environments
in those 2 years are pretty similar. Cash from ops, pretty similar, although there can be some moving parts
in there that are not necessarily just commodity price. But we have capital spend that is significantly down
from that period of time, which means free cash flow is significantly higher. And our belief going forward,
our capital guidance going forward is $15 billion to $17 billion for the next 5 years.
It has come down from $19 billion to $22 billion pre-COVID. So that's a structural downshift. Our
production guidance has not changed. And so what we have is a portfolio that is generating free cash flow
and future cash flows in a much more capital-efficient manner which allows us to return more capital to
shareholders. So that's the simple story.
Operator
Our next question comes from Biraj Borkhataria, RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
It's actually just a follow-up on North West Shelf and that reclassification there. Could you just provide a
bit more color on the rationale for that? Is that a change in your intentions there? And obviously, the last

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
couple of years is not a great time to be selling assets. I'm just wondering if that was a function of you not
getting the valuation you desired or something else.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Biraj, I think what we've said previously, we had an unsolicited offer on North West Shelf going back
a period of time, which led us to an interesting conversation. And we want value. We're not in a position
where we need to sell assets to generate cash. But if an asset works better for somebody else and they
see a different value equation than we do, that's certainly a conversation worth having.
And so over the last period of time, we've been in a conversation like that. It ultimately has not led to
a transaction. And so it's just changed the accounting classification for that asset. It's a good asset,
generate strong cash flow. Obviously, we're in a market today where LNG demand is very high, and
there's a lot of gas in Australia still to run through these plants. And so it's a nice part of our portfolio.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Just to echo that, view it more as accounting-related than anything else. There's a number of criteria
that need to be met for asset held for sale, and there's this one part that it no longer has met. And so
that's why we did the catch-up depreciation.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Okay. That's very clear. And then the second follow-up was on Tengiz. I think you previously mentioned
potential sort of loan repayments back to the parent. Do you have any guidance for 2022 given the
current pricing environment?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Our guidance is no loan repayment, but also no additional loans. The dividend is included in the overall
affiliate dividend. I will make a point, we changed our guidance from focusing on the cash flow line, which
is affiliate income less dividends, and just focus on the true cash part. If you look back to that line, which
again is the difference between income and dividends from our affiliates, it's still about, our income from
affiliates is expected to be about $2 billion higher than the dividends.
But no loan, no loan repayment. We had a little bit of repayment last year. Again, we had our first dividend
in a number of years in December. And in the current price environment, obviously, we expect strong
dividends from Tengiz this year. It's a matter up to their Board. And as the project is completed and comes
on, then the ability to increase dividends further and pay back the loan, and we'll share more on the cash
flow generation capability of Tengiz during our Investor Day.
Operator
Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman from Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
The first one is just on international gas exposure. Even backing out this timing impact, it looked like
the realizations were a bit light. And I thought it would be helpful if maybe you could talk through that
international gas exposure, the different pricing exposures within that, maybe splitting it up between hub-
based, LNG-based, fixed price or however you think about the commodity exposure within that production
bucket.
And the second question, thinking about CapEx, I think your message is loud and clear that this year
you're going to be around that $15 billion and you're going to manage the business to that. But as we look
forward and think about where you could ramp up spend, is that $17 billion high end of the range? Is that

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 28, 2022
where you think the kind of ramp up in spending you could do in your short-cycle basins? Or is there, in
theory, if oil prices stay at elevated levels, can you ramp up in your short-cycle basins even more? And
once again, I'm not thinking about this year, in particular, but in the future, if we're in an environment
where oil prices stay elevated.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Jason, I'll take your first question. So on our LNG portfolio, you can think of that as 80% oil-linked, 20%
JKM. That includes Australia but also West Africa, so Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. If you look to our
international gas though, we have lots of other gas contracts around the world. As you say, some are fixed
price, some are partially oil-related with a lag. And so you won't see necessarily that direct effect.
We have some that are low, for example, in West Africa that go to domestic markets. But if you look
overall for the LNG from those 3 countries, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Australia, 80-20 is pretty good.
Australia now is a little bit higher because we had an additional long-term contract, but the West Africa
LNG is largely spot-related and JKM or TTF price-related.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
And on longer-term CapEx, if I caught your question, Jason. Look, we give this range of $15 billion to $17
billion we've put out there. We're at the low end of the range this year. Now that's a 30% step-up from
where we finished 2021. And as I mentioned earlier, in a place like the Permian, it's a 50% step-up. So it's
not a trivial change, but it's still a very disciplined approach to that business. And we intend to stay within
that range as we've guided.
Can we move around within it? Yes. Can that include additional short cycle? Yes. And as the project in
Kazakhstan winds down, that opens up some capacity within that range to allocate capital to other high-
return investments. And so we've got plenty of levers to pull. But I think the overarching message that
investors should take away is, we're going to stay disciplined on capital. We're not chasing price. We're
improving returns and you can count on us to continue to do that. And we should generate very strong
free cash flow in this environment.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Sorry, just to clarify, I think your guidance was on LNG. I was hoping to get it on the broader international
gas price exposure.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
That's just a mix of contracts, Jason. I'd follow up with Roderick. I mean, I think we show our realization
by country, but we don't have a shorthand on how to characterize because it really is a mix of contracts in
a number of countries outside the U.S.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is
being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation,
Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron’s third quarter earnings conference call. I’m Roderick Green, GM
of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP of Downstream & Chemicals;
and Pierre Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron’s
website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections, and
other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now, I will turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Roderick. We reported third quarter earnings of $6.1 billion, or $3.19 per share, the highest
reported earnings in more than 8 years. Adjusted earnings were $5.7 billion, or $2.96 per share. The
quarter's results included 2 special items, asset sale gains of $200 million and pension settlement costs
of $81 million. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Adjusted ROCE was greater than 13%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to below 19%.
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to deliver on our financial priorities, including the resumption of
share repurchases. Compared to before COVID, operating costs are down, upstream production is up and
we're much more capital efficient.
Cost efficiency and capital efficiency are essential to navigate commodity price cycles, providing resilience
through the low periods and leveraging upside when markets are strong. This has been evident over the
past several quarters, and especially so in the most recent one, as we generated company-record free
cash flow, higher than the strongest quarters in 2008 and '11 when oil prices were well over $100 a barrel.
Adjusted earnings -- adjusted third quarter earnings were up more than $5 billion versus last year,
primarily on higher prices, margins and volumes. Compared with last quarter, adjusted third quarter
earnings were up almost $2.5 billion.
Adjusted upstream earnings increased on higher realizations and positive timing effects, primarily related
to managing LNG portfolio pricing exposure. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily on higher
refining and marketing margins.
The All Other variance was positive due to lower corporate charges and the use of deferred tax assets,
which previously had a valuation allowance. Third quarter oil equivalent production increased 7% year-
over-year due to the Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partly offset by price-related entitlement
effects and asset sales.
I'll now pass it over to Mark.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
Thanks, Pierre. In Downstream & Chemicals, we delivered our best adjusted earnings in more than 4
years. Demand for our product is strong, with recovery of jet fuel sales expected as international travel
gradually returns. And while the improving market environment helps, we're focused on what we can
control: safe and reliable operations, capital and cost efficiency and value chain optimization to drive
higher returns.
Some examples of our self-help actions include using digital tools to improve planning, scheduling and
prioritization of maintenance activity, leveraging data analytics and asset flexibility to increase margins
and adopting new technologies like robotic inspections and maintenance procedures.
During our Investor Day in March, I highlighted that self-help is expected to drive higher returns for
Downstream & Chemicals. We're on track to meet that guidance with benefits already flowing to the
bottom line.
Chemicals performance is also strong as CPChem responds to current market conditions while continuing
to keep a focus on longer-term unit cost reduction. GS Caltex reached 100% design capacity of its mixed-
feed cracker, ahead of schedule and under budget.
The CPChem U.S. Gulf Coast II project continues to advance towards a final investment decision in a
disciplined way that positions the project to earn attractive returns through the cycle. And the Ras Laffan
Project is in FEED, and we continue to evaluate this project.
We believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals. Our investment focus continues to be on the low
end of the supply cost curve, advantaged feedstock, competitive capital and cost structure and strong
project execution.
Since our Energy Transition Spotlight, we closed the acquisition of an equity interest in American Natural
Gas and its network of 60 CNG retail sites with our partner, Mercuria, enabling us to meet customers'
needs beyond California. We're also delivering first gas through our Brightmark partnership, and all CalBio
gas farms are now online.
We sold the first sustainable aviation fuel produced from our El Segundo refinery to Delta Airlines at LAX.
And earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire Neste's Group III base oils business and
its NEXBASE brand. Pending regulatory approval, we anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022.
The acquisition is expected to provide a capital-efficient approach to expand our base oil offerings. And
coupled with Novvi's renewable products, position Chevron to be the supplier of choice to meet customers'
needs now and into the future.
Back to you, Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mark. We recently released an updated Climate Change Resilience Report, which includes: a stress
test of our portfolio under IEA's Net Zero 2050 scenario; a new target called portfolio carbon intensity that
includes Scope 1 and 2 and Scope 3 emissions from the use of our products; and Chevron's net zero 2050
aspiration for upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions. I encourage everyone to read our latest report available
on our website.
Now looking ahead. In the fourth quarter, we expect lower production due to a planned turnaround in
Wheatstone, which was completed last week, and repairs at the Alba gas plant in Equatorial Guinea.
In addition, our participation in the Rokan PSC in Indonesia ended in August. Production from Rokan
averaged 84,000 barrels of oil equivalent year-to-date.
We expect earnings from JKM-related spot sales out of Australia to increase around $50 million from 3
quarter -- from third quarter due to fewer spot cargoes, as our long-term customers increase deliveries
heading into winter. We're also expecting 3 discrete cash items: a return of capital from Angola LNG, TCO's
first dividend in several years and a federal income tax cash refund. There are no P&L impacts from these
items.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
During 4Q, we expect to buy back shares at the high end of our guidance range. Finally, we're lowering
our full year C&E guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion, primarily due to COVID-related project spend
deferrals into next year, lower non-op CapEx in the Permian and continued capital efficiencies.
To wrap up the quarter, we continued to make progress toward our objective of higher returns, lower
carbon. We're more capital and cost efficient, generated record free cash flow and are taking actions
to lower the carbon intensity of our operations and grow lower-carbon businesses. We're executing a
straightforward strategy that's expected to deliver value now and well into the future.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Roderick.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Congrats on the great results. So my first question, Pierre, I think, is for you. I just wanted to ask for a
little bit more detail on the reduction in the capital spending guidance for this year. It sounds like it's a mix
of different factors. Some of it's deferrals next year. Some of it's mix of non-op and efficiency gains. Can
you just bridge the delta a little bit more detail for us? And also talk about whether or not these deferrals
or how these deferrals impact planned 2022 spend?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Devin. We lowered our CapEx guidance to $12 billion to $13 billion. That's from our budget of
$14 billion and from our revised guidance that we had in the second quarter of $13 billion. So in the last
quarter, what's changed? While we continued to see non-op spend in the Permian below our expectations,
we did have some deferred major capital project spending tied to Hurricane Ida and the Delta variant
wave. And then we've seen -- continued to see continued capital efficiency across -- in the Permian and
across the portfolio.
It does not change our CapEx guidance. Our CapEx guidance for next year and through 2025 is $15 billion
to $17 billion. We do expect higher CapEx in the fourth quarter and next year. The low end of that range is
about a 20% increase from the midpoint of our revised guidance.
So these deferrals are very manageable. And again, I would think from the original $14 billion budget,
about half you can think of deferrals and half, I would say, is capital efficiency and cost savings where
we're getting the same results at -- for less capital.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. Makes a lot of sense. And then my follow-up is on cash returns. So very strong free cash flow in the
quarter. Your debt target is now below the bottom end of your target range. It's good to see the increase
in the cadence of the buyback in 4Q.
I guess my question is, what are some of the things you're looking for to further increase that buyback
target back to something closer to the pre-COVID run rate?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
As you said, Devin, our guidance for fourth quarter is at the high end of the range. So that's a $3 billion
annual rate or $750 million in the quarter. And as I said last quarter, and I'll restate now, we'll increase
the buyback range when Chevron's net debt ratio was comfortably below 20%. We ended third quarter
with a net debt ratio a little bit under 19%, down from 21% at the end of the second quarter. So we just
got below 20%, but we're fast approaching a net debt level where we could increase the buyback range
further.
As a reminder, Devin, I know you know this, we intend to main our buyback for multiple years through
the cycle. And so we're positioning our balance sheet below our mid-cycle range, so that will enable us to
continue buybacks even if the cycle turns.

We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Yes, I just want to echo great results here. Pierre, I wanted to take a moment to talk about the global gas
market. You spent a lot of time looking at this over the years. How do you see it playing out from here?
There are a lot of moving pieces as it relates to your gas portfolio, but one would be -- just any thoughts
around spot cargoes? And the other would be, it looked like you had some timing effects in the quarter
that supported earnings. I would think that would unwind later on, but just any modeling advice there? So
a lot of moving pieces there, but your thoughts on the gas portfolio.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Neil. First, I'd say that we are seeing high gas prices. It does feel more cyclical than structural.
We've seen demand very resilient through COVID on natural gas, in particular. And supply has been
impacted in part by lower associated gas, just a slowdown in some supply activity.
So seeing demand and supply a little bit out of sync is something that we've seen in the past, and we
expect that markets will work. We're seeing in commodity pricing right now, and we expect markets to
rebalance over time.
We have a very strong natural gas business. We have a nice position in North America, Australia, Eastern
Med through Noble Energy and in Africa. And so we're well positioned there. There's not much in the short
term that we can really do to increase supply. We have a position in the Haynesville and we could increase
activity there. But that will have a modest impact on a company of our size.
I think over the medium to longer term, we're working expansion opportunities, particularly in the Eastern
Med. And I think this is positive for signing up customers and enabling kind of the next phase of expansion
there. So it's something that we're certainly well positioned for, and we're looking to expand supply into it.
In terms of the quarter, a couple of things. Yes, we did have a trading timing effect that was related to
LNG. And that's really tied to how we manage our overall portfolio pricing. So we have customer contracts
that are oil-linked and JKM-linked, and then we have various supplies and we try to match up the pricing.
And in order to do that, we essentially went along some JKM paper, which clearly was mark-to-market
positive in the quarter.
Now that's going to be matched against some physical deliveries in future quarters. So we call that timing
because we expect to see that unwind when those physical cargoes are delivered.
And then the last piece of guidance we had was really on fourth quarter earnings effects. We guided
towards $50 million of increased earnings in 4Q versus 3Q from Australia LNG spot cargoes. And that's
just to make the point that we are going to have spot cargoes. We have all 5 trains operating. The
Wheatstone planned turnaround is complete.
And we'll have actually more cargoes delivered in fourth quarter when you think of contract and spot.
But because it's heading into winter and most of our -- many of our customers are in the Northern
Hemisphere, their nominations seasonally pick up heading into the winter. And so they will have higher
takes under the long-term contracts, which are oil-linked, and that means we'll have fewer cargoes getting
the higher JKM prices.
So higher prices clearly in JKM 4Q versus 3Q, fewer cargoes, that's a net benefit of about $50 million. We
also have some exposure out of our both Angola LNG and Equatorial Guinea. And so you can think about
another $50 million or so from spot cargoes from those operations.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
So -- sorry, it's a long answer to cover the full breadth of natural gas this quarter.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
No, there's a lot of moving pieces. Now that's great. And then, Pierre, you're tracking really well on CapEx
this year. Now I think initially $14 billion, then $13 billion, now it looks like as low as $12 billion. Next year,
if I remember, CapEx is $15 billion to $17 billion is the range that you talked about.
Is it fair to assume that the lower capital spend this year would suggest that you'd be on the lower end of
that range? And any moving pieces that you would -- we should think about as you set up the '22 spend
level?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
You'll see us increase capital in the fourth quarter just to get to that $12 billion to $13 billion because
we're at $8.1 billion through third quarter. And you'll see that in the Permian, 2 more rigs, 2 more
completion crews. We'll have higher activity levels at Tengiz. We're going to maintain peak manpower
through the winter. And then activity tends to be back loaded, so -- back-end loaded. So we have some
project milestone payments. We have exploration wells that we'll be drilling in the fourth quarter. So you'll
see an increase in fourth quarter.
I think we'll announce our 2022 budget in December like we normally do. It will be within the guidance.
And I think it's fair to say it will be towards the low end of the guidance. Again, even being at the bottom
of the guidance of $15 billion of organic capital, that's at least a 20% increase of the midpoint of the
guidance we just gave for this year. So -- again, I don't want to get ahead of that, but you should expect
us to see capital in the lower end of that guidance range.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Pierre, I hate to ask a housekeeping question, but you got to help me out here a little bit on tax. The way
I'm thinking about this is that there's been a lot of changes in -- post Noble. Your mix has changed. And
obviously, we've got a lot more profitability in the U.S. with a low tax rate.
So can you help me is, what was going on with tax sustainable? Or was it a mix issue? Or was there
something unusual going on because we saw your tax rate a bit low and I'm worried that we are carrying
too high a tax rate going forward.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
The tax benefits in the third quarter, which we cited, are real. So this is a deferred tax asset. It was
acquired through Noble. At the time of closing the transaction, we put a valuation allowance against
it because these tax attributes have a -- they expire after a certain number of years. And based on
projections of financial performance at that time, we thought they would expire without us being able to
use them.
Our financial performance is so much stronger that we actually were able to use them in the third quarter.
So that reduces our taxes, both on an earnings and on a cash basis. So it's very real, and it's an additional
synergy from Noble and it's not something that was included in our synergy estimates.
That is not something that necessarily will recur. We'll do a review of all of our tax attributes at year-end
and see again what deferred tax assets could have value going forward based on the changing conditions.
But again, I would cite that, that was in the All Other segment. It's not something that you would expect
to recur.

Well, it's the primary variance in that segment. So we talked about lower corporate charges and tax
benefits.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
All right. Got it. My follow-up is really -- I hate to bring the balance sheet issue, but obviously, going back
5 years ago, you guys didn't carry any net debt. Admittedly, you had a lot of projects going on back then.
But when you think about the cost of debt, which is obviously very, very low, and we'll see if it stays there,
versus the way you think about the per share dividend growth.
So I'm trying to think Exxon talks now about 20% to 25% has been the right level for them. It seems that
you're heading well below that kind of level. So what is the right level for you given that you can obviously
refinance at a very economic level and, obviously, step up the buybacks if you chose to?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
When I became CFO, we -- I answered this question that we didn't have a hard target on our net debt
ratio. But 20% to 25% is a good place for us to be through the cycle. And there could be times where we
go above it. For example, when we showed our stress test, the only company in the industry to show a
stress test last year at $30 Brent for 2 years to give confidence to our investors that we could maintain the
dividend, our net debt ratio did go above 25%. So that's appropriate.
We do not need to be anywhere close to where we were before with no net debt. But when prices are
above mid-cycle, we should be below the low end of the range, and we are. We got to less than 19% now,
and we're fast approaching a range where we could increase our buyback guidance. So it's very close to
where we're at.
All the excess cash that we'll be generating under these conditions. And we show that at $60, even prices
well below where we're at now, that we can generate $25 billion of excess cash over 5 years. This is cash
in excess of our capital and our dividend. All that cash will be returned to shareholders over time in the
form of a rising dividend.
And again, our dividend is up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector, and a buyback
that's ratable and we maintained through the cycle. We bought back shares 14 in the last 18 years. And
so when we set a buyback rate, we intend to maintain it through the cycle. That means we'll maintain it
when the cycle turns and which means that we can, in fact, be doing it off of debt for some time period,
and we'll rebalance back into the range when we continue to buy back shares if and when the cycle does
turn down.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
We wanted to follow up on Devin's question and I guess, Doug's question as well, getting back to the
buyback. Pierre, you've already commented that you plan to maintain the buyback through multiple years,
through the price cycles, which is great. I think we remember prior commentary that the goal is to not
have to reduce the buyback once it started.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
So we wanted to just check in on that and how you think of the trajectory of any buyback increases. It
sounds more ratable versus opportunistic. We know there's a tremendous amount of free cash flow coming
our way. But also it seems like investor expectations are running alongside that versus being more ratable
and that the strip is backward dated. So we just wanted to kind of check in on the trajectory.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jeanine. If you look back to our history, we've never ended a buyback program at the rate that
we started. We tend to increase them. And I think you might be right that we haven't decreased them.
Look, I'm not opposed to that. We have a range, we're using the range, right? We were in the middle of
the range in the third quarter. By the way, it's the first quarter that we -- since we've resumed buybacks.
We bought back shares in the first quarter of last year pre-COVID. And now we're using the top of the
range. And as I said, we're fast approaching a net debt level where we can increase that guidance range
further.
So no, our focus is on being ratable and maintain it through the cycle. Investors -- our investors, our
shareholders have different views on buybacks. Where we have the most common ground is do it
consistently and do it through the cycle when times are good and when times are tougher. And so we're
setting the rates at a level that we have confidence that we can maintain it through a commodity price
cycle.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. Our second question is really on the Permian and the outlook on capital allocation. Can you
just talk a little bit about what you're seeing on inventory and supply demand? And maybe how close are
you to potentially accelerating in the Permian, a little bit beyond of what you've already laid out? And I
guess on that, we know that it doesn't get much attention, but could you also be thinking about increasing
activity in other short-cycle plays?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We're going to increase capital in the fourth quarter and into next year. And so that will be in the Permian
and that'll be in other locations. Again, as I said, even the bottom end of our guidance range, $15 billion,
represents at least a 20% increase from where we expect to end up this year.
And we're seeing that in the fourth quarter. We'll see 2 additional rigs in Permian, 2 additional completion
crews. We're beginning to see a non-op pickup also. Again, that's part of the reason why we lowered our
guidance. Non-op has been a bit below our expectations. And you can see it in other basins. We have
a great portfolio with a number of short cycle investments. But we're not changing our overall CapEx
guidance range.
Our CapEx guidance anticipated that we would be in a recovery mode and it would increase over time, and
we showed a 5-year outlook on the Permian that shows that we can grow production as an outcome of a
very capital efficient and also carbon-efficient development of resource that we can grow that production
from 600,000 barrels a day to 1 million barrels a day.
So we're executing our plan. There's really no change in what we're doing. It's playing out the way we
expected and seeing a buildup in activity in the Permian and across other parts of our portfolio is what we
had planned to do, and we're going to do that in a very capital and cost-efficient way.

We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
Pierre, first question here, just kind of circling around the capital allocation base a little bit more. Back in
March, you talked about having $25 billion of excess cash or greater than $25 billion in excess cash over 5
years at $60, implicitly suggesting the dividend would be covered around $50-ish Brent, I believe.
I'm just curious as you progress through this year, the performance that you've seen, et cetera, has
anything changed with that to make you think that, that breakeven would be moving lower? Or is that still
an area where you're comfortable with?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
That's an area where we're comfortable with. It's just keeping oil prices constant, right? We're seeing Mark
Nelson's Downstream & Chemicals group perform very well. We've talked about natural gas pricing being
strong both in North America, Europe and international LNG. So those things aren't held constant.
So if you look at this quarter's results, I think you'd see our breakeven would be a little bit lower. But in
terms of mid-cycle assumptions for refining margins, chemical margins, natural gas prices, and then an oil
breakeven about $50 is certainly where we're at.
Now that -- of course, that changes as our dividend goes up and other things over time because it's a
dividend breakeven, it's covering our capital and our dividend. But that math is still intact. We are a better
company than we were a few years ago. We showed that chart where our costs are lower, our production
is higher, and we're much more capital efficient. We can sustain and grow this enterprise with less capital,
and that helps us deliver higher returns and lower carbon.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Got it. Okay. And then just a follow-up question on Wheatstone. There were some reports from your
partners about reserves being written down there. I just wanted to get your commentary, how do you
think about this? Does that mean something in terms of future capital requirements given that it's a
longer-cycle project? Just any commentary you have there.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
It's unrelated to Chevron. So if you recall, the Wheatstone project was the first project in Australia and
maybe the world where there was third-party -- the reserves, the resources came from 2 different joint
ventures. And so it was Apache at the time and now it's Woodside. So it was really Woodside announcing
that the fields that supply their portion of -- that's toll through Wheatstone that those reserves have a
write-down.
Chevron does not have an interest in those reserves. So the fields -- the Chevron fields that supply
Wheatstone are not affected. And again, it's unrelated to Chevron activity. It's only that they essentially
-- we share the facility through them, and those fields are also being processed through. Wheatstone is
doing very well. We had a planned turnaround that covered a portion of third quarter and early into fourth
quarter.
As I said, it was completed last week, and we expect to have all 5 of our Australia trains operating this
quarter. And as I said, we expect more cargoes. There's a lot of focus on JKM. But of course, our oil-linked
contract prices will also be higher because they adjust with -- oil prices are higher and then they adjust
with oil prices on a 3- to 6-month lag.

We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
Maybe a high-level question. You did your Energy Transition Spotlight event a little while back. You said
a share of the capital budget close to -- low carbon businesses being close to 10% of the capital budget.
You've seen one of your peers here in the U.S. raise theirs to a similar level.
As you think about the feedback that you've received since then, I mean our view was that it was a
pragmatic balance between allocation of capital towards good low-carbon businesses, but not too much to
kind of protect returns dilution going forward, is 10% of the budget -- as you've seen feedback over the
last couple of months. Do you view that 10% of the budget is enough? Or do you think that's going to be
something where you're going to see increasing pressure to kind of creep that higher going forward?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'll start, and then I'll ask Mark to talk a little bit about some of our renewable fuels activities in his
portfolio. We have good shareholder support and alignment for our strategy and objectives of higher
returns, lower carbon. That's both lowering the carbon intensity of our traditional operations and then
growing low-carbon businesses that leverage our strengths, our capabilities, assets and customer
relationships. And they target the sectors that cannot be easily electrified, the hard-to-abate sectors.
So this is things like air travel, industrial emissions, heavy-duty transport. The $10 billion of capital is
connected to some pretty ambitious targets that go up to 2030. So 150,000 tons per annum of hydrogen,
25 million tons per year of carbon capture and storage. That's all consistent with that capital guidance. So
we are more in the execution mode and getting it done versus, let's say, competing on CapEx targets. It's
not easy to do. These are ambitious targets. They have challenges, lots of opportunity.
But let me ask Mark to talk a bit about his portion of that on renewable fuels.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Thanks for the question, Ryan. I could use a real tangible example. You think about our El Segundo
refinery and our diesel hydrotreater conversion. We've said a few things are really important to us when
it comes to renewable diesel. We've said that the ability to sell it at the appropriate margin, the ability to
have the right kind of feedstocks and the ability to be capital efficient is critical for us to be successful. And
Southern California and the El Segundo refinery are an example of all of that.
We've already increased our sales -- we're getting close to 40%, but let's say over 30% of renewable and
biodiesel in Southern California. We have our Bunge joint venture, where we're working towards definitive
agreements as we speak, and yes, they're already supplying us at the El Segundo refinery.
And finally, and perhaps most importantly, capital efficiency. We indicated in our Energy Transition
Spotlight that we expect to be a leader in the capital conversion of particular hydroprocessing units in our
system. And we believe we can do that for less than $1 per gallon of annual capacity, and that's including
any pretreatment requirements.
So that gives us the ability to produce both renewable diesel and conventional diesel just with the catalyst
change, if that's necessary. So when you step back and you think about that work that's been done
initially at El Segundo, where we did our coprocessing investment for very, very little money, we were able
to test tanking and piping and metallurgy needs.
And now we're working towards a full conversion of that diesel hydrotreater here by the end of next year.
That won't be easy, but the team is working really hard on it, making very good progress. And that would
be 100% renewable diesel capacity and over 10,000 barrels a day. Thanks for the question, Ryan.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Great. Thanks, Mark. Maybe a follow-up on some of your comments earlier, Pierre, where you mentioned
-- when you were talking about gas market and you mentioned the Eastern Med opportunities. We haven't
talked about that much in a little while. In your conversations with potential buyers of that gas in the

basin. I mean in the past, when it was operated by Noble, it was -- there was talk of everything between
European targets, to pipelines, to Egypt, to floating LNG and all sorts of opportunities.
Any thoughts on what may look like it makes the most sense there in the Easter Med? And opportunities
for whether it's shorter-term debottlenecking and opportunities there versus longer-term project
development?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All options are still on the table, Ryan, and it's commercially sensitive, so I don't want to show our hand in
any way. I mean the point is that this is a great resource. There's some very low-cost expansions that can
be done and there's some larger expansions that can be done over time.
What's really changed is that was in a geography that a year ago looked oversupplied for natural gas and
now looks much tighter. And so as you know, the natural gas business internationally is really dependent
on getting customers to sign up. And I think customers are more motivated now. And look, it's probably
overdone. As I said earlier, we expect the markets to correct but it is a better time for us to be engaging.
So it's a great resource. And in many cases, is backing out coal. It has expansion opportunities. It's
been free cash flow positive from the moment that we close Noble. So it's just a great asset and it's well
positioned now to have opportunities to grow in the future.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Pierre, if I could start with you. Would it be possible to try and normalize your exposure to LNG given that
there's so many moving parts over the course of the past year or so? I'm just noting that you said during
your comments that your spot exposure will be somewhat different in Q4 as a result of customers pulling
long-term contracts.
If we could just take it apart a bit and sort of normalize into 2022, 2023, where are your volumes? And
how much of that is going to be long term versus spot? If you could have a go at that.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Paul, we'll cover that more in our fourth quarter call when we give full year guidance on a number of
items. We have a long-term contract that will begin next year. So it will take our weighting to long-term
contracts a little bit higher. Again, we've been notionally around 80%. But that's something -- that's why
we very consciously just provided guidance for this quarter as it will change a little bit next year, but we'll
do that on the fourth quarter call.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Okay. If I could move on to Mark, but if I could just slip a quick one in a few. In regards to modeling, do I
assume that we put everything into buyback in terms of free cash flow? Or are there any other items that
you would highlight, maybe pension or something that we should just be aware of going into 2022? And
how much we consider your buyback to be?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Over time, the vast majority of the excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of higher
dividends and the buyback. We did a onetime pension supplement last quarter. It was really tied to the
very low interest rates from a year ago. It sounds like a long time ago.
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
But under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation rules, the funding requirement is fixed by -- on the
year-end interest rates. And so we were a little bit underfunded, and therefore, would have paid a little
higher, let's call it, variable interest rate, essentially, higher than our cost of borrowing. And so that's why
we supplemented it.
Obviously, we're in a much different place in terms of interest rates now and you'd expect our pension
contributions to be -- as they have been, and we provide guidance on pension in our 10-Q filing. So I
would not expect anything on that end.
So again, if you go to our financial priorities, Paul, you know them well. Sustain and grow the dividend.
It's up 12% since pre-COVID, the biggest increase in the sector. Our capital guidance is going to be
up, but it's no change from the guidance range, and it's in a very tight guidance range and very capital
efficient and lower where it was pre-COVID.
We're going to pay down a little more debt. As I said, we're fast approaching a level where we
can increase our buyback range. And so then the balance is excess cash. And over time, it goes to
shareholders. We're not going to sweep it out each quarter because investors are very clear that they
want us to maintain a buyback through the cycle.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
I guess that would mean no specials?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I think it's time for you to ask the question to Mark.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Mark, a very general question, but could you talk about how capacity is changing downstream, both in
refining and in chemicals? Because I know we're adding a lot of chemicals, obviously. We're also shutting
down a lot of downstream.
How -- firstly, is there any way that Chevron is dramatically changing its capacity and exposure
downstream? And secondly, could you talk about that in the context of where you see U.S. and global
capacity? I know this could take 2 hours, I apologize. But if you could generally say how global capacity
has shifted? And the more numbers you could give us, the better.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Yes. Thanks, Paul. So let's start with the refining side of the business. We've -- and use margin as the
proxy for capacity being utilized. We've said demand has to recover for high-value products. Inventory,
it has to fall in the traditional ranges. And then we need some degree of refinery rationalization, either
closures or conversions throughout the system.
If you're in the U.S. today, I think you're seeing much of that demand recovery with Jet still to come.
And that's even with offices not completely open and still some restrictions in place. Inventory tending to
find itself in traditional boundaries and starting to see some closures and/or conversions in some of our
markets, especially the U.S. West Coast, which means the market could be -- could actually be tight on
things like motor gasoline, even Jet 5 or 6 years from now. So you see that in the United States.
If I shift to Asia, I would say that demand recovery on Jet is a little bit behind that of the U.S., especially
given our exposure to Southeast Asia. Inventory reduction falling into those ranges is starting to happen.
Some of that with China stopping some of its exports for the moment. But demand catching up with
refinery capacity in Asia still needs to happen. And that means that we both need some -- perhaps some
rationalization as well as demand just to catch up with the capacity that's there.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
And so my high level comment would be that in the United States, we're seeing the actions to bring
refinery margins into balance over time, getting closer to historic ranges and just a half phase behind that
maybe in Asia. And then for the petchem side of the equation, petchem margins have had a strong run
this year on the back of good demand and considerable supply disruptions.
We would expect to see margins come off as we get to the fourth quarter, normal seasonal type of drop
off. But we're actually preparing for -- with capacity growth over the next few years, we expect that to
outpace demand. So we're at that part of the cycle. And even in 2025, we're presuming we'll be on the
lower portion of the margin cycle. So that means that there will be a period of catch-up there in regard to
demand catching capacity.
I hope I got to your [indiscernible].
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
You did. And just from a Chevron point of view, is there any major changes in your capacity over the next
5 years that you anticipate Refining and Chemicals?
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Other than the comments we've made about -- remember, it was about a decade ago that we did much
about what I'll call rationalization, meaning taking things out of our portfolio. And we've highlighted our
Energy Transition Spotlight that we have this opportunity for this very capital-efficient conversion of
individual hydroprocessing units. And we will certainly do that over the next decade to get to that 100,000
barrels a day of RD SAF capacity.

We'll go next to Roger Read with Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Pierre, I'm going to hit you on capital returns, buybacks and balance sheet. No, I'm just kidding. Mark,
I would like to ask you about the group oil base III (sic) [ Group III base oil ] acquisition, kind of how
that fits in the overall structure. And what we should think about there? And whether or not -- we've seen
some stories about renewable feedstock for Group III, maybe how you see that working in over time?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Roger. As mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're excited about the announced acquisition
of Neste's Group III base oil business and the next base brand. And the reason for that is it's a very
capital-efficient acquisition of both offtake of supply, appropriate qualifications and the brand -- NEXBASE
brand itself.
And what that does for us is it allows us to expand our offering. So we're going to add that to our existing
Group II, II+ and Novvi offering to have a complete offering for the base oil needs for our customers
in the future. And think about the Novvi brand that we've talked about. I think in the Energy Transition
Spotlight, we shared that Walmart would be selling online our Havoline Pro-RS, the first renewable
lubricant line.
And we've actually brought some of that forward. And starting next Monday, we will have our installer
base in North America, specifically the United States and Canada, in particular, running a whole line of
Havoline Pro-RS. So we're creating that demand for the renewable portion of that offering. And it really
gives us something where we can be that supplier of the future for our base oil customers. Thanks for the
question, Roger.

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Yes, absolutely. And then if we could come back to some of the things on the CapEx. You've referenced
delays out of the Gulf of Mexico due to the storms, which totally makes sense. As you look at the
development and some of the exploration, I think, you're looking to do out there over the next couple of
years, is there any change to that? Or any sort of change in the order of projects we should pay attention
to?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
No. We have a steady stream of projects really with Anchor that has been underway, Whale that recently
went through a final investment decision and Ballymore which is coming along. So you'll see a very
ratable development program. Gulf of Mexico is a high-return low-carbon asset, some of the lowest
carbon intensity barrels in our portfolio in the single digits. And is a business that we've been invested
in for decades, have know-how and some competitive advantages and can find attractive investment
opportunities.
So it's sort of a modestly growing part of the portfolio. If you think of the biggest growth that we have
going forward, clearly is in the Permian, which I referred to earlier. Tengiz, a project that we're investing
in and the project is going very well and the project will come on in a couple of years. But when you get
to Gulf of Mexico, the Rockies or Colorado, a few other places that also have very attractive investment
opportunities that can deliver both higher returns and lower carbon.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Two questions. The first one was, just thinking about the balance sheet, because of your conservatism,
the way you manage your balance sheet, you've been able to make some countercyclical moves and Noble
was obviously the most recent one. Given we're at the high point of the cycle now, can you talk about any
plans to accelerate asset sales? I know it's not needed for the balance sheet, but it's interesting to hear
whether you think there are any opportunities out there? And if so, are they across upstream, downstream
or chemicals?
And the second question is on Tengiz. It's good to see that the dividend come through after a number of
years. Are there any loan repayments due in 2022?
And then finally, just a quick comment to say thanks for the PCI calculation tool which you published. It's
actually quite difficult to dig into some of those figures and understand all the variances. So I appreciate
the transparency there.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, thank you, Biraj, for recognizing PCI. Our teams will be very happy to hear that. We wanted to make
a tool that was transparent where you could use it for other companies because I know comparability is
of interest to investors. And so it's based on, again, transparent reporting data and comparability. And so
thank you for taking advantage of that. And I encourage others to check it out.
Let me just talk about TCO because as we look back, we had a very successful spring and summer
campaign there. We hit our productivity targets, and we achieved a lot of our milestones when we had a
full workforce. So we had Delta variant wave, which caused some higher levels of isolation in the middle
of the third quarter, but we ended the quarter with positive rates very, very low, and we're back to our full
workforce.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
And as I mentioned earlier, we intend to maintain a peak manpower workforce level through the winter
months. We have a vaccination rate over 85% for that workforce. So we're well positioned to make a lot
of progress this winter. Now we have to be thoughtful about it because it can get cold there. So we're
sequencing the work in a way that we're saving a work that can be done indoors or in sheltered locations
during the coldest months of the winter.
So no change clearly in the guidance that we provided on second quarter in terms of budget and schedule.
But I wanted to give an update. Things are going very well in Tengiz, and we're looking forward to a very
productive winter season there.
In terms of the dividend, you're right, it's the first dividend in 3 years, so that's nice to see. We did have
a modest loan repay back that occurred last quarter. And look, we'll give guidance on 2022, just like with
Paul's question, when we look forward. It will depend clearly also on oil prices, but that's something that
we'll give guidance on, on our 4Q call.
In terms of asset sales, yes, we acquired Noble when -- or announced the acquisition when Brent was in
the low $40s. And now Brent is in the low $80s. And so it's a commodity business. It has cycles, ups and
downs. And when you buy or sell assets, timing makes a difference, where you are in the cycle. And of
course, strategic fit and all the elements. We're very, very pleased with the Noble transaction.
We talked about timing of it, the first to do it. The synergies that were doubled and the tax benefits that
we saw this quarter and interest cost savings. So we did tender a number of bond offerings earlier this
month. A lot of those bonds are renewable bonds. Again, that was not included in our synergies because
we weren't quite sure we could achieve that, and we'll save over $100 million in interest cost savings.
So Noble just keeps contributing to the company. And that's part of the reason why we're a better
company now than we were several years ago. But it's a different market. So yes, I'd view it more as a
seller's market than a buyer's market right now. And so you're seeing us modestly increase some assets
that don't compete for capital as well in our portfolio. In fact, one of them is our position in the Eagle Ford.
So that was a Noble legacy position.
Chevron legacy was not in it. So we don't have quite the scale that we would like. But again, essentially
buying that position at $40 and now we have it on the market, that's in the public domain. And obviously,
we expect to get much higher value than for what was implied in the purchase price. We have some other
U.S. onshore assets that are on the market, again, that we feel are very attractive to a lot of industry
players, but just won't compete for capital as well in our portfolio.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Two questions, please? First one is for Mark. Mark, you guys did the Pasadena refinery and at the time,
you're saying that it's a one-off because it complemented your Pascagoula refinery. There's a lot -- quite
a lot of refinery available for sale in here. So I wanted to see with the substantial amount of the refining
capacity being shut, does it change the way that how you're looking at that business or that you think you
already have sufficient of the capacity and supplementary and you really don't need to add?
And also in the retail marketing, some of your peers that have been aggressively building that up and
including in the U.S. and you guys have out of that business for more than 10 years. I mean is there any
plan to going back so that on the energy transition, including in the EV charger and all that?
The second question is for Pierre. You talked about, say, the TCO dividend. How about the Angola LNG?
Can you give us some idea that if the current commodity price hold, should we assume every year that
both Angola LNG and the TCO is going to pay the dividend? And any kind of sensitivity you can provide
that if the change in the oil price, how that impact on that dividend payout going to look like?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
All right. Paul, thank you for the questions. I'll take them I guess in reverse order. I think your second
question was really about retail marketing. And as you know, we have 3 world-class brands. And we've
taken a capital-light approach to selling our branded fuels.
In fact, one of the metrics that we often look at is the Opus brand power rating, and we continue to be
well at the top of that list. And what that means is the majority of our retail sites around the world that
you would see are owned by retailers who have specifically chosen our brand. And so we have our brand,
our fuel and generally not our capital. We also happen to have one of the strongest retail convenience
franchising offerings out there -- ExtraMiles that you've probably seen. In fact, I think we hit our 1,000th
site this year with very, very little attrition.
And so we believe that our limited capital approach provides us the majority of the margin and sustainably
delivers high returns and still allows us to stay connected with customers. And the best part of that
offering to customers, today, we have EV charging stations in 7 countries around the world, and we're
partnering with our retailers to continue to expand that offering as customers actually need it.
Your second question was, I think, about the refinery portfolio in general and maybe Pasadena specifically.
We're very pleased with our refining portfolio today. And it's really because of that hydro processing
capacity that we have across our system. It gives us flexibility to deal with the fuels of the future and
renewable fuels, in particular, in a very, very capital-efficient way.
Specific to Pasadena, again, we have an opportunity there. The premise of the acquisition continues to
hold for us in processing our equity crude, being able to supply our own service stations in the Texas,
Louisiana area. And then, of course, having the intermediates back and forth between Pascagoula and
Pasadena. That's all working as we would expect.
And we've shared that we think there's an opportunity there to have very efficient expansion of light-tight
oil processing capacity, and we've hinted that, that's going to be a hydroskimming focus. We're working on
that real hard and look forward to talking more about that next year.
Thanks for your question, Paul. Pierre?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And on Angola LNG, so it's -- in our looking ahead slide, Paul, we guide towards $300 million of return
of capital. It's essentially a dividend. It's just kind of an accounting characterization of it as return to
capital. It's cash is the bottom line.
And in terms of guidance going forward, let's just say Angola LNG does sell into the spot market
essentially both on oil-linked strips and into Europe, TTF or international JKM markets. So it does have
exposure to international natural gas pricing. $300 million will be a nice return of capital here in the fourth
quarter.
And again, just like with Paul Sankey's question, we'll provide guidance for our full LNG portfolio on the
fourth quarter call for 2022. That will include Australia, Angola LNG, and our interest in Equatorial Guinea,
which again is another asset that was acquired through Noble Energy.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Crédit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Two questions. I'll ask them upfront. The first one is I'd like to pick your brain on the mid-cycle chemical
margins here. Historically, we thought the mid-cycle would be more like $0.25. Obviously, right now, we
are more like $0.65. And even though you did say the margins will decline, some of the bigger chemical
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
ethylene players are out there saying, ""We will settle for the next 2, 3 years above the mid-cycle level."" So
while the mid-cycle could be $0.25, you could still see $0.35 to $0.40. So that's the first question.
And the second question is we're seeing you get into the CNG distribution for the first time. And I'm
wondering if this is associated with your strategy of developing RNG and basically controlling the entire
value chain, so you can distribute your RNG that you're going to produce through your distribution
network.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Thanks, Manav, got your questions. So first on petrochemical margins, we indicated, as we look to the
longest of terms, we expect petchem demand to continue to grow in line with the long-term GDP growth.
We believe in kind of the next 4 to 5 years, we do see capacity growth in the next couple of years going
past demand, which brings us towards the bottom portion of the margin cycle.
And so I think we shared in our Investor Day discussions last year that we brought our view down and it's
again erring on the side of conservatism perhaps, but that it was going to be $0.20 per pound in regard to
where we could expect those margins over time. And anything above that, of course, we will take. And it
drives us in our CPChem joint venture to make sure that we continue to work on our unit cost reductions,
which they have done a very good job on, and will continue do going forward.
And so we see that as our number looking forward. And then when I get to your comment on the RNG
portfolio, you read it exactly correctly. Our close on the 60 American natural gas sites is really about us
leveraging our strength. When we talk about renewable natural gas, we say a couple of things. We say it
leverages our strengths and biofeedstocks are really important.
The strengths, in particular, are value chain, activation and partnerships. And the 2 areas where you can
see this at play, actually in the formal presentation, would be in the gas that's now coming from CalBio
from all of the farms that we have there and then our Brightmark activity experiencing their first delivered
gas.
On the 60 CNG sites that -- American Natural Gas CNG sites with Mercuria, that allows us to follow the
request of our customers, if you will, who were trying to get CNG to those customers throughout the --
our portfolio, and that's a first step in doing it and a platform for us to grow.
Operator
Our last question will come from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I may have missed it, but can you just discuss the drivers of why TCO is declaring this dividend now? And
kind of what we should look to, to assess if they'll declare it next year? And just some background on how
we could calculate that.
And then my second question just on cost inflation, what you're seeing across your projects, if it's
impacting TCO at all or any of your either large -- or sorry, long-cycle projects or short cycle in the
Permian?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jason. Yes, I should have mentioned, no TCO is paying a dividend, and it was in the plan, but it
could be higher than was planned, which is why we've guided to a range. Primarily because 2 things. One,
clearly, the macro environment is stronger. So it is -- it produces a light oil that attracts trades to a tight
discount to Brent and with the fiscal terms and the rest of it, it's generating excess cash.
And also we've seen, at the project, some real cost savings. Again, we've seen some deferrals, but that
would be factored into retaining cash in TCO, but we've seen some underlying greater efficiencies, and

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2021 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 29, 2021
we've seen some foreign exchange benefits there. So it's a function of things going well, both from a
market environment and from an execution of the project.
Again, in terms of 2022, we will provide guidance on the fourth quarter call, like we have in prior years.
We've guided historically to that cash flow line, which is the difference between dividends and affiliate
earnings. I think we also might just give separately a range on expected dividends from Tengiz and other
major affiliates.
And then in terms of costs, we're not really seeing any cost increases. Rigs, U.S. onshore rigs are maybe
creeping up, but they're still well below where they were pre-COVID. And in general, the industry is
operating below capacity. So although there are pockets of goods and services that we use that are tied to
the general economy like steel and, clearly, steel is up. But the majority of our costs are tied to industry-
specific major equipment, and that's still operating below capacity. So it could increase in the future. I
know there's a lot of talk about it, but what we're seeing up to date is costs are well under control.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron Corporation,
Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'm Roderick Green,
GM of Investor Relations; and on the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre
Breber, CFO. We will refer to the slides of prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I will turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Roderick. We delivered strong financial results in the second quarter with the highest reported
earnings in over a year. Adjusted earnings were $3.3 billion or $1.71 per share. The quarter's results
included special items totaling $235 million, including a remediation charge in the Gulf of Mexico and
pension settlement costs. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this
presentation.
Adjusted return on capital was near 8%, and we lowered our net debt ratio to 21%.
Strong operating cash flow enabled us to meet Chevron's top financial priorities. Our dividend was up
4%. We continue to execute our efficient capital program, and we paid down $2.5 billion of debt. Despite
lower year-to-date prices and margins, first half 2021 quarterly average free cash flow is near 2018 levels,
primarily due to lower capital and operating costs and contributions from legacy Noble assets.
We're maintaining strong capital and cost discipline. C&E is down 32% from a year ago, and we're
lowering our full year organic C&E guidance to around $13 billion, primarily due to lower spending at
TCO and greater capital efficiency across the portfolio. Operating costs are on track with our March 2021
Investor Day guidance of a 10% reduction from 2019.
Adjusted second quarter earnings were up $6.2 billion versus the same quarter last year. Adjusted
upstream earnings increased primarily on higher prices and liftings. Adjusted downstream earnings
increased on higher chemicals results as well as higher refining margins and volumes. All other was
roughly unchanged between periods.
Compared with last quarter, adjusted second quarter earnings were up about $1.5 billion. Adjusted
upstream earnings increased primarily on higher commodity prices and higher production in the U.S.
Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily from strong chemicals results as well as increased
refining margins and volumes. All other charges were roughly flat between quarters and are running
ahead of ratable guidance, primarily due to tax charges and valuation of stock-based compensation. The
All Other segment results can vary between quarters, and our full year guidance is unchanged.
I'll now pass it over to Jay.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre. Second quarter oil equivalent production increased 5% compared to a year ago. The
increase in production was driven by Noble acquisition and lower curtailments, partially offset by normal
field declines, price-related entitlement effects and asset sales.
Turning to the Permian. We continue to incorporate greater efficiency into our activities. Even with our
reduced activity levels, production is expected to be comparable to last year. Consistent with the guidance
we shared in March, we're adding rigs and completion crews in the second half of this year, delivering an
expected production rate of over 600,000 barrels a day by year-end. For 2021, we expect free cash flow,
excluding working capital, to exceed $3 billion, assuming an average Brent price of $65 a barrel.
We're committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our Permian operations. One recent example is our
shift from diesel fuel to electricity and natural gas to power drilling rigs and completion spreads. This
reduces emissions, reduces well costs and takes trucks off the roads, which results in higher returns and
lower carbon.
At FGP-WPMP, overall progress is at 84%, with field construction 69% complete. We've recently reviewed
our cost and schedule targets. At this point, the net schedule extension from the pandemic is expected to
be roughly 1/4 for WPMP and 2 quarters for FGP. Our cost target remains $45.2 billion, as cost reduction
efforts and favorable exchange rates offset an estimated $1.9 billion of incremental cost associated
with COVID. The COVID costs include mitigation efforts, demob and remobilization costs as well as the
expected schedule extension I just mentioned. Although the total project cost target is unchanged, we
have increased the project contingency to $1.9 billion to recognize the schedule uncertainty associated
with the virus and its variance. The project is currently at peak workforce, and our primary focus is to
mitigate the impact of the virus with vaccinations, testing and isolation protocols to enable our workforce
to achieve its productivity.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ballymore project is being developed as a subsea tieback to our
existing line face facility. The project facility entered front-end engineering and design and remains on
track for a final investment decision next year. Earlier this month, we sanctioned the Whale project,
which has the potential for future expansion. Fabrication of the Anchor project remains on track, with
assembly of the production facility hall underway. In Australia, we've sanctioned the Jansz-Io compression
project, which will support the flow of natural gas to Barrow Island. Repairs to the Gorgon propane heat
exchangers are complete, and we now have all 5 operated LNG trains online in Australia.
In Colorado, our newest generation of production facilities have eliminated the tanks and flare system to
deliver a carbon intensity of only 6 kilograms of CO2 per BOE. The new facilities also have a 60% smaller
footprint, higher reliability, and 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost than a traditional facility design, another
great example of higher returns and lower carbon.
Back to you, Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jay. In May, we closed the acquisition of Noble Midstream. With this transaction complete, we
have fully integrated Noble and have achieved greater than $600 million in synergies 3 months earlier
than previously guided. We also started up a mixed feed cracker at GS Caltex and plan to be at 100%
of design capacity in the third quarter. The project was completed under budget and 5 months ahead of
schedule.
In the third quarter, we're resuming our share repurchase program at a targeted annual rate of $2 billion
to $3 billion. This is a rate that we believe is sustainable through the cycle while continuing to pay down
debt.
The restart of our program is consistent with our financial priorities and builds on our track record. We
have a history of buying back shares consistently in meaningful quantities and at a price close to the daily
ratable average over the entire 17-year period.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
We're continuing to grow lower carbon businesses. This quarter, we started coprocessing bio feedstock at
our El Segundo refinery, growing renewable diesel production in a capital-efficient manner by leveraging
existing infrastructure. We recently announced an MOU with Cummins to develop commercially viable
businesses in hydrogen. Also, we've completed front-end engineering on a carbon capture project for
emissions from the gas turbines in 1 of our California cogeneration facilities. This project leverages 2
innovative technologies, CO2 concentration and carbon capture, and has the potential to scale across our
full fleet of turbines.
Finally, yesterday, we announced the creation of Chevron New Energies, a new organization reporting
directly to the CEO. This is an important step to build fast-growing, profitable new energy businesses to
further advance a lower carbon future.
Now looking ahead, in the third quarter, we expect major turnarounds to reduce upstream production by
150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily at TCO, which also reduces our expected curtailments
to about 5,000 barrels per day. We expect to make an incremental pension contribution in the third
quarter of $500 million. This is a onetime payment in addition to our regular quarterly contributions.
With higher operating cash flows, TCO expects to pay back part of its loans this year versus our prior
guidance of increasing its debt. There's no change in TCO's expected dividend this year. We've adjusted
the guidance on the affiliate income line to reflect higher expected TCO earnings. Also, we expect higher
dividends from CPChem, in line with our share of higher earnings.
On September 14, we'll be hosting our energy transition spotlight to provide more details on how we plan
to lower carbon intensity in our operations and grow lower carbon businesses. We invite you all to join us
for this video webcast.
Our objective is unchanged: higher returns, lower carbon. During this quarter, we continue to make
progress towards this goal, delivering stronger financial results and achieving important lower carbon
milestones. And with oil prices well above our dividend breakeven and an industry-leading balance sheet,
we will resume share buybacks, sharing part of the cash upside with our investors.
With that, I'll turn it back to Roderick.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Pierre, I want to pick up where you left off there on capital allocation. You announced a $2 billion to $3
billion buyback, which adds about $5 a barrel to your breakeven, which I think is about $50 inclusive of
the dividend. So obviously, you want to have a sustainable plan. You've always talked about that. Oil's at
75% now. So I guess help us put this in context. I mean we have $15, $20 a barrel actual oil price at this
point, and your leverage is at 21% net debt to cap. So do you want to keep driving down debt from here?
Or how are you thinking about things?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Phil. By resuming the program, we'll now be 14 of the last 18 years that we have repurchased
shares. So that's more than 3 out of every 4 years. And we're doing it at a level that allows us to continue
to pay down debt. As you say, with prices above $70, our debt levels should head below the range I've
talked about of 20% to 25%. That 20% to 25% net debt ratio range is really, over the cycle, kind of
implies prices between $40 and $60, like we talked about during our Investor Day. But again, with prices
well above that, we should head below the bottom of that range.
In terms of the breakeven, I mean, this is our fourth priority from a financial perspective. And so it is
-- we feel it's sustainable. We intend to sustain it over the cycle. But I don't necessarily view it as a
commitment, like we would say our dividend is, and bake it into the breakeven calculation.
But the last thing I'll say is on our Investor Day, we showed that at $60 flat Brent nominal over 5 years,
we can generate more than $25 billion of excess cash. That's cash in excess of our capital and our
dividend. And so you see us starting this buyback program at $2 billion to $3 billion a year. It shows that
we have more than enough capacity to sustain that at reasonable prices.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then the second question, just on the CapEx side of things, the $1
billion reduction. You said it was a combination of Tengiz timing and the efficiencies. Is there any further
breakdown you could give on those 2 factors? I'm trying to think about how some of this might carry
forward as we look at the longer-term $14 billion to $16 billion range you've talked about.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Let me start, then I'll pass it over to Jay. So we lowered our guidance for this year only to $13 billion.
As you say, it's primarily due to lower spend at TCO, in part, from work that's being deferred, and then
greater capital efficiencies across the portfolio. I think you can view that as about 50-50. It's a half project
that's being deferred and half greater capital efficiency. There's no change in our long-term guidance, our
guidance through 2025 of $14 billion to $16 billion. But Jay, maybe you could talk about some of the ways
we're being more capital efficient.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. It's really across the portfolio, as Pierre said. But in particular, drilling and completion activities, the
Gorgon Stage 2 project in Australia has been very efficient and gone ahead of plan from a cost standpoint.
The Permian drilling and completion and other U.S. shale and tight has been very efficient. And then we're

seeing just overall good discipline on costs, making sure every dollar count. And it's really consistent with
operating in not only this COVID environment, but operating with a very disciplined mentality throughout
the organization.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey with Sankey Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Just a follow-up, if I could. You guys obviously have the mega project at Tengiz as an ongoing
development, but the history of these mega projects has been somewhat troubled by very high costs in
CapEx. Is Tengiz going to be the last mega project, do you think? And beyond that, would we really be
looking at the Permian as a sort of fragmented, but mega development? Is that what we're looking at?
And is that how your CapEx guidance that you just repeated, is that sort of how that's set up, that we
won't see another mega project developed by you or perhaps by any major western oil?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Paul. In the oil industry, you never say never. But look, we've talked before that as we move
forward with the asset and the portfolio that we have, the preponderance of our capital, 60% and more,
is going to be going into shorter-cycle high-return projects, which are very quick to bring new production
on. We have low preproductive capital. They tend to be very efficient. And we can adjust based on market
conditions and react quite rapidly.
But that doesn't mean all of our investment will always be in just short-cycle. The deepwater continues to
be an important part of our portfolio. It has a very low carbon footprint, and it tends to have high returns.
And so we've seen projects like Anchor and Whale and Ballymore in the queue. And we'll continue to see
those roll in, but we're going to do that in a very disciplined way. We talked at the Investor Day about how
we are taking action to make these capital projects more efficient, more effective, going to the minimum
facility objectives and really building only what's necessary to deliver the returns that we're looking for.
And I think that whole approach as well as it being a relatively small amount of our capital is going to lead
to a much more efficient and higher return outcomes.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
And then the follow-up would be, Pierre, how did you come up with the $2 billion to $3 billion of buyback
annually? Can you just talk about the parameters, maybe the oil price assumption?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, we're thinking of a range of oil prices. We -- I've said in the past, Paul, as you know, that we would
start a program when we were confident we could sustain it over the cycle through multiple years, based
on our confidence in excess cash flow and the strength of the balance sheet. And so you certainly can
assume that both of those criteria have been met.
In terms of the level, it is to continue to pay down debt while we're having these prices. So it's nothing
really more than that. Again, as I said earlier to Phil's question, with prices above 70%, our net debt ratio
should be below 20%. And so this is a range that allows us to continue to do that. This also gives us a
range to deal with uncertainty. We feel good about the macro, but undoubtedly, there's variance out there
that can impact demand, and you have OPEC+ still having curtailed volumes. So that flexibility is inherent
in the range.
It also gives us flexibility to buy more or less depending on the strength of Chevron's stock price, which
we've heard from shareholders who have said they want us to try to beat the daily average. I showed a
chart that says, we don't buy high. We buy very close to daily average. But if we can do a bit better and

use some discretion, we've heard from our shareholders that they'd prefer that. So that's the thinking that
goes behind the level, the range and the timing.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Jay, I wonder if I could go to you first, maybe a small follow-up to Paul's question. It seems to us that
there's a lot going on in the Gulf of Mexico that's kind of flying under the radar. You mentioned Ballymore,
Whale and Anchor. You've got Leopard, you've got nonworking interest in Leopard and Puma, and a few
other things going on. And this obviously has been a legacy infrastructure area for you guys, very efficient
capital, tieback opportunities and so on.
So I just wondered if I could ask you just to give us a quick update as to what your activity level is there
and what your longer-term plans are because it seems there's a lot more going on than perhaps you've
laid out for The Street at this point.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, the Gulf of Mexico has been an important part of our portfolio for a long time, and it continues
to be. We're one of the largest leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico. But importantly, what we've been
doing is focusing our new lease acquisitions to primarily concentrate in those areas where we already
have infrastructure. And as we've talked before, with our focus on returns, we're looking for those
opportunities where we can do exploration. And if we find something that's normal, it can be tied back
into our existing infrastructure, much like a Ballymore. If we find something that ends up really big and
justifies a greenfield development, we can go the route of a Whale project, where we continue to focus on
the minimum functional objective, building facilities that are replicative in nature so that we are building
on the learnings of the past.
We've developed a deepwater asset class, so we're taking learnings from the Gulf of Mexico, from West
Africa, from deepwater Australia, sharing those rapidly between these different asset groups to make sure
that we're staying on the forefront of efficiency.
So we have an exploration program that's laid out. We keep that at a pretty low level these days so that it
can be very efficient, very focused. We have a good resource base across the portfolio, but we're always
looking for that next high-return, low-carbon barrel. And the Gulf of Mexico represents a good hunting
ground for that.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Sorry, Jay, I don't want to press you, but I mentioned a couple. Leopard, Puma, and I think you've got
Silverback as well. Can you give us an update on those?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We will release information on those in due course. But at this point in time, we're not sharing information.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Pierre, my quick follow-up is plenty of cash flow coming in, extraordinary capital efficiency. As Paul pointed
out, not a huge amount of big projects in front of you. What are you thinking currently on M&A? Because
clearly, you did a fantastic job incorporating Noble. What's your latest thinking in terms of where that
might fit in the use of cash going forward? And I'll leave it there.

Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, we're very happy with Noble. As we just said, we've sort of declared the integration complete. More
than double the initial synergies, completed NBLX. We were the first to announce, first to close quality
assets low premium and done at a good time from an exchange ratio perspective.
As you know, we're always looking. We have a very high bar. And we certainly don't need to do a
transaction. We just talked about our portfolio and how we can sustain and grow it in a very capital
efficient way.
Just the last thing I would say is, and we've shown this, that we don't really view cash as being something
that's required to do M&A in our business. With oil prices volatility doing it on a stock basis, as we did
with Noble, makes a lot of sense. It kind of keeps you hedged in case prices go up or down between a
buyer and seller. So I wouldn't connect any kind of balance sheet actions as being an indicator one way
or the other on M&A. We're going to be disciplined with our capital. It's all capital, whether it's organic or
inorganic. And of course, we'll only take action if we see it in the interest of our shareholders.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Jay, the first question is for you on Tengiz. I appreciate the update here. Can you just go through some of
the modeling work that you've done to get to that $2 billion of contingency and give investors your latest
read in confidence interval around the cost. It did seem like a good update relative to what was feared.
And the summer is always so important in Kazakhstan. Just talk about the key things you're going to be
watching for over the next couple of months to ensure that you're on track.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Neil. I'd be happy to. At TCO, the team has just done an extraordinary job of responding to the
impact of the virus. And as we've said, we've been able to capture cost savings, which have largely offset
-- along with some of our foreign exchange gains, offset the incremental cost due to COVID. So at this
point in time, we've reached our peak workforce on FGP. And so we are maintaining that workforce. It is
something where we have to continue to stay focused on mitigations, particularly with the rise in the Delta
variant and other variants that we are exposed to.
The vaccination program continues to go well. We have 42,000 members of our workforce that have
gotten their initial dose and about 30,000 that are fully vaccinated now. And we continue to try and work
with the Khazak government to increase those numbers.
Because we were so successful in completing the fabrication, and that fabrication was done with such high
quality and it's been proven to be now dimensionally accurate, we've had our modules showing up at site
within 1 to 3 millimeters of accuracy on where pipes land and the connections between modules. It's really
helped us move forward from that standpoint. All of the modules going through the shipping program to
arrive at Tengiz, they've all been successfully moved to site, restacked and set on their foundations. So we
have that entire program behind us now.
All the heavy equipment for the project has been set on foundation throughout the project, so our heavy
lift program is complete and being demobilized. And now we're just focused on the interconnections and
the hookup and preparing for the turnover to completions and startup.
So normally, at this point, we would be decreasing our contingency because we have eliminated so many
of the traditional risks. But in this case, we've actually increased it to $1.9 billion, and that's primarily due
to our uncertainty around future impacts from COVID. This pandemic is far from over around the world.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
And so while we're doing well and we've been very successful at mitigating any potential impact to this, as
you said, critically important summer, we need to stay that way.
We're monitoring our productivity. We are very focused on being capitally efficient here. Our focus is on
delivering this project at $45.2 billion. We've allowed the schedule to slip a little bit because it's just too
hard to try and catch up. We didn't feel that was a good use of resource. So our predominant focus is on
the cost, and we're managing the schedule within that cost parameter.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Following up here on the asset level, can you talk about how you see the cadence of activity in the
Permian? You talked about exiting the new year close to 600,000 barrels a day. Remind us where you are
right now. And do you see the Permian still as a growth engine for you? Or are you planning on running
the business more for free cash flow and with less growth in mind as we think about 2022?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
In the Permian, we currently -- as you know, we scaled back activity significantly last year, and we've
maintained a lower level of activity. But at the same time, even with a constant level of activity, because
the efficiency is getting better, we're actually getting more output from those reduced levels. We did add
an additional completion crew in July, and we expect to add another one before year-end. We currently
have 5 drilling rigs out there, and we expect to add at least 1 or 2 more in late third quarter and fourth
quarter. So we are seeing our activity levels start to increase in the second half.
As we see markets not in balance, but starting to move in the right direction towards approaching
equilibrium, we'll continue to monitor where we are in terms of the overall market signals that come to us.
But we're going to continue to be very disciplined and focused. Our returns remain the #1 objective. We
are going to stay disciplined around those returns. But we are moving back into more and more efficient
factory drilling again as opposed to having to be focused on lease retention as we were over the last 18
months or so.
So I think the Permian is going to continue to be a critical asset in our portfolio. What we've generated and
demonstrated is that we can generate free cash flow while we continue to grow, and that's because we
maintain that disciplined focus on the balance as we look forward.
Pierre R. Breber

And Neil, in our earnings supplement, we -- a memo item, the Permian unconventional total production.
So it was 577,000 barrels of oil equivalent in the second quarter. Thanks, Neil.

We'll take our next question from Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Two questions. In Permian, Jay, when you're looking at what you're going to do in the next year or the
next couple of years, how you -- whether that the OPEC current curtailment means that whether the
market is still fundamentally long supply or not, does it pay into your decision-making process?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, I think, of course, it does. And that's because we're not just being triggered by an instantaneous
price or some price threshold to signal a need for more activity. As we've talked about, as we gave you
guidance at the Investor Day, we've given you our forward look of the Permian with the expectations of
how markets recover.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
Now we've seen demand recover in the marketplace quite rapidly. And in most of the products, other
than maybe international jet fuel, we're seeing demand starting to return to pre-pandemic levels. But the
supply picture, it's still a fundamentally oversupplied world. And that's why we're being cautious, we're
being balanced, and we're going to continue to monitor the market as we continue to decide how to ramp
up our activity levels in the Permian.
The Permian has very low carbon intensity, so it's a good place for us to continue to develop new barrels
not only for us, but for the world. But it also has high returns for us, so it remains a key target for
increased capital allocation. But we're not going to be driven by an output target or a production target;
we're driven by the opportunity to make returns.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Well, maybe let me just ask it another way, Jay. If you determine next year the market is still
fundamentally oversupplied, will you still grow the Permian production?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We've given you the guidance. We're going to continue to be disciplined as we have in the past, and I'd
rather not speculate beyond that, Paul. I've given you about as much as our thinking as I can.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Okay. The second question. Actually, this is for Pierre. In the next several years, when you're looking at
$14 billion to $16 billion a year in CapEx, do you have a target percentage, how much you're going to
spend in the new ESG initiative and the business?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Paul, yes. We talked at our Investor Day about $3 billion in total to lower the carbon intensity of our
operations and grow low-carbon businesses. That was through 2028. And in terms of updates to that, I'll
wait and put another advertisement for our energy transition spotlight. So that will be September 14. It'll
be webcast to everybody. We will go deeper into our actions to advance a lower-carbon future, and we'll
have more to say then.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Manav Gupta with Credit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
You and your partner recently FID Whale, can you help us with some more details? CapEx, volumes,
anything which will help us model the project a little better so you get credit for it in the estimates?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, thanks for the question. What I would say is we're not the operator. And so for those types of
questions, we'd like to refer you to the operator. They're the best source of information for those types of
things.
I will say Whale is a really good asset. We're happy to invest in this project. We expect low carbon
intensity from the production from this asset. We're looking for good returns. It's also based on many of
the principles that we have been talking about for better capital efficiency. It's based on a minimum facility
objective, where this facility is largely a replica of a previous Gulf of Mexico development. There was great
cooperation between Chevron and the operator to develop just what was the right balance between using

exactly what was done before and what enhancements or innovation needed to be incorporated into the
facility. So we're quite happy with this project and look forward to seeing it progress. But I'll refer you to
the operator for the details.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
My quick follow-up here is CPChem obviously was very strong in the quarter. My question is, at one point,
you and Qatar Petroleum were actually looking to build 2 JV crackers, and then obviously, the pandemic
happened. And so how should we think about those crackers are? Is there a possibility they can be
brought back on the table given the tightness we are seeing in ethylene chain margins? Or should we
think about them as projects which might not be pursued ever?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We're continuing to advance those projects. And when I say we, I mean our joint venture, Chevron Phillips
Chemical Company in partnership with [ Qatar ], as you said. So I'd say the Gulf Coast project is a bit
ahead. Feed was completed late last year, and then we're working together on determining next steps,
including when a final investment decision will occur. And we continue to advance the project in Ras
Laffan.
They both are very competitive projects that work off of low-cost feedstock, ethane feedstock. So they're
an advantage, we think, relative to others around the world. At the same time, Manav, you know it is tight
right now with strong demand, tight inventories and some of the carry-on effects from winter storm Yuri,
but we are seeing capacity additions coming on in the medium term.
And so Mark Nelson, our Head of Downstream, and his team are focused on having very capital-efficient
projects. So it's not enough to just have the ethane feed advantage, but it's having a really capital and
cost-efficient development and that's what the teams are working on.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank of Canada.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
The first one's on Agbami. One of your peers highlighted a redetermination of the Agbami field in Nigeria,
and you're a majority owner. There's actually limited details on this outside of the headlines. But would
you be able to confirm whether this impacted you or you had any change in ownership in that field, and
whether there's any cash impact in the second quarter? And then I have a follow-up on a different topic.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We won't comment specifically on that, Biraj. It's commercially sensitive. We've had a long-standing
practice of not discussing commercially sensitive matters.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Okay. Fine. Second question is actually just a more general question on inflation. Would you be able to
talk about, across services and raw materials and whatnot and what you're seeing, or any worrying tons of
inflation across the portfolio?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We are not. We've talked in the past about isolated areas, I mean, for example, steel costs that go into
our tubulars and our wells is up, but it's a fairly -- it's a small component of a well cost, maybe about

10%. We certainly are seeing tightness in trucking services that has impacted us the time and some wage
labor cost increases there. But I think there's more talk about it than we're seeing in terms of action. I'd
say our COGS is pretty well under control in the upstream and downstream segments.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Stephen I. Richardson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Pierre, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about in terms of the New Energies business, curious,
as you go further down this road and build out this business plan, is you're seeing -- there just seems to
be a consistent theme here, which is policy frameworks in different geographies and are they conducive to
actually building the business. And so curious your perspective on finding enough high-return businesses
that have the right market and policy framework today versus some of the things that you might have to
wait on and just in the context of making sure you don't tie up some capital and some things that have
some externalities. So just curious on that point.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, we operate in California, which has a lot of policy support in this area. And we have -- we're the
leading downstream player here with a leading brand and have a large upstream business. And -- but
you're right, policy does vary, but there's enough policy to advance these businesses.
Now there are 2 main parts to our lower carbon activities. The first is to lower the carbon intensity of our
operations. And that largely is not inherent on policy, or at least certainly the first steps. We put out a
2028 target that has a 35% reduction to 24 kilograms per barrel, and that's something we're taking action
on.
And then we're also advancing lower carbon businesses. The announcement yesterday was really focused
on hydrogen carbon capture. Our downstream team is advancing renewable fuels. We've talked about
renewable natural gas and renewable diesel previously.
What we're trying to do around lower carbon really is connected to our assets, capabilities and customers.
So one thing we're not doing in lower carbon is large-scale wind and solar. And we're certainly having
renewable power supplier operations, again, part of lowering the carbon intensity, but not pursuing it
as a stand-alone business. That's a decision that we're making because we don't feel like we have the
competitive advantage. But when we get to renewable fuels, like renewable natural gas, renewable diesel,
sustainable jet, hydrogen carbon capture, these are areas that are adjacent to our business where, again,
we have capability, we have customers, and we have assets that we can leverage.
We sell to United Airlines. United Airlines is going to buy a sustainable jet. Sustainable jet is going to be a
percentage of jet for some time period, 2%, 5%, 10% mixed with conventional. We're the natural player
in that space. So again, we'll share more on September 14, but that's a little taste of what you should
expect from us.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jon Rigby with UBS.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
I think -- and this is a question for Jay, you've referenced a couple of times carbon intensity around
projects. And I think your -- the operator on Whale highlighted it in the FID statement. I just wondered
whether you could talk a little about that. I was struck actually by the comment also you made in the
prepared remarks around the Colorado very, very low carbon emissions by BOE.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
So a few things. One is, can you talk about how you feature carbon emission profiles into your FID process
alongside sort of traditional NPVs, IRRs, payback periods, et cetera?
And secondly, whether as you look at your portfolio as it stands right now, which obviously been built up
over years and decades, whether there's work that can be done around it that both sold for lower carbon
emissions and actually is, I think, Pierre referenced, if you're adding renewables as a sort of power source,
whether you can actually also make an economic return as well in conjunction with that?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks for the question. It's a pretty broad questions, so I'm going to start broad, but then I'll focus in on
the Gulf of Mexico.
In the upstream portfolio, as we take stock of where we are as Chevron, our entire upstream portfolio,
as best we can determine, sits at roughly half of the industry average for carbon intensity worldwide.
So we're starting from a good position. We've been very focused on starting to bring our carbon down
for some time now. And so we set our initial goals back in 2016 for carbon intensity reduction for the
upstream. Since 2016, we've actually reduced our flaring by 60% and our methane emissions by 50%,
and we've done that largely through what we call the marginal abatement cost curves. And just as we
do in exploration, we don't have every business unit out there making their own independent decisions,
but rather they bring their ideas for carbon reduction investments to the center. And then we look across
the entire enterprise, not just upstream, but upstream and downstream, midstream, and we invest into
those opportunities that give us the greatest carbon reduction for the least amount of capital. And that's in
keeping with our focus on being a higher return company.
What we've been able to find so far is that the projects have been relatively low-hanging fruit. And so
we've seen these big reductions in carbon that's occurred since 2016. And in fact, we reached our 2013
targets -- sorry, 2023 targets in 2020, 3 years ahead of schedule. And so we've already set new targets,
which we talked to you about at the Investor Day in March, for 2028, and that's the path that we're
working towards now. And that's to get down to an average of 24 kilograms of CO2 per barrel equivalent
across the entire portfolio.
Places like the DJ Basin, where some of the Noble teams have done a great job of designing out the parts
of the process that have the highest emissions, have resulted in those huge gains. And so as we said,
not only are we seeing a 15% to 20% lower life cycle cost, we're seeing high reliability, 60% footprint
reduction, and they're down in the 6-kilogram per CO2 per barrel equivalent range, which is tremendous.
To put that into comparison, the entire Gulf of Mexico, our operations last year in 2020, were at 7
kilograms per CO2. And that's why we think it's so important there's good information for policymakers to
understand that places like the Gulf of Mexico allow us to produce a very critical supply of energy to the
United States and to the world, but also do that in a very carbon-efficient manner.
So in terms of our decision-making, these are all elements that we have to balance as we make
investment decisions, but we are bringing these factors and these criteria into the equation as we evaluate
where we're going to allocate capital and how we're going to move forward.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
First, on the buyback. If I recall correctly, last year, there was concern around what OPEC+ would do,
and that factored into both your shareholder distribution strategy as well as your Permian production
strategy. Are you kind of confident now that OPEC+ is going to continue to manage the market? And does
that factor into your strategy to -- or your decision to resume buybacks? Or were those kind of looked at
independently?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
And then secondly, just a clarification on TCO FGP, can you remind us what the free cash flow flip is from, I
guess, 2022, which is the last full year of project spend, to 2024 when the project is fully up and running?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jason. I'll start with the second one. We haven't given asset-level free cash flow guidance for
TCO. You're absolutely right that you will see increased dividends from Tengiz, from our ownership interest
in TCO, both as capital rolls off and as the project starts up. It's a big part of the company's guidance of
10% annual free cash flow growth between now and 2025. A lot of that comes from the Permian, a lot of
it comes from Tengiz.
And as you also know, we'll get the loans repaid back. That shows up in a different part of the cash flow
statement, but it's still cash. So there's nothing asset-specific that we've shared, but it's included in our
overall free cash flow guidance that I'll refer you to our Investor Day. And perhaps as we get closer to the
start-up, we can share that in a more specific way for you all.
In terms of the share buyback, again, we look at those criteria. Are we comfortable we can sustain
it? Confident we can sustain it over the cycle? There are uncertainties I cited. The Delta variant as an
uncertainty and OPEC+. OPEC+ are going to take the actions that are in their interest. We don't have
any greater insight into that. It is an uncertainty. But we have enough confidence in all the investments
and assets that Jay has been talking about. The strong downstream and chemicals performance that
we've seen, the economic recovery that we've seen, the discipline on the supply side that we've seen from
companies in this country and really around the world, that we feel good that we can keep this program in
place for multiple years and also pay down debt while we're doing it.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Ryan Todd with Piper Sandler.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Maybe a quick follow-up on some of the balance sheet conversation from earlier. I know, Pierre, you said
that this is one of those times that with the oil price where it is, you're likely to trend below the 20%
to 25% debt target, net debt target. But is there a floor on the debt level in terms of the balance sheet
where you start to feel like you're underlevered at some point, either from a absolute debt level point of
view, from a debt-to-cap point of view, or even from like an efficient retirement of debt point of view that
would skew -- start to skew excess cash more towards buyback or dividend growth.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, there is. I won't cite a number, and it's because we don't have one internally. I mean there's no
hard and fast number. But undoubtedly, with the flexibility of our capital program, with the cash flow
generation, I mean the reason why I've cited that 20% to 25% range, which is arguably higher maybe
than we would have had it 5 years ago when we had a lot of long-dated capital projects and you would
have won it -- we would have won it, and had, in fact, the debt level quite a bit lower because we had
long-dated commitments.
We are, as we talked about earlier, getting to the -- near the end or a couple of years away from Tengiz
being completed. The vast majority of our capital program is much more flexible, so that gives us this
higher range. So I'd like to get comfortably below it. If you're asking the question, would we increase the
share buybacks, yes, that's absolutely possible. If we get our debt ratio comfortably below the 20% and
then we look out again in terms of our cash flows, we can increase the range.
We showed the history of our share buybacks. We haven't kept it at the rate that we've started it at.
We've increased it at times, we've decreased it. And so you'd expect us to continue to do the same thing.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2021 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 30, 2021
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
And maybe a separate follow-up on energy transition activities. I mean, you continue to be fairly active in
renewable natural gas. You've done a modest amount. I know you mentioned some coprocessing seen in
renewable diesel, or maybe we just don't have a lot of detail on it yet. But how are you thinking about the
opportunity set as you look down the line for renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel? I mean would
you consider doing something more meaningful, including the potential conversion of an asset? Or likely
focus on smaller steps like coprocessing?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, again, we'll share more at the spotlight. The coprocessing that we just started is a 2-stage process,
so we'll be up to the capacity of up to 10,000 barrels a day by year-end. So we kind of brought on the first
phase of another phase. We'll be the first U.S. refinery to co-process through an FCC in the second phase.
And again, that will give us the capability to produce up to 10,000 barrels a day.
We did it this way, in part, because it's very capital-efficient. We are leveraging existing kit. It's literally
just a tank and some pipes, and so we can do this in a very capital-efficient way. There is undoubtedly
growth in renewable diesel on the demand side, but there's also growth on the supply side. Renewable
markets work in commodity markets just like the conventional products do. And so we're going to
continue to be disciplined in how we approach it. And so this is a very competitive project. And I think
you'll see more from us again when we talk about it on the spotlight on September 14.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Just one for me on LNG as an asset class in the context of low carbon. I'm pretty sure it would be below
your target on a per unit basis. But look, gas prices are very high. Globally, LNG prices are very high.
There's some opportunities out there in LNG. And I'm just wondering on sort of Chevron's official position
on how that marries with your broader emissions targets.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, this is certainly a part of when we look at our portfolio, we consider the LNG assets and production
to be part of the upstream. So that's in all of the numbers that we've given you, and we continue to
look for opportunities to make those operations more efficient and lower our carbon intensity. We think
natural gas is an important fuel. It's an important transition fuel. It's going to play a critical role as the
world continues to lower its overall carbon footprint. And so we are going to stay focused on incrementally
increasing capacity of our existing facilities. We'll look at the opportunities to use existing ullage or
upcoming ullage in other facilities to increase our production through those facilities. But most importantly,
we want to leverage the investments that we've already made to continue to focus on higher returns as
we go forward. So it's a part of the portfolio, but doesn't occupy any particular premium or special place.

of your policy and strategies, how you think about various protection. As I mentioned, interest rate swaps,
hedges, sort of all of the above.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, on the commodity price side, we don't have -- except for transportation, but we don't have flat price
commodity hedges. And in terms of our debt, I mean, we tend to have a fair amount of variable debt or
short-term debt, commercial paper and others. But undoubtedly, we also have some term debt that's
at fixed. So I think our average interest cost is around 2%. Our mix is probably less than half variable.
But as you say, we are a very strong credit, very strong balance sheet. And so we don't pay for a lot
for insurance. And we don't think our shareholders want that. I think our shareholders want, certainly,
exposure to commodity prices, so they enjoy the upside and then they want us to maintain a strong
balance sheet. Thanks, Neal.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Roderick Green. Please go ahead.
Roderick Green
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Katie. Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. I'm Roderick
Green, General Manager of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today is Pierre Breber, CFO. We will
refer to slides and prepared remarks that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Roderick. This quarter, we had our best financial performance over last year as the global
economy recovers. Reported earnings were $1.4 billion and adjusted earnings were $1.7 billion or $0.90
per share. Included in the quarter were pension settlement costs and legal reserves totaling $351 million.
Pension settlement and curtailment costs will be a special item going forward. For comparability purposes,
2020 adjusted earnings were recast to exclude these costs. Also found in the appendix of this presentation
is a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
CapEx was down over 40% from a year ago, and we ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 22.5%.
For the first time since the pandemic, cash flow from operations, excluding working capital, exceeded
our cash CapEx and dividend spending. Cash balances ended the quarter slightly higher due to timing
considerations. We expect cash balances to come back down later in the year.
Free cash flow, excluding working capital, was $3.4 billion, up significantly from last year and higher than
the 2019 quarterly average. With oil prices back up to around 2019 levels and downstream earnings still
recovering, higher free cash flow this quarter is driven by the change in cash CapEx, less than half of the
2019 quarterly average.
Maintaining and growing our dividend remains our top financial priority. Earlier this week, Chevron's Board
of Directors approved a $0.05 per share dividend increase, about 4%, that positions Chevron to extend
our streak to 34 consecutive years of higher annual dividend per share payouts. Since 2005, Chevron's
dividend per share has grown over 7% per year, beating the S&P 500 and more than 4x our peer average.
When our first 3 financial priorities have been met, we also have a track record of repurchasing shares,
13 out of the past 17 years. As we look forward, we expect to begin the repurchase of shares when we're
confident that we can sustain a buyback program for multiple years through the oil price cycle. When
making this decision, we'll consider the likelihood of future sustained excess cash generation and the
strength of the balance sheet.
Adjusted first quarter earnings decreased about $700 million versus the same quarter last year. Upstream
earnings increased on higher prices and downstream earnings declined on a swing in timing effects and
lower margins and volumes resulting from the pandemic. Both segments had negative impacts from winter
storm Uri. Other was down primarily due to employee benefit costs. Compared with last quarter, adjusted
upstream earnings were up more than $1.4 billion due to higher prices. Downstream earnings increased

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
primarily due to margins and timing effects, including the absence of last quarter's year-end inventory
valuation adjustment of more than $100 million. Other was down in part due to employee benefit costs.
Upstream production was down 3.5% from a year ago. The increase in production due to the Noble
acquisition was more than offset by a number of factors, including declines, asset sales, winter storm Uri
and OPEC+ curtailments. Winter storm Uri impacted both our upstream and downstream businesses, with
earnings impact of about $300 million after-tax in the quarter. All upstream production has been restored
and major downstream and chemical units have restarted.
We also achieved first gas flow from the successful execution of the oil and gas modernization project in
Equatorial Guinea. This project allows gas from the Alen field to be processed through existing onshore
facilities. Finally, the company announced an agreement to acquire all of the publicly held common units in
NBLX. This stock transaction is expected to close in mid-May.
We continue to take action to advance a lower-carbon future. Last week, we announced an MoU with
Toyota to work together to develop commercially viable, large-scale businesses in hydrogen. Also, we
continue to invest in emerging low-carbon technologies, including announcing 5 venture investments this
year in geothermal power, offshore wind and green ammonia. In addition, we're in the early stages of
developing a bioenergy project with carbon capture and sequestration in Mendota, California. This plan is
expected to convert agricultural waste biomass such as almond trees into a gas to generate electricity and
sequester emissions of 300,000 tons of CO2 annually.
Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production by
90,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia at Gorgon Train 3, where the planned
turnaround and repairs of propane vessels are underway. The impact from OPEC curtailments is estimated
to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Kazakhstan. In Kazakhstan, the FGP project
recently placed the final module on its foundation. Remobilization of the construction workforce achieved
about 95% of the end of first quarter objective. Further workforce additions are expected this quarter.
In summary, it was a good quarter with our strongest financial performance in the year, continued
progress towards advancing a lower-carbon future and a dividend increase while maintaining an industry-
leading balance sheet. During last month's Investor Day, we shared our goal of higher returns, lower
carbon. This quarter was another step in that direction. As we look forward to the next few quarters and
the world gets better control of this virus, I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver stronger financial
performance and help advance a lower carbon future.
With that, I'll turn it over to Roderick.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeanine Wai with Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Our first question here, maybe just a housekeeping item on the numbers. Can you provide a little more
color on the moving pieces for cash flow this quarter? It came in a little below Street expectations. And
I guess, if we're doing it right, we apply your cash flow sensitivity per dollar change in Brent and we're
still coming up with a higher cash flow number than reported despite winter storm Uri. So we're just
wondering if we're missing any other one-offs other than the pension settlement since I know there was a
lot going on this quarter.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Our dividend breakeven the past couple of quarters with weak downstream margins has been around
$50. It was a little higher this quarter. There was nothing operational except a winter storm Uri. It's really
primarily due to some nonoperational items like accruals for legal reserves and taxes. Those are noncash
in the quarter. But when we look at cash flow, excluding working capital, of course, we're taking out that
working capital effect. So those kinds of accruals, which are charges result in a lower cash flow ex working
capital.
Point out, though, that our free cash flow in the first quarter of 2021 was higher than free cash flow
in 2019, even though 2019 had much stronger downstream margins and similar oil prices, and that's
primarily because of the cash CapEx. So I think you're doing the calculation right, the tricky thing about
these cash flow breakevens is you don't hold everything else constant, all the other margins and indicators
and then some of these timing effects on accruals.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe my second question on the buyback and free cash
flow. So on our projections, we see pretty strong near term free cash flow and the trajectory, it really
meaningfully steps up in 2024, 2025, with Tengiz and some of your long-cycle ground projects starting
up in the Permian. So I think to us, this suggests that for the buyback it makes a lot of sense to leg into a
program, kind of similar to what you did in '18 and '19 versus a consistent amount per year, which I think
was the last commentary before the pandemic, which I know changed a ton of things. So can you provide
any thoughts on how you envision the buyback getting reinstated?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We have a track record of buying back shares pretty consistently, 13 of the last 17 years, over $50 billion
of buybacks since that time at an average price in the mid-80s, less than $1 higher than the ratable
price that we've been in for every single day during that whole time period. As I said on the prepared
remarks, when we start a program, if and when we start a program, we'll want to sustain it for multiple
years because we want to get it through the commodity price cycle. Shareholders feel differently about
buybacks. There's a concern that we only buy back when our share price is high. That's a perception.
That's not the reality because I just shared with you the actual numbers, but that's a perception that we
have to deal with.
So at the common ground we find is when we start a program, have confidence that we can sustain it for
multiple years. And we're going to look to those 2 factors, the likelihood of future excess cash generation
and the strength of the balance sheet to weather a down cycle in oil prices that we know is going to

happen. So we're not yet on a sustained global economic recovery. We feel very good about where we are
here in the United States and several other countries, but there are a number of countries where we're
still working to get control of the virus. And so we think it's appropriate to increase the dividend, which is
consistent with our financial priorities.
We don't need -- we're not going to increase the capital this year, and we have tight guidance out 5 years.
We have the balance sheet in a very good place. So yes, in the short term, any excess cash is going to
go to the balance sheet. But over time, excess cash will be returned to shareholders in the form of fire
dividends, like you saw us announced a couple of days ago, and in the form of buybacks over time.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Douglas Leggate with Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Roderick, congratulations on your first earnings call. I wonder, Pierre, if I could just hit what might be the
hundred pound gorilla in the room, which is the acquisition of Noble. The production seems to have kind of
disappeared in the mix, and it's raising some questions, at least from people we speak to about whether
Chevron is under investing to sustain that long-term production capacity. What would your response be to
that?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We're not under investing. We showed during our Investor Day that we're very capital-efficient and on
our $14 billion to $16 billion, we, in fact, are going to go production around 3%. We're not -- that's not
an ambition of us to have production growth. It's an outcome of what's a very capital-efficient program.
Jeanine mentioned we're investing to increase production at Tengiz. We don't have that production now,
and that's $2.5 billion in the budget at Tengiz.
So we have our eye on long-term value through this whole crisis. If you really step back to when this
started about a year ago, we did hit short-term capital pretty hard. We kept our eye on long-term value.
We didn't see the virtue in investing capital to add short-term production in a world that was going to be
oversupply for some time period and arguably still is with OPEC+ barrels constrained. And again, we're not
back to a full sustained economic recovery. But we preserve the options on long-term value.
I'm very cognizant that we have a dividend obligation. We're one of the few companies that didn't cut
the dividend. We're the only company that's increased the dividend. And really a dividend increase that
averages 6% per year during a very difficult time, and we showed during our Investor Day that we have
the capability to grow free cash flow 10% per year over 5 years, and that's coming from Tengiz, which
we'll see in a couple of years, and growth in the Permian when the world needs the barrel. So we're not
going to chase short-term production. We don't see value in that.
Our production guidance for this year is unchanged. It's 0% to 3%. You saw our reserve replacement
numbers. The Noble acquisition undoubtedly has helped. Remember, we showed and Mike showed at
the last quarter call that we've invested, actually the same amount that we expected post COVID as pre
COVID. Pre COVID, we would have said $20 billion a year for last year and this year, about $40 billion.
Organically, we're only going to do about $13 billion or $14 billion each year, that when you add in the $12
billion or $13 billion from Noble, it was exactly where we were pre COVID. So we are not under investing.
We have to sustain and grow the enterprise, but we're doing it in a very capital-efficient way.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
I appreciate the full answer, Pierre. My follow-up is actually related to CapEx. So I guess a quick one, but
you are obviously running well below your run rate for the year. Is that just a timing issue? How would you
expect cadence to look over the balance of the year?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Doug. It is really timing. I mean, first quarter is normally a little light. Winter storm Uri,
obviously, you're not drilling wells when you're shutting in production and dealing with the challenges
of that extraordinary winter event. And then there is just timing of some major capital projects that are
more back-end loaded. So no change to our guidance of a $14 billion organic program. You saw a small
inorganic acquisition in the first quarter number, so that can be different going forward. But from an
organic perspective, we're going to stick with the budget. We're running a little low, as you say, we think
we'll end up pretty close to the budget by year-end.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Phil Gresh with JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Pierre, my first question here is actually a bit of a follow-up on the cash flow in the quarter. There was a
$500 million headwind from affiliate cash flows in the quarter in the cash flow statement. And in the last
quarter call, you had given a guidance for the full year of $0 to $500 million headwind. There was not an
update given in the slides this time. So I was wondering if it was just front-end loaded or if there's any
change to that. And I recognize the affiliates also can tie into the Tengiz co-lend. So has that guidance
changed either?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Phil. We didn't change our guidance because it's just early. I think you're right. I think
you're inferring that the guidance, particularly for Tengiz, will get better. We gave a co-lending guidance
of $1 billion to $2 billion. Right now, we'd be at the low end of the range. And frankly, we could be at 0
depending on if prices stay where there are right now. So you should expect us to update that guidance
at mid-year when we see a little more time with commodity prices. But clearly, at Tengiz, when we have
prices over $60, that reduces the need for co-lending and might not require any. And again, you could
see a dividend out of Tengiz. That's a decision for the TCO shareholders to make, but we have not had a
dividend now for, I think, 2 or 3 years. And so that would also be positive.
In terms of affiliates, I mean that cash flow line again is the difference between earnings from affiliates
and the dividends. The dividends were about flat between fourth quarter and this quarter. So that's not a
variance on the cash flow. But you're right that there's some timing in that, some of the winter storm Uri
effects kind of factor into CPChem. Again, we'll update that guidance when we get to midyear.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And then the second question is on Tengiz. You're obviously continuing to ramp the headcount.
I think at this point, most investors are assuming some kind of delay in the start-up timing as well as
impacts to costs from that potential delay. Kind of hard to overcome maybe a timing delay, but is it
possible that you can still, in your mind, be able to do this within budget, even with the timing delays? I
recognize you haven't given an official update here, but I just want to get your latest thinking.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Phil. Let me just take us back or start with the Investor Day. We were at 22,000. We
remobilized to 25,000, just short of our 26,000 first quarter objective than you saw where we plan to
go in the second quarter. And when I cited also a big milestone was getting the last of 86 modules on to
foundation. So we're still making very good progress. We are managing through a pandemic. We have
all the safeguards in place. They're working. We have a very low rate of positive cases right now. We've
also started a vaccination program at Tengiz. It includes both the project and the producing operations
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
staff. So it's not just for the project, also for the base operations. We've been allocated about 10,000
doses and administered already 7,000. Future vaccinations, though, will depend on more allocations from
the Republic of Kazakhstan. This is not a company program. We're doing it with the government and are
allocated by the government in Kazakhstan.
So to answer your question, at this time, there's more pressure on schedule than costs. We have a
backlog of work because of the demobilization last year and having to isolate work teams at times when
we do have a positive case. It's possible but hard to fully make up the schedule. We also have incurred
higher costs as a result of COVID, but we've had some cost efficiencies and some foreign exchange
benefits that may be able to offset the higher cost.
So as we've said in the past, we need to demonstrate that we can remobilize, fully remobilize, stay at
full numbers, meet productivity targets and achieve our milestones while managing through a pandemic,
and the spring and summer work campaigns are very important to give us the data that will help us get a
reliable update on cost and schedule.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Devin McDermott with Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
My first one is a follow-up on some of the production questions from earlier and it relates more specifically
to the Permian. And I think one of the things that stood out in your recent Investor Day was the fact that
even at a much lower capital spending level, you were still able to achieve a similar level of growth in
the Permian over the next 2 years, deferred slightly versus pre-COVID plans, but still attractive growth
there. As you think about the resumption of activity to facilitate that growth here over the next few years,
can you talk a little bit about the cadence and timing or from a market standpoint, what signals in terms
of oil prices or otherwise that you need to see to begin increasing activity there to resume that planned
production ramp?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We've been focused on 3 metrics -- 3 conditions. So again, oil prices are going to move up and down.
We're focused on the fundamentals. We've been looking into 3 indicators. The first is the global economy
on a sustained path to recovery. Not quite there yet. Clearly optimistic here in the United States with high
vaccination rates on the stimulus package, a few other countries, but again, a number of countries don't
have control over virus. So we need to get on a sustained path of economic recovery.
The second is we need to see OPEC+ barrels, get back into the market. We're starting to see that. We
need to have clarity on what actions they're going to take, but there's still a lot of production that is being
curtailed. And then the third -- and I think the third condition has been largely met. Its inventory are back
to near normal. And so the inventory surplus for the most part has been worked off. So I'd say one of the
3 conditions.
Now that's for us to increase CapEx, not this year, our budget is fixed this year, $14 billion, but within
the $14 billion to $16 billion 5-year guidance that we talked about. So we're still talking about a modest
increase. In terms of the Permian, everything is going very well there. The first quarter production was
clearly impacted by winter storm Uri. That's about 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day for the quarter.
But if you take that out, production, I think, looks good.
Our declines we shared last second quarter, Jay shared that production could decline 6% to 7% if we
stayed at low activity levels. It's probably a little bit better than that. It might be closer to 5%. But
undoubtedly, we're at the low investment levels that we're doing right now. We'll see some declines. That
is okay. That is the correct response to an oversupplied market. In particular, again, when we're keeping
our eye on long-term value.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
So what you could see later this year is we could bring -- right now, operated, we have 5 rigs, 2
completion crews. Our net non-op is a similar rig count. Certainly, we could bring back a completion crew
later this year and that would help us reduce some of our drilled and uncompleted wells. But in terms of
getting on the trajectory, that we showed at our Investor Day, there's still time. I mean, that outlook kind
of factored in that we would still be in this kind of not full recovery at this point in time. And then it ramps
up over next year and the year after that.
So can we do it faster? We absolutely can. Can we hold it where we're at here longer if necessary? We
can. It's very flexible. It's the appropriate response. But the long-term value and the point, I think, of your
question is there, right, the 1 million barrels a day that we showed in 2025, but more importantly, highly
accretive to returns, strong free cash flow, right, free cash flow positive last year, growing free cash flow.
So it's a fantastic position we have. We're advantaged because of the royalty. We intend to invest in there,
but we're going to do it at the right time.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And as we think about decarbonization, energy transition and returns,
I think you've got a very thoughtful approach on that and focusing on returns, enhancing investments,
decarbonizing your existing portfolio, integrating renewables and the portfolio has been one of the pillars
there. You've had some progress here over the past few months in both venture activities, you highlighted
in the slide, the hydrogen MoU.
And my question is, you've seen some of your peers in the industry form new business ventures focused
specifically on commercializing technology and scaling up new business opportunities to hopefully
become growth engines over time, returns enhancing growth engines. Can you talk a little bit more
about Chevron's strategy for transitioning some of the investments and opportunities you've been able
to capture so far into new growth ventures over time, including and a monetization strategy or scaling
strategy for some of the venture investments that you've talked about here in your prepared remarks?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Look, you summarized our strategy pretty well. I'll hit it really quickly. The first is to make the oil and
gas that we produce as low carbon as we can. We put out 2028 targets that have a 35% reduction. We
think we're top quartile, we'll stay top quartile. And we showed a slide that say, we go beyond that and get
the carbon intensity down into the mid-teens in terms of kilograms per barrels of oil equivalent. So that's
the first. That's really done in the segments. That's really where the work gets done.
The second is to increase renewable energy alongside our conventional products. So renewable natural gas
sold along with conventional natural gas, renewable diesel sold alongside our conventional diesel. We've
seen -- we're going to coke process at our LA refinery later this year, biofeed along with conventional feed
and make renewable products, have renewable diesel biodiesel at more than half of our service stations in
the United States. So good progress there.
And then the third is to grow low-carbon businesses. And that's exactly that's hydrogen carbon capture.
The venture investments are important, and they are really making sure we're staying connected to all the
latest technology. But we intend to do exactly what you say is grow these businesses.
So let me talk about project Mendota in California. It's in partnership with Schlumberger and Microsoft.
It's going to capture the emissions from agricultural waste. So they burn almond trees after a certain
number of productive seasons. Normally, those emissions just go to the atmosphere. This project would
capture those emissions, converted into a synthetic gas that can then generate power and use that power
to compress the CO2 and inject it in the ground and then sell excess power into the grid. And that's a
project that's in now front-end engineering and design.
We're looking at another carbon capture pilot with Savante in Bakersfield. So the venture investment is an
enabler to growing hydrogen and carbon capture business. That's exactly what we intend to do over time.
These are nascent businesses require lots of partnerships, but we're going to be a player in it.

We'll take our next question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
So the first one is just on Gorgon. Pierre, can you just talk about the state of play there? It sounds like
Train 3 is going down. And the back half, you're going to be running closer to nameplate capacity. But can
you just talk about maintenance there and where we stand with the project?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Neil, it's pretty straightforward. We're doing our -- the scheduled Train 3 turnaround separately or
it just -- as it turns out, at the same time, we're able to do the repairs. We expect that to be completed
by the end of this quarter. And then you're right, we'd be operating all 3 trains in the second half of the
year. There was a short -- there was a time period in the first quarter where we saw all 3 trains operating
between the Train 1 turnaround and the start of the Train 3 work. So we know what those units can do,
and we're excited to get back to it here in the third quarter. Wheatstone will have a planned turnaround
late third quarter, early fourth quarter. But again, we expect Gorgon to be running full during the second
half of this year.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Pierre, you guys have been really good at M&A, being opportunistic, willing to step away when the
bid went away from you and taking in assets like Noble towards the bottom of the cycle, it's a core
competency for Chevron. As you look at the landscape, how do you think about M&A and whether there
are opportunities out there? And how are you evaluating them?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Neil, yes, we're really happy with the Noble acquisition. Again, if we step back and think of July, it was
still an uncertain time and announcing -- being the first to announce a major transaction, closing it first
in October. Having now 2 quarters where we've been integrated, seeing everything we said, the free cash
flow accretion, the returns accretion, earnings accretion, the synergies doubled from $300 million to $600
million, achieved 80% of them, we'll get the rest before the year-end. Good -- very happy with the talent
from the Noble employees that have come across, DJ Basin, Eastern Med. So again, what was a very good
deal looks even better now.
Now look, it's a challenge to obviously replicate that. We'll always be looking. We have a very high
bar. Noble got over the bar with the quality assets and the value that we saw, we don't need to do an
acquisition. To Doug's earlier question, we are sustaining and growing this enterprise. I'm very cognizant
of that. Again, we need to do that to sustain and grow the dividend. At the same time, there's times
inorganic can enhance the company. And so if we see something that will make that Investor Day story
we told even better, then we'll pursue it. I do think industry consolidation will continue. Undoubtedly, the
valuations have moved from back where we were in July. It's a long game. We're very patient. And again,
we don't need to do a transaction.
Operator
We'll take our next -- Paul Cheng with Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Pierre, 2 questions. First, among your peers that I think you have probably the happier concentration in
California. And with the Governor's latest proposal, how that may impact your overall operation or how

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
you may restructure it or you do need to restructure it? So I want to see that how are you guys thinking
about the policy outlook impacting your business in California, both in the downstream and the upstream?
The second question that if we look at some of the smaller persons, in the last E&P, in the last 12 months,
I think one of the movement is into the variable dividend, which is never, I think, for the major oil
companies, such as you guys, you guys always use share buyback. So just curious that internally that
have the Board and management even consider the variable dividend versus buyback to see which is a
better way to return cash to the shareholders?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sure. Thanks, Paul. I'll answer your second question first. Of course, we pay close attention to what
everybody does. We have not been convinced that there's a better cash return story than what we do,
which is a steadily growing dividend, again, with a 4% increase announced, 34th consecutive year of
growing dividends, 7% compounded rate for the last 15 years and a ratable buyback program, 13 out of
17 years, very close to the actual ratable price during that whole time. So we talk to our shareholders all
the time. I think our shareholders support our framework. But of course, we'll keep an open mind, but we
don't see the value in it.
Look, I think those approaches are gaining favor in part because dividends have been cut by other
companies and other actions that have not been as consistent, as predictable and as reliable as what
we've done over that track record of 34 years on the dividend and 17 years on the buyback.
If you go to California policy, there's -- I'm not sure exactly which one you're referring to. There's an
internal combustion. I don't know if it's a ban or a rule-making proposal to reduce that by, I think, 2035.
There's also a -- the governor requested the rule-makers to look at rules on hydraulic fracturing. What I
can say is that, certainly, on hydraulic fracturing has been done safely in California under comprehensive
regulations for a long time. It's been done safely elsewhere in the United States and safely all around the
world. And I think when policies restrict supply, it just moves energy production to jurisdictions that likely
have less regulation. And it also moves the jobs and the government revenues and increases the trade
debt. And I'll say the jobs in oil and gas are good paying jobs you can raise a family on.
So in terms of our operations, if some sort of hydraulic fracturing ban was implemented through the rule-
making process, it would not be material to Chevron's upstream operations in California. It impacts future
drilling at a field that represents less than 10% of our production. Of course, we'll work with Governor
Newsom though to make those rules as advance the environmental objectives while continuing to support
the jobs and the economic benefits of our industry.
In terms of any kind of internal combustion engine, there what I'd say is we support the Paris agreement.
We support a price on carbon. Light passenger vehicles represent less than 10% of global greenhouse
gas emissions. So let's make sure we also focus on the other 90%. But if you want to look at to EVs and
transportation, put a price on carbon and let the technologies compete in the marketplace.

Ryan, are you there? Katie?

And we'll take our next question from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Ryan's loss, my gain. A couple of things I'd like to follow-up on more look back and look forward. Gorgon
in the first quarter, we had some fairly significant gas prices. You're typically more contracted than the
spot market. I was just wondering how that performed at a time where you were -- probably weren't able
to participate much in the spot market. I was just curious how you covered the contracted side and how
you think about that a little bit going forward?
And then the other question I had hasn't gotten much play recently, but as part of the curtailments within
OPEC+, how the neutral zone restart is going, what the impacts are there for you?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sure. So on Australia, we've said that with 1 train down at Gorgon, which has been largely the case since
midyear last year, if you think of our Australia system is having 5 trains, and so 4 out of 5 trains have
been operating. That lines up pretty close with our contracts. So it's not an exact match because some
of the Wheatstone contracts and Gorgon contracts are a little bit different. But fundamentally, we're
balanced. So yes, the real opportunity cost from the Gorgon downtime was not participating in the spot
market. So we didn't get the benefit of it, but we're relatively balanced. There were some trading puts and
takes, I would say, in the LNG spot market, but nothing worth pointing out.
In terms of PZ, that ramp up continues very well. It's that 60,000 barrels a day, our share, pre the shut-
in was about 80,000. So we expect to get there here during the course of the year and then, of course,
any OPEC+ curtailments. At this point in time, it's not being curtailed, but that's really subject to the local
governments.
Operator
We'll go next to Manav Gupta with Crédit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I just quickly want to focus on 2 questions on the California project. The first one is because you are
sequestering and storing in California, does that mean that on top of IRS 45Q credits, you also get the
LCFS credits because if you're not storing in California, as I understand, then LCFS is not available. And
the quick follow-up there is, why almond tree? Is it only because the carbon intensity is minus 80? But is
it also because it's just you and one more guy chasing that feedstock, so what we are seeing in the soya
bean oil market, that doesn't replicate. So if you could tell us why almond tree as a feedstock?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Well, let me just step back for a moment. Just remember, we're just talking about transportation.
That's the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions globally, right? The first is manufacturing;
second, power generation; third is agriculture and land use; and then fourth is transportation. So
agriculture and land use is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. You've seen our work in
renewable natural gas, which again captures the methane from dairy cows. And so that's a worthwhile
area for us to look into.
So the agricultural waste is just that, that's what happens is it gets burned, and those emissions go to the
atmosphere. And so partnering with Schlumberger and Microsoft that's a worthwhile project to capture
an emission that otherwise will enter the atmosphere or not or be burnt, emitted to the atmosphere and
converting it and sequestering essentially in generating some excess power.
So it's early days. You're right, it's all policy-enabled, including federal policy and California state policy.
We're doing the front engineering, a lot of work to do, but I think you're getting -- the right idea is that

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
we're looking for projects that are higher return, lower carbon. And so this is a project that we can
generate a return with the policy support and reduces carbon.
Operator
We'll go next to Ryan Todd with Simmons Energy.
Ryan M. Todd
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Sorry about that. I -- my phone -- the call dropped right you asked me a question. Maybe if I could follow-
up on one of the earlier questions in terms of the restarting of the buyback. I mean you walked through
2 of the things that you needed to see, which is sustainable excess cash flow generation and a strong
balance sheet. You mentioned the near term cash goes on to the balance sheet. Is that because it's just
the place to hold the cash while the sustainability gets to a level of confidence that you're okay with? Or is
that because you actually feel like the balance sheet needs to be strengthened a little bit more before you
restart the buyback?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
It's a bit of both. I mean, it's just how the math works, right? If you have excess cash and you don't
change your capital program, the dividend, we just increased, so that's not going to change. So just by
definition, it goes to the balance sheet. And so -- but it also, I think you can infer in my comments that,
again, we're looking to future excess cash generation and the strength of the balance sheet to weather the
commodity price cycle. So I'm not going to give you a hard target. This is -- we're going to use judgment.
Because there's judgment on future excess cash generation. This is our first quarter actually with current
excess cash generation. We expect the next couple of quarters to be potentially even better because
you've got oil prices above $60, refining and chemicals margins much stronger. So it could be even better.
At the same time, we don't have a sustained global economic recovery. So it's reasonable for us to be
cautious. We want to be confident that when we start the program, we're going to continue it for multiple
years and we can sustain it through an oil price cycle. So I know that folks want a formula or a trigger.
I know some of our competitors have those numbers. We're going to use judgment. And we're going to
consider what we see in front of us in terms of the likelihood of future excess cash generation.
We're going to want the balance sheet in a strong enough position that if oil prices cycle down, we can
continue the buyback program, relying on the balance sheet. Our balance sheet is very strong right now.
But yes, in the short term, excess cash is going to go to the balance sheet. That's kind of by definition, but
it also serves the dual purpose of lowering our net debt ratio and putting us in a better position for when
we start if and when we start a buyback program.
Ryan M. Todd
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
And then maybe on a separate topic, if we talk a little bit about refining. I know you don't comment
on these headlines. You have mentioned recently in a news article connecting to a potential refinery
acquisition in the U.S. kind of Northwest. You did acquire refinery in recent years. Can you talk about how
you think about your portfolio exposure on the downstream side in general? Appetite for increasing or
reducing that exposure in any way? And how your general view on the refining outlook over the medium
term may play into how you look at managing your portfolio?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So again, I won't comment specifically on that report. The refinery in the Gulf Coast is a very small
acquisition that we made was something that I had foreshadowed. I was leading the business at that point
in time because we'd only had 1 refinery in the Gulf Coast region. We were, I think, the only company
really, major company with that setup. We did not -- we were on the eastern side of the Gulf Coast in
Mississippi. And so our retail in Texas was supplied by third-party barrels. So we had talked about that.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
We didn't have to do that, but when the opportunity came, and that transaction is kind of working as we
envision.
So on the West Coast, we're at a much different place. We have a 2 refinery system. We have a leading
brand. Really strong infrastructure. We are -- we're growing a little bit in Mexico, some of our retail
volume is there. So I'd just say we're in a strong position on the West Coast. And in the Gulf Coast, we
were also strong, but we felt we could make us even better by getting something on the eastern side and
the Texas side, and we did that. So I wouldn't read too much into it.
We did a small Australia retail fuels, which again was enabled our value chain out of Asia. So there's been
some very targeted modest acquisitions in the refining business and retail business. But for the most part,
you know that we're -- we have a focused geographic footprint, very competitive business.
As we look forward, look, it's going to get better. Winter storm Uri as difficult as that event was for
everybody in the region, one of the outcomes was it tightened inventories for fuels and especially for
chemicals. So those margins have recovered a little more quickly than they otherwise would have. And we
think the next couple of quarters are going to be good, and we're well positioned in our downstream and
chemicals business.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman with Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I guess, following up on the downstream since that's being discussed. Can you just comment on
specifically your markets? You're focused on California and kind of the Asia Pacific region, and it seems
like vaccine deployment and return to normalcy is kind of lagging there. So when you look across your
portfolio, do you see kind of different pace of margin improvement and return to normal? And do you
expect your refining results to reflect that throughout the year?
And then secondly, on the Toyota MoU you announced, there was a comment in the press release
mentioning that the MoU and the pursuit of hydrogen will leverage existing market positions and assets
that Chevron has. Can you maybe elaborate on that comment a bit, what market positions or assets or at
least the types of market positions and assets that the MoU will leverage?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Jason, I'll be real quick on the second one because it's early days. It's an MoU. It's really to explore
this alliance. It's to work together to grow the hydrogen business in passenger vehicles and heavy duty.
You'd expect that the focus would be around California, which makes sense. And the reference to assets is
like hydrogen fuel dispensing at some of our service stations. So that's the comment. More to come. We're
very excited to partner with a great company like Toyota on the fuel cell technology, and you'll hear more
over time.
In terms of the regional differences, you're absolutely right, there are regional differences. If I contrast
first, West Coast and Gulf Coast, Gulf Coast is a little bit stronger. I mean, Florida looks really pretty
much back to normal. West Coast, on track with gasoline and diesel, really has come on strong now. The
Southern California resurgence earlier this winter has worked its way through. The rates are very low and
you're seeing that come back. Domestic travel, strong, again, in the Gulf Coast region, seeing it come
back in California.
What's a little bit weaker we're seeing on the West Coast is because of the big airports in San Francisco
and LA are such -- are so heavy for international travel. That clearly is lagging. Now hopefully, it's coming
soon after domestic travel. We saw the announcement in Europe that fully vaccinated Americans could go
to Europe this summer. So we'll just see that's hopefully not too far behind.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
We saw in China and Australia, the domestic travel fully recovered once those countries got their arms
around the virus. So I'm confident domestic travel will come back very quickly here in this country. But
again, international travel will lag a little bit, and we'll just see.
Asia, Asia is a big -- it varies. Some countries have much better control of virus than others. And then
the excess -- some of the new refining capacity in China becomes relevant there. So the U.S. has
strengthened, for sure, as I said earlier with winter storm Uri and you're seeing that in petrochemicals too.
So I do think second quarter, third quarter are going to look better. It is a global market. So these markets
do stay connected. Asia has also recovered somewhat, and we'll see where the results are over the next
few quarters.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Sam Margolin with Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
So I just have one question, and I want to revisit this reinvestment topic because it seems pretty
influential right now. So as you know, you feed a lot of questions about your organic maintenance capital.
And then anything inorganic is supposed to be accretive to some metric, whatever people choose. But I
think is it fair to say that with Noble, what we're seeing is a flexible strategy to reserve and production
management? If you're generating surplus cash, you're building capacity for inorganic adds to manage
sustainability, and we should think about it as kind of a multifaceted approach instead of this siloed point
of view that people seem to be shoehorning you into. Is that fair?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I think so, Sam, yes. I mean, when we look at just the organic capital, and you say, again, we were $13
billion and some change last year, $14 billion, and we had planned to be at $20 billion each year of pre
COVID. And that you look -- you make that comparison. But to not include the inorganic, seems to not tell
the whole story. And I think you saw that in a lot of the reserve replacements and other numbers and you
saw that in our Investor Day, our ability to basically get pretty close to the same production guidance, 5
years out, this year versus where we were last year, is a reflection of greater capital efficiency, but also
the Noble transaction. Now so that, I agree with you.
Whether we do that again or not, that's a separate question. Again, we don't have to do that. We can
sustain and grow the enterprise. Our sustaining CapEx on the upstream side, excluding exploration, how
we've defined it is about $9 billion. So we are above that. Of course, we are investing in Tengiz, which we
know is going to result in higher production and much stronger higher cash flow. So again, we showed a
free cash flow growing 10% per year. So I do understand all the questions. I think you are hitting it. It's
a little bit focusing on half of the story. We got to look at the whole story. Of course, we're managing the
whole company and again, keeping an eye on long-term value.
Operator
We will take our last question from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
Two things. One, you haven't talked in -- I don't perceive this to be an issue but because based on your
costs, I'm just wondering, are you seeing any concerns, just if you would talk a little bit about OFS
potential in place in both domestic and international? And then same sort of thing around any raw material
shortages and maybe include personnel there.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2021 EARNINGS CALL | APR 30, 2021
Yes. Short answer is nothing at this point in time. Lots of talk about it, but we are not seeing requests
for price increases or that. In terms of inputs, certainly, steel prices are up, so that would flow through to
our wells and the oil tubulars. And we are seeing -- this impacts more the downstream trucker shortages.
And so that -- in terms of personnel, we're seeing that. I think that's in part the Amazon effect and all
the delivery, UPS and the rest, pulling a lot of truckers off. So we think that will work itself out. So those
are pretty minor and targeted in terms of general oilfield services inflation, not seeing it here in the U.S.
or internationally. But we're cognizant oil prices are higher, and we're certainly hearing the talk, just not
seeing it on the ground.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then just lastly on you talked about the new credit carbonization project in California. I'm just
wondering, as you transact and sort of jump into more of those. Is that going to be more sort of return-
based? Or what is sort of driving as you see opportunities in that? I just want -- maybe from a broader
standpoint, if I could ask.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We're very clear that our message and our goal is higher returns, lower carbon. And that's true in
our conventional business, and that's true in M&A and how we walked away from Anadarko and how we
did the Noble transaction, and that's true in energy transition. When you look at hydrogen and carbon
capture, yes, we're viewing those as growth businesses that can do both higher returns and lower carbon.
There are other parts of our energy transition strategy, lowering the carbon from our operations, which I
mentioned earlier, increasing renewable products, all of those also need to generate returns. So we're very
clear what we do in the space has to be good for the environment and good for shareholders. And so far,
we're able to accomplish both, and we think activity will increase going forward.
Operator
That will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr.
Green for any additional or closing remarks.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call and Webcast. Our Chairman
and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. Also listening in today is Roderick
Green, the incoming General Manager of Investor Relations, who will assume his position effective
April 1. Roderick and I will be transitioning together over the next couple of months. It has been my
sincere pleasure working with each of you over the last 3 years. Thank you for your excellent questions,
transparent feedback and investment in Chevron.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Wayne. 2020 was an unprecedented year. The global pandemic resulting in a devastating
loss of life and historic collapse in the global economy and extremely volatile oil markets. We began the
year in a strong position, and we took swift action to adapt to the new realities as they emerged.
During last year's first quarter call, we shared our plan to manage through the crisis, grounded in our
values, and keeping our strategic and financial priorities intact. Looking back, I'm pleased to say that we
delivered on each of these 5 commitments, which I'll cover on the next slides.
First and foremost, we focus on the safety of our employees and our operations. Despite the difficult
personal challenges faced by everyone in our workforce and the additional health safeguards at our
operating facilities, 2020 was our second safest year ever in terms of fatalities and our best ever on
serious injuries, motor vehicle crashes and loss of containment. And it was also the year with the greatest
and most rapid change in market conditions. Our upstream team had to quickly and safely demobilize
dozens of rigs and reduce other production activities. Our refining personnel had to figure out how to
make as little jet fuel as possible even though just weeks before, jet was the fastest-growing refined
product. Despite all this, our upstream delivered more than 3 million barrels per day for only the second
time in the company's history. And our refineries maintained world-class availability to deliver the energy
required for essential workers and a recovering economy. I'm so proud of our employees, how they carried
out the responsibilities with excellence and helped each other, and during this extraordinary year, rose to
overcome the unprecedented challenges.
Turning to capital and cost management. During last year's Investor Day, we told you our capital program
was flexible. In just weeks after we said that, we proved it. 2020 capital was down 35% from 2019.
Inorganic capital, excluding incremental C&E from Noble in the fourth quarter, was under $13 billion, well
below our revised guidance of $14 billion.
We also exceeded our guidance for operating cost savings. Excluding special items, OpEx was down by
over $1 billion this year with decreases due to reduced activity levels and lower transportation, fuel and

incentive compensation costs. This demonstrates our ongoing cost and capital discipline, something you
can count on and a key to winning in this industry.
Moving to the next slide. We entered and exited the 2020 crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet
while also completing a major acquisition. Early in 2020, we increased our dividend over 8%. We also
bought back shares. When the crisis hit and cash from operations decreased, we took action to halt the
buyback and protect our balance sheet. We completed asset sales, received good value and finished our 3-
year high-grading program in the middle of our guidance range.
Being prepared with a strong balance sheet, consistent with an ongoing asset sales program and adaptive
on share repurchases enabled us to increase our annual dividend payout for the 33rd consecutive year.
And the actions we took to preserve long-term value, which I'll cover on the next slide, should give our
shareholders confidence that we intend to sustain and grow the dividend in the future.
Turning to Slide 7. While we reduced short-cycle capital that would bring on near-term production, we
maintained capital for projects that we expect to deliver production and attractive cash flow for years like
our expansion project in Kazakhstan. And in the Permian Basin and other short-cycle basins, we preserved
the capability to build investment backup when the conditions are right.
In addition, we were the first to announce and complete a major acquisition, showing the way with a low
premium equity deal at an opportune time. And as a result, our total investment over 2020 and 2021
will likely be in line with our pre-crisis guidance, but we'll get there in a much different way with much
lower organic capital that would have added more barrels to already oversupplied markets, offset by
an acquisition for low-cost barrels already producing. That also translated to reserve replacement, with
additions from the Noble acquisition mitigating reserve demotions from reduced capital investment and
price effects as disclosed in last year's 10-Qs.
Committed employees, capital and cost discipline, decisive actions that balance the short and long term,
that was our playbook to manage through this crisis. And while we're not out of it yet, we look to the
future with optimism. We believe we're better positioned than others, confident in our ability to succeed in
any environment.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm also proud that we maintained our commitment to ESG, a commitment we've
long held and one that doesn't ebb and flow with market cycles. We increased actions to advance a lower
carbon future, abating emissions in our operations, starting up our first renewable natural gas plant and
investing in low-carbon technologies like our recent announcement with carbon utilization start-up, Blue
Planet. We completed our largest company restructuring in 20 years and integration of Noble employees
in a transparent and equitable manner. And we maintained positive relationships with our suppliers and
supportive relationships with communities where we operate. Lastly, we continued strong governance,
which starts with our exceptional Board of Directors during an unprecedented year to meet the interest of
all our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. We reported a net loss of $700 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings were about
breakeven. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix of this presentation.
Excluding working capital changes, cash flow from operations was almost $4 billion for the quarter. Our
Brent oil cash breakeven price, excluding working capital, was under $50 for the second quarter in a row.
T&E was $3.2 billion, including about $200 million for legacy Noble assets. Full year financial results were
significantly lower due to weak market conditions as reflected by an adjusted ROCE near 0. We remain
committed to improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Investor
Day in March.
Total shareholder distributions, including first quarter buybacks, were $11.4 billion. And we ended the year
with a net debt ratio in the low-20s after the assumption of Noble debt and its step up to market value.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
Turning to Slide 10. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings were down about $200 million compared to third
quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings increased, primarily due to higher volumes from Noble Energy
and higher commodity prices. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased due to negative timing effects,
including an end-of-the-year inventory valuation adjustment of more than $100 million, higher operating
expenses, primarily due to turnarounds, and higher RIN credit prices. The other segment decreased
primarily due to higher pension charges related to lump-sum elections.
Turning to our full year earnings. Adjusted earnings decreased by over $12 billion compared to the prior
year. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily on lower prices. An underlift and the mix effect of
higher U.S. and lower international liftings also lowered earnings.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower volumes and margins, unfavorable timing
effects and higher RIN and other credit prices. The other segment loss increased primarily due to higher
pension expense.
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for 2021, assuming a $50 Brent price. We expect production to
be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any asset sales that may close in 2021. Our
projected growth is driven by a full year of production from the Noble Energy assets and lower expected
curtailments, partially offset by higher base declines, in part, due to lower capital last year, price effects;
an accounting change in Venezuela; 2020 asset sales; and upcoming contract expirations. Note that our
Rokan concession in Indonesia expires in August of this year. And while our contract in Thailand does not
expire until March of next year, production is decreasing due to the short time to earn a return on new
investments.
Now looking ahead, in the first quarter, we expect turnarounds and downtime to reduce production
by 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily in Australia. Gorgon Train 1 repairs are nearing
completion, and we expect the facility to be back online in March. After Train 1 is back online, Train 3 will
be taken out of service for the propane vessel inspections, any repairs and the planned turnaround.
At Wheatstone, production is modestly below capacity while we repair an inlet separator. We do not expect
production impacts in the second quarter.
The impact from ongoing OPEC+ curtailments is estimated to be 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
primarily in Kazakhstan.
At TCO, our project workforce reached 20,000 by year-end before we paused due to a virus resurgence.
Next month, we expect to resume remobilization for the spring campaign and are targeting a project
workforce of 26,000 by the end of the first quarter.
In Indonesia, we expect cost recovery barrels to decrease 75,000 barrels per day from last quarter.
Onetime prefunding for drilling and ARO commitments in the fourth quarter contributed to the working
capital build. We expect these receivables to reverse by the third quarter.
And downstream turnaround activity in the first quarter is expected to have an estimated after-tax
earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. Other financial guidance items are shown on the slide.
With that, back to Mike for his closing comments.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Pierre. 2020 was a year like no other. And while there are uncertainties and challenges
ahead, we're optimistic about the future. We're stronger with Noble, which adds geographic diversity and
plays to our strengths.
We're starting the year with an industry-leading balance sheet again. We're executing a disciplined
investment program that grows enterprise value with greater capital efficiency. We remain committed to
our #1 financial priority: sustaining and growing the dividend. And we're advancing a lower carbon future
with actions that are good for the environment and good for shareholders.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Devin McDermott at Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
The first one I had here was just on the capital allocation strategy as we think about the next 2 years. And
you put the release out back in December, cutting the capital budget over the next several years to $14
billion to $16 billion. And as part of that, noted that as Tengiz spending in Kazakhstan rolls off, you would
increase spending in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico.
And I was wondering if you could comment on the role of those U.S. assets in your portfolio in light of the
current policy and regulatory backdrop, particularly the Gulf of Mexico? How you're thinking about the U.S.
concentrated investment strategy in light of current policies?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Thanks. Thanks, Devin. Look, there's a couple of things that I think are important to recognize.
Number one, not only have we transitioned over the last few years into what I would describe as a
structurally lower ongoing capital program. But number two, it contains a much greater degree of
flexibility. And we mentioned we pulled spending down 35% really over just 9 months last year because
we could flex that downward.
And so we have a great degree of flexibility. We've got a high degree of capital efficiency in our portfolio.
And even at these further reduced levels of spending, as Pierre mentioned, production will be somewhere
between flat and up 3%.
So we've got a capital program that we like. And as the TCO project comes down, we've got room to make
choices. When we issued the press release, certainly, the Permian and the Gulf of Mexico would have been
some of the first places to draw that capital back.
As we look at some of the announcements of this week and developments that seem to be unfolding
here in the U.S., it's early days to understand exactly how these will play out. The executive order was
sweeping and broad, but it also lack some specificity. And I think, certainly, as you listen to some of the
members of the new administration comment, as they introduce this and answered some questions, I
think they're looking to flesh out the details here in the coming weeks and months. And we certainly hope
to be engaged in those conversations.
Onshore in the Permian, we're weighted towards Texas more so than New Mexico. We're weighted toward
private land more so than federal land. So we've got a fair degree of flexibility there, and that remains a
highly attractive place for us to step capital up as we have the capacity to do so and the market conditions
support it.
So I think the Permian equation looks pretty similar to what it did at the time we made those statements.
Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, I think we just have to see how this unfolds. And certainly, we like the projects
that we're advancing here. And there's been, I think, general signaling that existing leases are secure. And
we would presume the permitting that would go with those leases is also likely to proceed, but there are
questions about this that I think we're just going to have to work our way through.
So the risks are probably greater in the Gulf of Mexico. That was probably the lower part of the capital
step-up that we might have envisioned at any rate. So I think we'll be able to manage our way through it.
But stay tuned. We'll keep talking to you about this as we go forward.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
And of course, we've got options outside of the U.S. as well. And I think that's important to just bear in
mind. If conditions in the U.S. become so onerous that it really disincentivizes investment, we've got other
places where we can take those dollars.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on TCO and Kazakhstan. I was
wondering if you could give us just an update on progress there and how things are progressing versus
your expectations?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So quickly, I'll reiterate that last year, we completed all module fabrication and all the transportation
to get the modules through the Russian inland waterway systems through the Caspian unloaded into site.
That's a really important milestone because those were risks that could have extended things had we not
accomplished that.
Progress overall in the project is about 81%. At this point, construction is about 60% complete. And
as Pierre said, we've remobilized 20,000 workers to the project. We've plateaued at that number now
because Tengiz is experiencing some of the same winter time uptick in coronavirus cases as you're seeing
around the world. And so we're holding at 20,000 right now. We've had to quarantine certain portions of
the workforce there for certain periods of time. We plan to restart further mobilization in February, and as
Pierre said, targeting 26,000 by the end of the first quarter.
We'll need to get some progress under our belt here to really see data on productivity. There's a lot of
work that hasn't been done over the last -- going on a year now this has been impacting us. And so we're
working on optimizing schedules and work plans, and understanding what the full impact of that is. It's
hard to quantify that until we really are back at work. And certainly, in the winter time, things tend to
slow down. Summer time, they'll pick up. And so we need to see our ability to sustain the workforce there
to get work done productively and begin to chew into this backlog that has built up. And we'll keep you
advised as to what that looks like.
Jay will be with us at the Investor Day in 6 weeks, and he'll give you more detail at that point in time. I
don't believe, by that point in time, we will have enough activity that we've seen where we'll be able to
give you a highly reliable, specific update on cost and schedule. But we will be working on that, and we
will get it to you when we've got enough data to give you something that we think is really useful.
Operator
We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question, the 2021 production guidance, the high-end growth of 3% is slightly below where
consensus is here. And you gave some color there on Gorgon and Wheatstone for the first quarter,
which was very helpful. So I guess, is it fair to assume that the extent of the downtime at Gorgon and
Wheatstone that's in your guidance is just kind of what's in the first quarter? And just maybe any color on
what you're factoring in for the Permian as well for 2021?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean, first thing I'll say, Phil, and I know everybody looks at production, but it's an outcome. And
we're running the company to deliver financial results, and we let the production be what it is.
Pierre gave you a guide for first quarter on Gorgon and Wheatstone. Wheatstone, for the rest of the year,
should be back up to full capacity until a turnaround that begins late third quarter and runs into fourth,
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
which we'd already planned and announced. And then, of course, at Gorgon, as Pierre mentioned, Train 3
will have inspection of these propane exchangers and a planned turnaround here in the second quarter of
this year.
So we will be lighter on Australia production than we're everything up and running for a full year, but a big
part of that is planned turnaround activity and then there's an increment related to these repairs.
In the Permian, there's 2 pieces to think about. Overall, Permian production will be up because we've
added production from Noble. I think we've previously guided to kind of a 6% to 7% decline on the
Chevron legacy production. That actually, today, looks like it will be a little less steep, maybe more like a
5% decline on Chevron legacy production in 2021 versus 2020. And that's with flat activity levels, running
5 rigs and 1 or 2 completion crews over the course of the year. And a little bit of this will be dependent
upon what NOJV partners do. We ended the year last year with about 1.4 net rigs in the Permian on the
NOJV, 7 gross. Our share, about 1.4. In January, it's up a little bit to about 2.5 net rigs, 10 gross. So
there's a little bit of perhaps upside depending upon what non-operated JV partners do. But those are the
key pieces there on both Australia and the Permian for production.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And Phil, I'll just add that Venezuela year-on-year is down, right? We changed our accounting
midyear last year to where we're no longer booking production and reserves associated with those
operations. We do continue to have curtailments this year, which is also factored in.
Australia year-on-year is not a big variance. It's flat to modestly down. Again, we operated a big portion of
2020 with the train down at Gorgon. So that's not a big driver of the year-on-year change.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Great. That's very helpful. My follow-up would just be just on capital allocation. Balance sheet,
obviously, still looks very strong. Pierre, you said your dividend coverage is below 50 Brent, I think, for a
second straight quarter. And that's despite downstream still being soft. So with oil here in the 50s, I think
some people were maybe a little surprised you didn't increase your dividend the other day, recognizing
we're still in the midst of a pandemic. But just any thoughts you could share around cap allocation if oil
does indeed stay here in the 50s?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well, a couple of things maybe in response to that, Phil. Thanks for recognizing we are still in the
middle of a pandemic. Demand is still off in total. The global economy is functioning at below its capacity,
and I think there's uncertainty out there. And certainly, oil prices today are supported in part by a
unilateral move by Saudi Arabia to take 1 million barrels a day off the market.
And so while we see inventories coming down and things trending back towards balance, that process is
still underway. And so we want to be mindful of the uncertainties in the commodity price environment, and
there could be some downside risk.
So all that said, maybe 2 other points. One, while for the last 3 years, we announced a dividend increase
in the first quarter. If you go further back over the last decade, it was never a first quarter increase;
it actually was in other quarters. And so we don't necessarily have a pattern or a kind of a preference
for when the dividend increase would occur. It's really based on our assessment of both short-term and
long-term conditions, affordability, et cetera. And it's a Board decision, and the Board reviews that every
quarter.
So I hope our words, but more, our actions, over recent years have demonstrated to you and to our
shareholders that the dividend is our #1 priority. We have not changed that. Others have. Others have
made moves and reshuffled priorities and reset dividends and all the rest. We have not, and we were

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
guided through this by those financial priorities. And we're very mindful of what our investors look for, why
they hold our stock. And that's certainly something that will be part of our discussions as we go forward.
Last comment to your hypothesis. If we stay in a $55 Brent world for all of this year, we're in a very strong
position from a cash flow standpoint. Our breakeven is in the 40s. And so we'd be free cash flow positive,
and that certainly is supportive of a dividend increase.
Operator
Next, we'll move to Jeanine Wai at Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
I'd also like to congratulate Wayne, and thanks for putting up for -- with all of us for so many years. So
thanks.
My first question is, again, on shareholder returns. Chevron's prior $19 billion to $22 billion medium-
term CapEx range. I believe that was based on 60 Brent, and it left room for about $5 billion a year of
buybacks. So can you talk about how your updated 2022 to 2025 CapEx guidance, how -- if we should
think that, that range still also leaves room for ratable annual buybacks?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, it'd be a function, Jeanine, primarily commodity price, right? So we've outlined that budget premised
on a lower price than $60 because we've been through this pandemic, and we expect only a gradual
recovery in the global economy, which would support gradual recovery in commodity prices. So we've
prepared ourselves for a difficult set of market conditions, which is certainly what we saw last year. If
-- and as I just mentioned to Phil, we can hold production flat to grow it at these capital levels. And so
we're in a position to consider dividend increases and share buybacks if we see an economic recovery and
commodity price environment that supports that.
The fundamental premise that we outlined at $60 continues to be our premise, which is disciplined
capital spending, a commitment to the dividend and a return of surplus capital above and beyond that
to shareholders premised upon a strong balance sheet and the other things that we always talked
about within our priorities. So we'll lay out a little more detail on this in March for you so that you can
understand what this would look like under different price scenarios and how we might allocate capital or
the flexibility we'd have for capital distributions under different price scenarios. So stay tuned for more
discussion in March.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. I'll stay tuned for that. My second question is on the energy transition. I guess how does the
current extremely low cost of capital for energy transition projects, energy transition companies, how
does that impact your view on the speed of the transition and the potential to create lots of capacity that's
potentially uneconomic but nonetheless, it still erodes oil and gas demand? So I guess, your views on
that? And how can Chevron compete in that type of environment?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So certainly, this is a space that's getting a lot of love from investors right now. And you see it in
EV start-ups. You see it in solar start-ups. You see it in a lot of different technologies. And look, we're
supportive of all of the above. We want to see advancements and growth in renewables. We expect a
lower carbon energy system in the future.
I think you put your finger on one thing that needs to be watched is things that are supported by low
interest rates, lots of investor enthusiasm and government policy may work in the short term. The
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
question is when the tide starts flowing in other direction and when a day comes that interest rates are
up, maybe investor perceptions shift a little bit and maybe government policy shifts a little bit, have we
invested in things that can sustain in that environment? And I think that's -- we hope that they can. And
we want to see the diversification of the energy mix to meet growing demand around the world and lower
carbon.
The last thing I'll say, I'm not sure this necessarily erodes energy demand as fast as some might believe
-- or oil and gas demand as fast as some might believe. A lot of it is going into power that displaces coal.
It, in some cases, creates capacity that is intermittent and can't be used all the time. It actually requires
natural gas to create grid stability and supply reliability. And so there's not necessarily a one-for-one
displacement on all of these investments, and that requires a thoughtful study of the whole energy system
to really understand how it's evolving and how this capacity plays against all the other different sources of
energy.
Operator
And our next question comes from Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Let me congratulate Wayne as well, and appreciate the time and friendship over the years.
Let me kick it off here on downstream. When we think about our model, upstream did okay. Downstream
was a clear miss relative to our projections. And it's not surprising, just given how tough demand was in
the fourth quarter. We are seeing cracks moving in the right direction, with line of sight to OPEC barrels
coming back into the market. Do you guys envision a downstream ahead? And how do you think about
your refining configuration to capture that?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So you're right. Downstream conditions have still been tough. Demand is off. It's off differentially
across different parts of the product barrel, which continues to stress the refining system. And then it's --
the amount that it's off varies quite a bit regionally, right?
So in China, things are back to normal. By and large, other parts of Asia are pretty darn close. Europe,
North America, not so much. So it's a gradually healing system, but it's different in different parts of the
world. And refining markets are regional, and they're interconnected globally, but fundamentally, they
start out regionally.
So we're looking for improvement over the course of this year, but I wouldn't call it a full recovery. I think
it's -- again, it's a gradual process. And we're certainly heavy on the West Coast and heavy in Asia. And so
in Asia, things are, as I said, a little bit better. But on the West Coast, they're still recovering.
So I think downstream in 2021, I would expect it to be better than it was in '20. But we're not anticipating
pre-pandemic downstream earnings and performance this year.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Neil, if I can just give a little more on the fourth quarter. I made a reference to this year-end inventory
adjustment. I'll just explain that. It was more than $100 million.
So during the course of the year, you're costing inventory at average cost of the commodities. At year-
end, you see if you built or drove relative to prior year layers. And so the good news is we drew. We took
our inventory levels down. So good management of working capital. But we drew into prior year layers
that were higher costed.
And so that's only something we do at year-end in the fourth quarter. You're not doing it during the year
because you don't know if you're going to go into prior year layers in the intervening quarters. So you
Copyright © 2021 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
don't want to be always doing this calculation. But our practice is at year-end, we revalue that. So you
have -- think of it as inventory that had been valued at 42 during the course of the year. When we go into
prior year there, is we're picking it up at 60 or 70. There's no cash impact, but there is a onetime kind of
P&L effect.
We don't call it a special item because it happens every year. It just happened this year. Through good
inventory management, we actually drew down into prior year layers, which were higher costed.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
That makes a ton of sense. So the follow-up is, you guys acquired Noble towards the Bangka cycle. Mike,
you've built the reputation as being a good deal maker and being willing to walk away when the bid-
ask goes the wrong way. Just -- do you still see it as a buyer's market out there? And do you still see
attractive opportunities, whether it's U.S. E&P or elsewhere in the portfolio?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So it's still a tough market. And you would say that in general, I would say both companies and the
asset valuations are down from where they've historically been. So there's opportunity in circumstances
like that, and we've got the capacity to consider doing things.
We may have passed the bottom. Hopefully, we have from the standpoint of commodity and other cycles
here. And we're alert to opportunities. It may be that as companies come back in terms of their equity
valuation, there's still a lot of people that are carrying a fair amount of debt and have indicated a desire
to sell assets in order to repair their own balance sheets. So we could see a market where there are more
asset sellers than there are buyers, which could offer some opportunities at an asset level. And so we'll be
aware and alert to those things.
The nice thing is we're not in a position where we have to do anything. We strengthened ourselves
significantly with a very good deal last year. We've got plenty of inventory to work on for many, many
years to come. And anything we would do would have to, A, fit strategically into a strong portfolio; and B,
it would have to compete for capital in a strong portfolio. And so we'll continue to hold the bar very high
and only consider things that would really make a lot of sense.
Operator
We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
First, just want to say thank you to Wayne over the last 3 years for all the help and insight, and wish you
the best in your next role.
Two question, Mike and Pierre. One, I want to go back into the federal leases exposure. Can you share
with us in the Permian over the 2019 and 2020, what percent of your activity is actually in the federal
leases? I understand that federal leases may be only about 10%, 15% of your overall Permian land
position. But want to see that from a activity level, how that looks like.
And also that how many permits that you already in hand in Permian? And whether you have the -- all the
needed permit for your program in Gulf of Mexico this year. Also that if you can just give us the production
number in the fourth quarter in Permian, DJ and Dover?
The second question is on the ESG and the carbon product or service. We understand you are not
interested going into the renewable power like solar and wind. But is there any other new product or
service related to ESG and carbon you think you have the technology that you can build it into a new
business? I'm not sure if that's the process, but it's a new business.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
VP & CFO
Paul, it's Pierre. I'll start with your first question. I think we'll take some of it off-line with Wayne and the
IR team in terms of production from the various basins.
Our federal acreage, as you said, in the Permian, is less than 10%. It went down a little bit through the
Noble acquisition. We're not going to disclose the activity for the last year and how much was the mix. I
think you can find it's publicly available data, and you can chase that down.
In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, I think it's well-known that permits tend to -- you don't -- you have a
lower inventory of permits. So if we have a bigger inventory of permits in the Permian Basin, we and other
operators do, that's not the case in the Gulf of Mexico. So those permits tend to be a lower inventory.
I will just point out that we have one floating rig on a long-term contract in the Gulf of Mexico that expires
at the end of the year. So we'll, again, take your rather detailed questions off-line. And then, Mike, do you
want to answer the energy transition?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I was thinking about the first questions. And so energy transition, if I caught it, Paul, what
technologies are we interested in. I think we've indicated carbon capture and storage, for sure. We
recently made an investment in another carbon storage technology start-up, and you can expect to
continue to hear more from us on that front.
And then, of course, hydrogen should be in our wheelhouse. We manufacture hydrogen today. We've sold
hydrogen before at retail. And we should have the toolkit to take what is technically feasible today, but
not economically practical and look for ways to drive cost down and scale up hydrogen over time. And so I
can't promise you we're going to get that to a point where it's fully competitive with the alternatives today,
but that's an area that a few companies have the capability to do all the things required. And we're one of
the types of companies that should be able to work on that. So those would be 2 areas you can expect to
see us active in.
Operator
We'll go next to Doug Terreson at Evercore ISI.
Douglas Terreson
Mike, Chevron's equity has handily outperformed S&P energy since you became CEO a few years ago. Its
focus or decisiveness, I think as you like to call it, on higher returns on capital and lower debt and lower
dividend breakevens have been a winning formula with energy investors. Simultaneously, the pace of
change in the industry seems to be quickening, not only as it relates to policy, which we talked about a
minute ago, and likely future energy mix, but that which is expected from investments in the sector. So
my question is a couple of fold.
Number one, how do you guys think about how to navigate this evolving environment, which is somewhat
different. Two, are tactical and strategic dexterity likely to be needed maybe more than in the past? And
then finally, what might be the implications for financial strategy in this new environment? Or is it too
early to know?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well, Doug, first of all, I want to congratulate you. Everybody's been throwing bouquets to Wayne. I
know this is the last lap round the track for you this year as well. So congratulations, and best wishes in
the future.
On your question, I think a lot of the fundamentals that we've been exhibiting in our strategy will continue
to serve shareholders well as we go forward. It's the capital and cost discipline. It is the ability to meet
the needs of today's markets while investing for tomorrow's markets. And with the diversified portfolio we

have across business lines and across geographies, we can mitigate market and regulatory risk that may
emerge in one country because we've got a footprint that allows us to shift resources and capital allocation
to other parts of our portfolio.
So for 140-plus years, this is what we've been doing. You're right. Things are evolving now, but they've
been evolving for quite some time. And I think the capabilities we have in our organization, the honest
dialogue we try to have with everybody about how do you meet the growing demand for energy and the
desire to see the mix change and how do we continue to invest where we have advantages in both the
existing core business and the emerging new businesses is what you will see us continue to do.
At the core, I think the financial priorities stay the same. We are committed to the dividend. We're
committed to organic reinvestment in order to support that dividend, and that can be a reinvestment
across the entire spectrum of energy technologies. Maintaining a strong balance sheet. We've seen
this last year how important that is. And then when we've got surplus cash after those first 3 needs to
distribute that back to shareholders. That framework is intact and I don't see that changing.
Douglas Terreson
Okay. And also, good luck to Wayne. For me as well, he's done a great job in this role.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Doug.

We'll move next to Biraj Borkhataria with RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I had a couple. So the first one is just around your comments around generating free cash flow at
prevailing commodity prices. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the balance sheet and where you'd
be comfortable in terms of gearing as you move through 2021? Also, Pierre, maybe you can touch on the
recent announcement from the S&P on potential changes in credit ratings for the sector and risk of the
industry with the transition, and how that is working into your thinking and managing the balance sheet?
And then the second question on a different topic. With Gorgon down in the quarter, presuming that, that's
obviously a decent hit to your LNG portfolio, can you confirm if you were buying spot LNG cargoes in the
fourth quarter? And I just -- if you can give a rough sense of the quantity or the earnings impact on that,
because I guess that's more transitory in nature given some of the issues there.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All right. Thanks, Biraj. It's Pierre. I'll start. Look, Mike just went through our financial priorities, and we're
in a good place on a debt ratio. Our net debt ratio is under 23%. That includes the assumption of debt
from the Noble acquisition, which added about $9 billion of debt.
So I've talked about -- we don't have a target net debt ratio range, but I've talked about a range between
20% and 25% is a good place to be over the cycle. We can be below that at times. We'd be heading up
towards this range. If we're above it for some reason, I'd want to have confidence that we're heading
down that range. So it's not a hard and fast target, but we're in a really good place with a leading balance
sheet, low breakeven, as Mike talked about, and very well positioned. We also have asset sales that we
provided some guidance on here on the call.
In terms of the S&P, look, we work with them. It was an industry-wide call. I think our track record speaks
for itself in terms of being disciplined with capital, protecting the balance sheet and being very progressive
about the future of energy and our approach of higher returns, lower carbon. So I think that lines up with

the rating agencies, but that's not something we control. That will be up to them. We're managing the
company for long-term value, and we think we're doing a good job.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Biraj, your question on Australian LNG, a simple way to think about this is we've got 80% or so of our
volume termed up. And you can think about having a train down for a better part of this, this last quarter.
So 4 out of 5 trains running. So about 80% of our capacity.
So we've been able to satisfy all of our term needs, and we're in the market now with our commercial
organization, buying a cargo here, selling a cargo there in and out of the spot market. But we haven't
been out of position and hurt because we had to buy high and sell low to any meaningful degree through
this whole cycle.
Operator
We'll move next to Doug Leggate at Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Wayne, I want to wish you good luck, and I'm hoping Roderick gets a little earlier in the queue.
Congratulations.
Guys, I wonder if I could just go back to the capital allocation question very quickly, Mike. You've now got
Israel and a lot of growth opportunities that Noble had talked about longer term. And it sounds like you're
backing away a little bit from the need for growth in the Permian. I'm just wondering if under the Biden
administration, is that how we should think about capital allocation international versus domestic, now
you've got bigger opportunity set?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We'll have to see how things play out in the U.S. I don't want to overreact to that at this point in time until
we know more. But fundamentally, we intend to continue to be very disciplined in the allocation of capital.
Noble's assets in Israel have the big part of their capital spend behind them. Right now, there's capacity to
grow production there with little or no incremental capital right now. And the nice thing is we bring some
capabilities to bear here that might not have been in Noble's wheelhouse.
So there's ways to take this gas further into regional markets. There's ways to take it into LNG, be it
facilities that have [indiscernible] today that you go into or Noble had been looking at an FLNG concept.
There are ways to take it to power markets and to power generation and then regional power distribution
across borders. And there are opportunities to look at things like hydrogen and new energy technologies
as well.
So we have the financial strength and capacity to underwrite things larger than perhaps Noble could
have. And some technical capability and relationship depth in some of these markets that should be an
advantage. And so we'll look to use those to support the growth of the position in Israel.
And then the broad capital allocation question, U.S. versus other countries, we're always thinking about
that, always looking at that and drawn by returns and risk. And we'll continue to evaluate those things.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Securities, Research Division
Okay. I appreciate that. My follow-up is maybe for Pierre. It's a follow-up to the S&P question earlier,
whoever, whichever one of you guys would like to answer this. But it's really more about the external
pressures that you're seeing, whether it be from one of your large peers seeing a shareholder talking
about big energy, European investment community and obviously, your European peers moving in that

direction, and now you've got the credit agencies. And it seems to me at least that the U.S. side of the
pond is still very much in the big oil category in terms of how you see your opportunity set going forward.
I'm just curious, Mike or Pierre how do you see these external pressures influencing discussions with the
Board, discussions with investors, and ultimately, the longer-term energy mix? Will we see Chevron move
towards that big energy story over time?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, I'm going to come back -- I think Pierre mentioned earlier that we describe our strategy with 4
simple words: it's higher returns and lower carbon. And both of those things matter to the investors that
we speak to. And we're working hard on both fronts, and we've got to improve return on capital and
demonstrate that we're going to do that.
And at the same time, we also have to prepare for a lower carbon energy system in the future. And we're
reducing the intensity of the energy we deliver today and making really good progress on that. And we'll
continue to set new targets in that area because the world -- stepping on the hose of supply, through one
way or another, doesn't really change demand. And so somehow demand will need to be met. And we
think it should be met by those that can do it in a way that has the lowest carbon impact.
We're increasing the production of renewable and lower carbon products for our customers, so they can
reduce their energy intensity and carbon intensity. And then likewise, looking at these breakthrough
technologies, and I mentioned a couple of them earlier.
So every company in the industry, Doug, is searching for the right mix. There's not an empirically
observable correct answer to this. And I think we're all working with our various stakeholders, right? Our
Boards, our employees, our customers, the countries where we operate and the policy that we operate
under, to manage both of these things.
And look, energy is the lifeblood of the global economy. And reliable, affordable energy will be
fundamental to the recovery from the pandemic in the short term. And in the longer term, it will be
fundamental to lifting people out of poverty around the world, and we have to remember that.
And today's energy system is not the enemy. Lower emissions are what we should be focused on. And
that's what we, as a company, are focused on. And that's what we talk to our stakeholders about, and
that's what we're committed to doing.

We'll go next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Sankey Research LLC
Mike, just ask 3 questions. You've obviously addressed your strategy on the call, but I just wondered,
in the light of activism that we're seeing, what -- are there any specific requests, if you like, or strategy
pushes that you're getting from shareholders? I wondered if you could just update us on what you've been
hearing and perhaps where you're sympathetic to the ideas that are being pushed towards you and maybe
where you're pushing back?
And then I had a follow-up just on the decline rates. You've said that you've got higher decline rates on
lower spending in '21. Having said that, the number is only 70,000 barrels a day or about a 2% decline.
Can you just help me understand why that number's so low?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul. So on strategy push from shareholders, there's not a lot that's being said in shareholder
discussions that I haven't discussed here. It's what is your strategy for a lower-carbon world? And what do
you see yourself having unique strengths?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
And if there's one thing I do hear back from people, it is support for not going into things where we
wouldn't have competitive differentiation, and we may pursue lower return investments just for the sake
of saying we're doing it when there's others out there that can do it just as well. So beyond that, I'm not
hearing a lot of strategy push from shareholders. I'll let Pierre take the question on declines.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And just add to Mike's comments. I mean, this is a sector that is trying to regain favor with investors.
And it hasn't earned its cost of capital. And the way out of that isn't by investing more capital. So being
disciplined in our conventional business with capital, being disciplined in M&A, and being disciplined with
the energy transition. As Jeanine asked, renewable energy products operate in commodity markets that
have cycles up and down just like conventional products do.
In terms of our decline, yes, Paul, I'm not sure. What I meant to say is that you'll see declines this year
resulting from our capital last year because we did take capital down. But as you rightly point out, the
decline, and we tried to put that on the best apples-to-apples basis, so again, we've got curtailment
adjusted and then asset sales or contract expirations adjusted, which is a good view of our base and our
shale and tight. And so it's a little more than a 2% decline.
It is a big change because that would have been growth previously because you would have had Permian
growing. That's how -- that was part of the reallocation. Mike showed a chart that said we are likely to
invest $40 billion over the last year and this year, but $13 billion of it was Noble. So no doubt, our organic
portfolio is not growing like it would have been previously because we've taken some capital out.
But as you point out, it's a modest decline. It's because we're facility constrained in a lot of places. We
have long-lived assets like in Australia LNG and Tengiz and offshore and even the declines in what's
considered high-decline areas like the Permian, we were able to mitigate. And Mike said earlier that our
Permian production is beating our guidance range, and we'll actually be up because of the Noble barrels
that we added 2021 versus 2020 full year and if you adjust for curtailment. So it's a good story that we're
able to be so efficient and mitigate declines. And I'm happy you picked up on that number.
Operator
We'll move next to Dan Boyd at Mizuho Securities.
Daniel Jon Boyd
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
One, I would just say thanks for sticking to your guns and only doing things where you have a competitive
advantage. It makes clear business sense. Most things have been asked. I just have one for Pierre.
Just on the FX, which has been a headwind to earnings this year, can you talk about the cash impact that,
that has, if any? And how you see that potentially playing out in 2021?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, the vast majority of it is noncash. I mean, it's balance sheet translation, so it's taking your monetary
accounts, asset accounts and liability accounts and revaluing it. What we've seen is during the course of
the year that all was strengthened initially, and then we saw it weakening relative to other currencies, in
particular, like in Australia, Canada, some of the others where we'll have like a deferred tax liability that
gets revalued. So it turns into cash over time. But it depends on what the exchange rate is at that time in
the future.
So you have modest amounts that happen in the quarter, but the vast majority is reflecting a full
revaluation of that liability -- monetary liability or monetary asset account. And what -- how it ultimately
settles will decide if those gains or losses are realized or not in cash flow.

We'll go next to Manav Gupta at Crédit Suisse.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
I just want to ask one question. You are absolutely leading the charge on RNG, and some of the projects
that you are actually developing in RNG have a CI of like minus 150 to minus 200. That's significantly
lower than any EV can actually produce at this point of time. Yet we -- all we see out there is the
demand for EVs, and states saying they only want to run on EVs and car manufacturers saying they only
want to make EVs. So is there something that Chevron and the industry groups can do to educate the
governments or the markets that there are other forms of lower carbon like RNG, which actually have a
much significantly lower carbon intensity than an actual EV?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Manav, I'm impressed. You've done your homework on carbon intensity. And not many have to your -- the
foundation of your question.
Look, our RNG is very good from a carbon standpoint because you mitigate otherwise unmitigated
methane emissions, and that's why it gets the very attractive CI factor.
The CI factor has to be worth something. And because RNG, from a first cost basis, is more expensive
than fossil natural gas. And so in markets where there's a policy framework that creates that financial
connection to the low CI, it's attractive and economic. And that's where we're playing today. I would
expect over time that those policy frameworks could expand for the reasons that underlie your question.
And we are working with customers as well to help incentivize the adoption of CNG vehicles.
We've got an initiative in California, where we'll subsidize truck owners to convert or buy new heavy-
duty CNG engines in return for a supply agreement. And then we're working with a number of different
distribution points to enable that to happen.
So we think this is a good part of the mix. It's not the answer everywhere, but it is certainly a part of the
mix that we think deserves to grow. And that's why we've been investing into it. And it ties to the earlier
comments about doing things where we've got unique and competitive advantages.
Operator
We'll move next to Jon Rigby at UBS.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Two questions actually. One is on when you think about the portfolio and also what you've seen in the
market through the sort of '15 -- '14, '15 volatility, the volatility you've seen now, are you starting to
change the way you look at the investments that you're making going forward? So are you looking at
hurdle rates, payback periods, et cetera, and changing them to sort of tailor a different environment going
forward? And also, I mean, if you are, are you able to do that through the portfolio? Or can you also do
that through the way you approach the development of an asset? So you build it with the expectation of
adding satellites longer term or you build a bigger host, et cetera? That's the first question.
The second, which is slightly tied to that, it seems to me also and you've demonstrated it, but low gearing,
a low level of indebtedness, has served you very well to those 2 cycles. So when you think about the sort
of 3 shock absorbers that you have, so short-cycle investments, balance sheet and buybacks, is, in the
near term, the priority getting debt down?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All right. Thanks, Jon. Look, I'll get started. I think the answer to your first question is yes, and no. No,
we're not changing how we look at investments. We don't have to go to ancient history books to know that

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
the top line in our business is volatile. We've had not just '14, '15, you go '08, '09, you go late '90s. And
so to have companies in our industry that don't have balance sheets that are built for something that we
know occurs with some frequency is a capital structure that doesn't make a lot of sense. It transfers too
much risk to equity holders, and that's partly reflected why the energy sector has underperformed other
sectors for a while. So in that sense, I don't think we think of it differently.
But to the second part of your first question, can we do developments differently? Absolutely. Can we size
them to keep them full longer offshore? I mean, I think Mike has talked about the capital efficiency of our
shale and tight, the flexibility of it. So undoubtedly, our capital efficiency is better than it ever has been.
I mean, our ability to generate positive free cash flow from a dollar capital invested. We've talked about
being very disciplined with our capital, which reinforces it.
But the basic premise of operating in a set of commodity businesses that are volatile, that hasn't changed
in the last several years. That's been the case for the 30 years I've been with the company.
And as you said, I think your second part of the question, how we operate with our 4 financial priorities
is it reflects that reality. And so we understand what business we're in and then what kind of capital
structure we should have that's in the interest of our shareholders.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Right. But to that point is even with an advantaged balance sheet that you have against your peers, I
think that's why they acknowledge. Would it be fair to say that the first priority of those sort of 3 variable
things, accepting that the dividend is a structural thing, is probably balance sheet?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, again, our 4 priorities, Mike went through. It's dividend; reinvestment, because we got to generate
cash for the dividend; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and buybacks is fourth. And so we're always
going to maintain a strong balance sheet. I gave kind of a range that we think is a good place to be over
the cycle. And again, we can be below it, heading towards it or above it.
So the balance sheet is, it's right in the middle of the range I've been talking about since I've been CFO.
So there's no primary need on balance sheet. I mean, what's more -- the bigger driver is we're not at
a full economic recovery here. And so getting control of the pandemic, getting the world's economies is
growing again on a sustained path, that will be good for our business.
Our breakeven is under 50. You can do the math. If oil prices are above 50 and if downstream margins
improve, because that's a breakeven under 50, including pretty weak downstream margins, we'll have
excess cash. And we'll look at our priorities and make decisions like we have in the past.
Just as a reminder, we bought back shares 13 of the last 17 years. We bought back shares on average
during that time period basically equivalent to the daily average. So we're pretty consistent returner of
cash to shareholders in the form of sustaining growing dividends and share buybacks when we had excess
cash.
Operator
We'll take our final question from Ryan Todd at Simmons Energy.
Ryan M. Todd
Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division
Great. I'll just -- maybe a couple of quick ones at the end. On disposals, moving forward, I mean with the
downsized capital program, should we expect a relatively downsized disposal program on a run rate basis?
And if so, is there a range in terms of what we should think of in terms of annual disposals?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 29, 2021
And then maybe as a follow-up question, as we think about your 2021 production guidance, the contract
expirations in Indonesia and Thailand, can you confirm what the volume impact is there? And any
willingness to share what the potential cash flow impact of those volumes would be at $50 oil?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. I'll take the asset sale question. I'll let Pierre handle contracts. Yes, Ryan, first thing is we don't
need to conduct asset sales to generate cash. Other companies might be in a different position.
But look, we've closed out the program we announced previously. We're not announcing a new program.
Pierre guided to $2 billion to $3 billion for '21. And if you look back over the last 2 decades, we've been
kind of plus or minus a couple of billion dollars a year in normal portfolio maintenance and kind of rotation.
And so I think that's the kind of a number you ought to think about for your model.
And like I said, this coming year, we might be a little bit to the upside of that. There'll be some years we'd
be below that. But look, we're doing this to high-grade and strengthen our portfolio, not to generate cash.
Pierre, I'll let you take the contracts question.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Ryan. I mean, we've disclosed in our supplement tables that we provide each quarter production by
country. You see it in our 10-K. So I think it's pretty transparent with production in Indonesia and Thailand
is -- not all of Thailand is part of the concessions that are expiring here early next year.
We don't disclose cash flow by country. I mean, there's a fair amount of disclosure in our oil and gas tables
that you can look back for there.
So we'll continue to provide what we think is meaningful guidance each quarter as we go forward. We
showed the variance that was tied to contract expiration. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are there
for you. And of course, if you have follow-up questions, please reach out to Wayne and Roderick.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of
Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Audra. Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and Webcast. I'm Wayne
Borduin, General Manager of Investor Relations. And on the call with me today are Mark Nelson, EVP
of Downstream and Chemicals; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are available on
Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statements on Slide 2. Now I'll turn it over to
Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Wayne. Third quarter earnings were about breakeven, improved from last quarter of reflecting
continued challenging market conditions. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the
appendix to this presentation. Special items totaled $220 million, including a tax charge related to a
settlement agreement on asset retirement funding and other items tied to the expiration next August of
the Rokan production sharing contract in Indonesia. Free cash flow was almost $2 billion, and the dividend
was flat with last quarter. Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow from operations improved as commodity prices
increased from their lows in the second quarter. Included this quarter was a $265 million cash payment
related to the Rokan settlement agreement. Our cash flow dividend breakeven was under $50 Brent due to
improved downstream performance and our strong capital and operating cost management. We ended the
quarter with a net debt ratio over 17%, well below our competitors.
Even after closing the Noble acquisition, and stepping up its step to fair value, we expect to maintain the
leading balance sheet among the peer group. We're committed to protecting our financial strength during
this ongoing crisis.
Turning to the next slide. Our 2020 capital spending is trending below our latest guidance. Looking ahead,
we expect next year's capital budget to be $14 billion, below the combined 2020 guidance from Chevron
and Noble, and well below Chevron's 5-year guidance from our March Investor Day. Our 2021 capital
budget will continue to prioritize investments that drive long-term value, and shows the capital flexibility
in our portfolio, including assets recently added from Noble. We'll share additional details in December
after formal approval.
Operating expenditures in the quarter were more than 10% lower than our 2019 quarterly average, ahead
of our guidance. Turning to Slide 6. Relative to the same period last year, third quarter adjusted upstream
earnings decreased due to lower realizations and reduced liftings primarily due to curtailments, partially
offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Adjusted downstream earnings decreased primarily
due to lower sales volumes and margins. The other segment was higher primarily due to various corporate
charges.
Turning to Slide 7. Compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings increased by about $8 billion.
More than half due to the absence of second quarter special items. Adjusted upstream earnings were up
almost $2 billion, primarily due to higher liquids realizations. Adjusted downstream earnings increased
by over $1 billion primarily due to higher sales volumes and margins and favorable swings in both timing

effects and lower cost or market inventory adjustments at CPChem. The other segment charges decreased
primarily due to a favorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation.
Turning to production. Third quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was 3% lower than
a year ago. During the past 12 months, we closed a number of asset sales all signed pre-pandemic.
Increased Permian production and higher entitlement effects were offset primarily by curtailments and
higher turnarounds. The curtailments were in line with our guidance range and reflect mostly OPEC+
reductions in Kazakhstan and Africa and market-driven constraints in Thailand.
Now I'll turn it over to Mark.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Thanks, Pierre. As shown on Slide 9, the operating environment has improved from the lows in the second
quarter, but is still challenged. Some products like diesel and petrochemicals have been more resilient
during the pandemic, and we've been able to develop new customer channels. Conversely, jet demand
has only modestly recovered. Its up demand picture has resulted in weak product margins, well below
cyclical averages. Since the crisis started, we've been focused on what we can control: safe and reliable
operations, cost management and value chain optimization. In the third quarter, our financial results
improved due to strong performance in these areas, along with some margin improvement in polyethylene
and West Coast fuels.
Turning to the next slide. Our focus on cost management is delivering results with third quarter operating
expenses nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter. I'm proud of how our employees
have risen to this challenge. Streamlining work processes, reducing contractor costs and adapting activity
levels to a lower margin environment. Our teams have also delivered on more than 90% of the planned
scope of our 2020 turnaround program. Deferring only a minor amount of activity. This is a tremendous
accomplishment and positions our refinery network to be ready without a backlog when the economy is
back to pre-pandemic levels. Optimization activities further reduced the cost of this year's planned work,
contributing to lower operating expenses.
Turning to the next slide. As always, we're focused on safe and reliable operations, keeping our employees
safe, being a good neighbor and delivering the products of the world are all part of our license to operate.
Since the economic slowdown began, we've balanced efficient refinery utilization with the highest margin
sales channels for our products. We've consistently placed more than 90% of our high-value products into
our contracted sales channels despite volatility in demand. This generates the best margins across our
value chains. The recent acquisitions of marketing assets in Australia, in the Pasadena refinery and the
U.S. Gulf Coast further extend our value chains in those regions giving us more opportunities to improve
profitability and returns.
Turning to chemicals. GS Caltex continues to make good progress on their new mixed feed cracker.
We expect the project to be under budget and months ahead of schedule. Our local team has done a
remarkable job safely progressing the project despite the challenges of COVID-19. At CPChem, we've
completed feed at our U.S. Gulf Coast Cracker 2 project and have placed it on hold as we assess market
conditions. We continue to believe in the long-term fundamentals of chemicals, and the importance of
world-scale facilities with access to low-cost feedstock. At the same time, any new investment needs to be
supported by project economics that will generate strong returns through the price cycle. Also, CPChem
began producing circular polyethylene at scale, an industry first in the United States. The production of PE
from plastic waste is an important milestone and underscores our commitment to finding innovative ways
to deliver sustainable products to our customers.
Now turning to renewable fuels. The future of energy is lower carbon and we're delivering more alternative
products to our customers. Recently, we announced first gas at our CalBio renewable natural gas joint
venture in California and a new partnership with Brightmark. Our capital committed to RNG ventures
is over $200 million. In renewable diesel, we're leveraging existing infrastructure to co-process biofeed
at our El Segundo refinery, with start-up expected in the first half of next year. Also, we sell a range of
branded biodiesels and are piloting the sale of R99 in Southern California.

Through Novvi, we recently announced first production of renewable base oil at our 500-barrel-a-day plant
in Texas. This leading technology partnership has developed an innovative and sustainable product with
future expansion potential. And lastly, our GS Caltex hydrogen testing site in South Korea has opened,
the first of its kind in Seoul, where customers can purchase traditional fuels as well as hydrogen and
electricity. All of these efforts align with how we're increasing renewables in support of our business, part
of our approach to the energy transition, which Pierre will now further discuss.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mark. We continue to make good progress in our energy transition focus areas. Next year, we
expect to fund $100 million of projects identified with our marginal abatement cost curves. The map
tool helps us select the most cost-efficient projects to reduce carbon intensity across our operations. As
Mark noted, we announced the new joint venture with Bright Mark, extending our renewable natural gas
portfolio.
Finally, in our partnership with Svante, we're pleased to have been awarded a U.S. DoE grant to help
fund the construction of a demonstration carbon capture plant in our California upstream operations.
The project is expected to start-up in 2022. These projects reflect Chevron's commitment to low-carbon
solutions that are both good for the environment and good for our shareholders.
Turning to the next slide. We closed the Noble Energy acquisition earlier this month, and integration is on
track. We've completed employee selections, had some early quick wins like paying off the revolver and
selling its plain, and assessment of operational opportunities is well on its way. In the third quarter, Noble
generated positive free cash flow, primarily due to ongoing capital and cost management and strong sales
in the Eastern Med. We're pleased to add Noble assets and welcome its talented employees to Chevron.
Our internal transformation launched late last year is mostly complete with a new organization in place
November 1. This was an enterprise-wide change effort, the largest since our Texaco merger, that
modernizes how we work, leveraging digital tools and empowered teams. Lastly, we recently signed an
agreement to sell our Appalachia natural gas business. We expect to close the transaction before the end
of the year.
Now looking forward, in the fourth quarter, we expect Noble production to be lower, primarily due
to seasonal demands in the Eastern Med. Curtailments and planned downtime are both lower than
last quarter. Production this quarter may include additional cost recovery barrels related to the Rokan
settlement. At Gorgon, Train 2 weld repairs are now complete, and we have started commissioning in
preparation for LNG production. We expect Train 1 to be taken out of service after Train 2 is back online.
At TCO, remobilization continues. We successfully increased the project workforce to near 15,000, and our
plans are to end the year with a project team over 20,000. Earlier this week, we completed our final sea
lift on schedule. All modules are now in Kazakhstan, a significant project milestone. And finally, we expect
severance payments to lower cash flow.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
I have one upstream question here and one downstream question. Maybe, Mark, i.e., sort on the
downstream question, which is it looked like the downstream results, and particularly refining, surprised
relative to our expectations. Was there anything that you would call out here in the third quarter as many
of the independent refiners had very tough third quarters, including on the West Coast. And just can you
step back and talk about your big picture outlook for the refining sector in that part of your business.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Thanks for the question, Neil. First, if I step back and look operationally at the third quarter performance
overall, I would say that operationally, it was first driven by our continued cost management efforts across
the downstream chemicals portfolio, much of which is actually focused in our manufacturing sector. Also
some polyethylene in the West Coast fuels margin improvement. And then contribution from our lubricants
and additives business.
If I step back and look at the refining sector, in general, I would say that the pre -- the pandemic demand
shock, clearly, has retested margin lows, and there's not a real analog for the pace of recovery. But the 3
things are required, I think, to have sustainable improved refining margins.
First, demand recovery for all high-value products in our materials. We've certainly indicated that as an
industry, we're within 5% to 10% of 2019 more gasoline/diesel levels. But jet is still only half of 2019,
and so we need continued recovery there. Second, we need inventory reduction, and we're beginning to
see some of that in different parts of the world. And finally, refinery rationalization. This is the part that's
interesting for us because we've rationalized our portfolio over the past decade and we're now seeing
competitors start to do that. In some of the regions of the world like Southeast Asia, Australia and the
U.S. Coast, you're hearing people talk about rationalization, which certainly creates an opportunity for us
going forward as the supply and demand balance tightens a bit over time. Thanks for the question, Neil.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
And then, Pierre, follow-ups for you. It's on Gorgon. Where do we stand with Train 2? And what do we
know about Train 1 and 3 in terms of managing the downtime there?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Neil. As I said, the weld repairs are complete. We verified them with nondestructive testing.
We've also completed pressure testing of the kettle. So we're now in the process of getting back online. So
we've started the recommissioning process from the turnaround and the extended turnaround.
The next steps are to dry out the systems, and then we'll begin cool down. We expect this to take several
weeks, which will put first LNG production in the second half of November. In terms of train one, as I said,
we expect that to be taken down soon after Train 2 is back online. And then we would inspect Train 1, and
depending on whether repairs are required or not, that will determine how long Train 1 is down. And then
sequentially, then we would look to Train 3 after that one.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
My first question is on sustaining CapEx and the second one is on the upstream with Eastern Med.
So the second half 2020 CapEx run rate, that's below your multiyear sustaining upstream capital estimate
of $10 billion. You've accomplished a lot this year with cost reductions and efficiency improvements. So
my first question is whether there's an update to that $10 billion in sustaining capital number that you
provided a few quarters ago. And I know we've got Noble in the mix now, too.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jeanine. No, there isn't. I mean the $10 billion is really an estimate, right? It's based on our --
again, Chevron only, how to sustain production in the short term. Noble gave out an equivalent number,
around $800 million for that.
To be clear, we're not trying to sustain short term production. Mark just talked about we're in an economy
that's impacted by the pandemic and demand for our products is below normal levels in pre-pandemic
levels, and therefore, we have oversupplied markets. We are trying to sustain the long-term value of the
enterprise. So if you look to our 2021 capital guidance of $14 billion, it includes an upstream capital of
more -- around $11 billion or so, so higher than the sustaining level, but not all of it is going to short-term
production. Some of it is going to long-term production like our project at Tengiz.
So we're focused on sustaining long-term value, not short-term production. That's true in combination
with Noble. But there's no real update to those numbers. Efficiency improvements are rolling through,
but this is an estimate, an analytical estimate that's not so precise that we're going to be updating it
frequently.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. Understood. My second question is on the Eastern Med. Could you provide any initial
indications or thoughts on how you expect to monetize Leviathan and a lot of the other discovered
resource in the area. I guess, specifically, do you think that regional demand growth could be strong
enough in the medium-term or longer-term to avoid either greenfield LNGs or a pipeline to Europe?
And then if I could squeeze one more in there, if there's any commentary on the headlines on the pricing
dynamics, that would be helpful.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All right. Well, I won't comment on some of the headlines you've read. Those are commercial matters that
we'll discuss in private with our partners and with our customers. We've had a very smooth transition with
our operations in Eastern Med and all across the Noble assets. Our integration is on track. The employee
selection in the United States have already happened. We feel really good. We're pleased with the people
who are joining us in the Eastern Med included. So Noble employees are top quality, and we're very
pleased to be welcoming them to Chevron.
As you know, it's a good resource. It's free cash flow positive. The project has been completed. It's in
an area where there's demand opportunities, in particular, backing out coal. But it's only been a few
weeks. So our focus right now is to have a smooth integration with Noble. We're pleased, again, with
the operations and the free cash flow generation. We're going to work with potential customers, existing
customers, future customers to find the most cost-efficient way to develop that resource. There is upside
to it. And again, there's market, but that will -- we'll determine that all in time. Thanks, Jeanine.

We'll move next to Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question here, if I look at the third quarter, it looks like your Brent-based breakeven price,
somewhere in the order of $50 a barrel. And you're talking about this restructuring plan that's been
underway and kind of completing here. So I was just curious how you think about the cost side of the
equation and the ability to further lower the operating costs and the breakeven moving forward given
you've given us the capital number here already.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We -- the breakeven, and again, we would have it a little bit below $50. It's important that it
doesn't factor in downstream margins or chemical margins in other parts of our business which Mark has
addressed. And those can vary, and they can make a difference, obviously, on where the breakeven is.
I mean, margins in that sector are pretty low, and as they recover, that lowers our breakeven because,
again, it's holding. It's just looking at the oil price and not all the other assumptions.
In terms of cost, look, our costs were down more than 10% this quarter. We provided guidance that we
expect to end the year on a Chevron-only basis here because fourth quarter will have Noble operating
expenses. But if you just looked at Chevron only, we would be down $1 billion. Again, we'd characterize
that as activity related and other actions that we've taken to manage through the pandemic and the crisis
that we're in. We've also provided guidance, and we've completed our transformation. So we launched
that transformation, which is an enterprise-wide restructuring. We started that almost 12 months ago, and
we just are completing our employee selections right now. It's a tough time for our employees as they're
being notified and we'll have the new organization in place November 1. We've talked about $1 billion of
OpEx reductions from the transformation. And then finally, we have the Noble synergies. And we've talked
about $300 million of total Noble synergies, not all of that is operating expense.
So all of that is rolling through. We'll bring that together for you, likely at our Investor Day on any kind
of updated guidance. But it's all consistent with your question, which is we're working hard to get our
breakeven down. We sustained our dividend. So the comparisons are consistent. And we continue to make
progress, both through capital discipline and cost management to lower our breakeven, preserve our
balance sheet strength, right, ending the quarter with the leading balance sheet in the industry, a net debt
ratio of 17%. That's essentially what we're doing, and we'll continue to do it as we're in these challenging
times.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Great. My second question would just be as it relates to 2021 production. Obviously, you gave us a
CapEx number here. On the last call, you talked about the Permian potentially declining high single-digit
rate year-over-year in '21 on an organic basis. Obviously, you're layering in Noble here. So I didn't know if
maybe you could provide any early read on '21 production, whether it's stand-alone or pro forma, or if not
a hard number, maybe some moving pieces around it?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We'll provide our production guidance. As we normally do. That will be on our fourth quarter call at
the end of January. We did provide guidance for the fourth quarter, so we do a quarter ahead.
I think you've hit some of the pieces there. Again, I would add the Rokan PSC expiration, which I referred
to, and we had a settlement agreement. It was a really good agreement that assures the certainty around
the funding for abandonment and adds a little drilling activity to keep production managed heading into
that contract expiration. But that's going to be in August of 2021, so I'd point that out. And again, our
efforts in the Permian, which I talked about is a potential decline of 6% to 7% if we stay at those activity
levels.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
So I don't really have more to say, Phil, to you. We'll provide that guidance when we finalize our plans, get
formal approval on our capital budget and we'll do it at our regular time during the fourth quarter earnings
call.
Operator
Next we'll move to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So the first one I wanted to ask on is actually around some of the latest investments and momentum
you've made on emissions reductions. And there's been some positive announcements here over the
last few months. And I think the disclosure on this marginal abatement cost curve is interesting in that
it shows there's opportunities to potentially reduce emissions while also boosting returns of the negative
cost of carbon that you have there. The question specifically, I think about over the next few years
here, any sense of the depth of opportunities where you can actually have this nice win-win of driving
down costs while also reducing carbon intensity. And then as you think about planning longer term, any
intentions of expanding your emission production goals that already exists perhaps through the post 2023
in line with Paris [ climate ], like some of your peers have done, and just how you're thinking about that
longer term.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sure. On the second question, as you said, we have 4 carbon intensity reduction metrics. They go out to
2023. 2023 was chosen because that's the first stock take date under the Paris agreements. And so we're
aligned with those. We're the only company -- first company, only company in our sector to do it on an
equity basis. Many do it on an operatorship basis. And then we do oil and gas metrics separately because
they serve a different market. So the $100 million that you're referring to is something that we expect will
be recurring. So we see opportunities for a number of years to be able to invest that kind of expenditure
and achieve what we would call cost-efficient carbon reductions.
But if I -- and yes, will we extend at some point in time? I think, yes. The answer is yes. It would be
logical for us to go to the next Paris stock take date. But we're right now focused on delivering on those
2023 targets. We also have those as part of the incentive pay of almost every Chevron employee. So we're
making good progress on that.
But I would think all of our energy transition activities, and Mark referred to a number in his business,
they really support making our business more sustainable in the lower carbon future, and they do
it in a way where we earn returns. So the renewable natural gas that Mark was talking about also
generates returns. And then, of course, then we're looking at some of the new technologies, and those,
obviously, are at a different stage of maturity. So we're taking a number of actions that we believe address
climate change that lowers carbon and does it in a way that's good for the environment and good for our
shareholders.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then my second question is just on the portfolio composition post
the Noble transaction. So you recently executed on the Appalachia sale, and you've done a good job under
kind of pruning the portfolio and divesting noncore assets over time. As we kind of look forward here
post this transaction, any updated thoughts on further opportunities for divestitures and whether or not
-- or I guess part of the question, if you could address things like Noble Midstream or anything within
Noble portfolio that might be noncore? And then lastly, whether or not as part of the Noble transaction,
guaranteeing Noble's outstanding data is part of what your vision.
Pierre R. Breber

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Okay, Devin. I got the asset sales. What was the question about Noble debt at the end?
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Whether or not that will be guaranteed by Chevron.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All right. Well, let me just address Noble debt. We're reviewing options. We haven't made a decision. And
again, we'll notify bondholders when we make that decision, and you should expect that in the next couple
of months.
In terms of asset sales. We're on track to complete the program that we've talked about. It was 2018
to 2020, a 3-year program of $5 billion to $10 billion before tax proceeds. We expect to close our U.S.
natural gas sale here before year-end. And when we complete that, we'll be right in the middle of that
range.
In terms of what else is in the public domain, the most significant ownership interest that we've talked
about is selling our interest in Northwest Shelf and that's a commercial matter, and we just -- we won't
comment on.
But I guess I would just say we're in a different place than many of our competitors, right? Mark referred
to the rationalization we've done on our refining network over the last decade and even before. I referred
to a number of asset sales that we've completed in the last 12 months. You saw that in our production
chart, all that are signed pre pandemic at good values. Obviously, we just bought a bunch of assets -- a
company that comes with high-quality assets, and I won't comment on any specific assets in the Noble
portfolio.
So we're very value-driven. The gas assets that we have that we're planning to close here before the
year-end and in our interest in North West Shelf, it held up better in this post-pandemic world. Also, if
you think of North West Shelf, it's more -- almost like an infrastructure investment as the resource behind
the plant comes down and it becomes more of a tolling facility going forward. So you'll continue to see us
to be disciplined in how we manage our portfolio. Would not expect us to have any kind of big program
announcement. We'll have the ongoing portfolio rationalization that's been part of the Chevron approach
to management for a long time.
Operator
We'll go next to Paul Cheng of Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
2 questions. I think one is for Mark and one is for Pierre. Pierre, what would be a reasonable allocation of
future capital in the new renewable, low carbon initiative? And two, let's assume that at some point, you
probably will set up a target to be net carbon zero on at least [ script ] 1 or 2, maybe over the next 15,
20 years. Do you need other new business by some of your peers go into the renewable power business in
order to achieve that. So that's the first question.
The second question is for Mark. If I look at over the last couple of quarters, one of the big performance
difference between you guys and the U.S. comparing to your customers in Europe, they have far stronger
downstream results, mainly because of their marketing assets and also their trading operation. On that
basis, that do you think for Chevron, that is the right recipe so that you may want to further boost your
marketing asset. I mean, you've been selling down your marketing asset over the past 10-plus years. And
for trading, historically, you guys look at the facilitation cost center, while your European peers are looking
at the profit center [ to trade ] around the asset. So is that the right approach for you, or that you don't
think it's right fit for you?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Okay. Paul, I'll start then. Look, we're going to be disciplined with our capital. That's true in our
conventional business, and you've seen that with the announcement of our organic capital budget. That's
true in our acquisitions. You saw that when we walked away from Anadarko, and collected the $1 billion
termination fee. And I think you've seen that in how we executed the Noble transaction being the first
to announce and complete that, an acquisition. And it's going to be true in energy transition. No one in
Chevron has an open checkbook. And that's -- again, that's true in our conventional business. That's true
in our [ main ], and that's true in energy transition.
What you have seen is investments now that are on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars. We
talked about $100 million into our marginal abatement cost curve investments, $200 million in renewable
natural gas. So the investments really are limited by what we believe are -- or reflect what we believe
are the opportunities that are, again, good for the environment, address climate change and good for our
shareholders. In terms of do we need to adopt this change in strategy, I think we've been pretty clear that
we're not going to diversify away or divest from our core business. The actions we're taking around the
energy transition are geared to making these businesses that are good businesses. That play an important
role in society and making them more sustainable in a lower carbon future. So I think you should expect
us to continue to do that. We are going to operate in businesses where we have competitive advantage,
where we have a value proposition for shareholders that is advantaged relative to other alternatives. And
again, we're going to do that in a way that is part of a lower carbon future. So maybe we'll go to Mark on
the downstream question.
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Thanks for the question, Paul. On the marketing question, we've consistently indicated that we are
interested in strengthening our value chains. In fact, you could say that here in the third quarter that
we've demonstrated the benefit of linking our refinery production to higher-margin product placement,
and that's kind of our view of a value chain. And I could -- I would suggest that the recent Puma
transaction is an example of us strengthening value chain in Asia, where we have essentially added
terminals in the retail stations in Australia, where we can now place our Asian joint venture refinery
production in a very strong market where we own the strongest brand. And we acquired that on June 30
and first 3 months and it's working just as we would have expected. So I think that goes to the concept of
strengthening our value chain.
To your comment on the trading portion of our portfolio. Our trading business is designed first to ensure
that we flow product. Second, that we optimize around those value chains and then we trade in those
areas where we have demonstrated considerable expertise and it's vital to our downstream business.
They're critical partners in regard to how we run our business and make those value chains work. And
they continue to look for opportunities to increase their impact. So I appreciate the question because the
way we think about our value chain is important to us.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'll just add, I think our shareholders support our approach to trading because I think they understand
the added risk and volatility that can come with trading earnings, and it generally attracts a little multiple
because of that, in particular in a resource company. Paul, thanks for your questions. We appreciate it.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Mark, maybe I could take advantage of you being on the call. I just wonder if you could offer some
perspectives on how you see the -- this bottoming process of the downstream cycle playing out, what
signposts are you seeing in any of your markets in terms of any green ships or any expectations that
we're going to be here for a while. And I guess what's behind my question is, is Chevron totally done with
rationalization in your downstream portfolio?
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Well, Doug, I think it's a thoughtful question given a unique situation we're in. If I go back to the question
Neil asked about -- it relates to margins, in general. I mentioned 3 things that we have to see to feel
like we are on a path for greater sustainable margins in the downstream business. And it is that demand
recovery for all high-value products. And you can see some of those things happening in our Asian
markets where we see Australia past its 2019 levels. We see certain Southeast Asian markets going
beyond their levels. And with our strong brand, we've been able to go past industry rates of growth in
some of our areas. So I think those are opportunities that will help us on the demand side of the equation.
The inventory reduction, I think the industry has demonstrated over time that we'll work through that,
but that will take a little bit of time. And finally, as I mentioned earlier, the refinery rationalization as an
industry, while we've done the predominance of our rationalization, we're always looking at strengthening
the value chains in which we've chosen to compete. And we'll continue to look at that over time.
But the green shoot, I would say, is the amount of companies that are announcing suggested
rationalizations. And I think if those come through, we might see getting to those recovered margins
sooner than maybe we would naturally expect. We will presume that. We will stay focused on the self-
help side of the equation, things that we can control like lowering our operating costs, certainly running
efficiently with the desired yields and then using data analytics to place and price our products. So we'll
focus on what we can control, but we're hoping that some of those green shoots actually come to fruition.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
My follow-up is for Pierre, if I may. Pierre, just some clarification on the CapEx. What's the cash CapEx
number unrelated given the headcount reduction and so on you've had. What should we think as apples-
to-apples operating cost reductions as we look at '21 versus '20? And I'll leave it there.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So again, we'll give all the details on our capital program when it's formally approved. But a cash
equivalent, excluding affiliates, of about $10 billion is a good number to use right now. Well, I'm not sure
I can say much more on OpEx. I think Devin asked that question. Again, we have $1 billion of reductions
we've seen this year, $1 billion that we'll see next year through transformation, Noble synergies. And as I
said, we'll put that all together and provide some guidance here in the first quarter.

We'll take our next question from Paul Sankey at Sankey Research. .
Paul Sankey
Can you hear me?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
You've talked about your industry-leading balance sheet, and we've seen some incredible deterioration
in values around the various other oils even globally. In terms of acquisitions, I assume that you're now
very happy with your Permian position. It feels as if it's difficult to find anything that would improve your
position. Can you talk a little bit about that? And I assume that you don't want to add debt without there
being a compelling opportunity, which I assume that kind of isn't globally. It just seems that you're in such
a strong competitive position. I wonder if you're thinking about actually doing some more deals.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Paul. Look, we're focused on integrating Noble successfully, and we're off to a really good start.
I also talked about our transformation, again, it's enterprise-wide restructuring that we've been working
on for almost a year now and will go in effect November 1. And so those are really our priorities. As we've
said, we have a high bar for M&A., and Noble cleared that bar. And so it's quality assets -- it meets our
criteria of quality assets at a good value at the right time. I'm just not going to speculate about future
M&A.
If I do talk about our financial priorities, I mean, I think we've been pretty consistent and clear on what
they are. Sustain and grow the dividend. We've done that for 33 straight years. Invest to support long-
term value, and we're doing that in our organic program. And of course, we've done that through our
Noble acquisition. And maintain a strong balance sheet, which we've been able to do with a net debt
ratio of 17.5%. In terms of the Permian, I think you said it very well. We have a leading position. Noble
provides a nice bolt-on. Again, our M&A is not focused necessarily on the Permian. It's focused on assets
that are accretive to our shareholders and a good value for our shareholders that add quality assets.
Thanks, Paul. Do you have a follow-up?
Paul Sankey
I do, actually, yes. It's a totally different subject. Could you talk about your OPEC curtailments? And
anything you can add on the neutral zone?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. In terms of the neutral zone, the production was about 30,000 barrels a day, our share in the third
quarter. So that startup is going well. In terms of our curtailments overall, the guidance we provided was
about 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, so that's oil and gas equivalent. And the majority of that is OPEC+
related. So 80% or 90% of that is OPEC+ related. And that's, again, in countries like Kazakhstan, Nigeria
and Angola. Thanks, Paul.
Paul Sankey
Just quickly -- where are you headed on neutral zone? Just quickly. Where will that go to?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
We haven't provided any guidance. We're focused on continually having a safe and gradual ramp up. So
again, we're at near 30,000 barrels a day, Chevron share, and we'll update you at year-end.
Operator
Next from Biraj Borkhataria at RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
First one I had was on -- just a clarification on TCO. The co-lending figure has gone down for the last
couple of successive quarters. Is it safe to assume, given you've had issues mobilizing the workforce, that
the bit that's missing from 2020 just gets pushed to 2021? That would be my first question.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So there's 2 parts to that. I mean, let me just address. TCO project spending is about down $1 billion
our share this year relative to what we had planned, in part due to the demobilization. But we said about
half of that are through true cost efficiency savings, about half will be deferred to next year and future
years. That's sort of related to the lending, but not entirely right because lending is also dependent on
dividend policy and prices. But you're correct that you've seen that the lending has come down, our
guidance on it has come down during the course of the year, which is again, a combination of lower
project spending. But also where prices have gone.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Got it. Makes sense. And then second question on a slightly different topic. But when you're looking at
project sanctions, and just in the context of your kind of energy transition approach. Do you currently
assume a carbon price even where countries themselves do not have a sort of fiscal framework in place?
And if so, can you kind of tell us what the carbon price you're using is?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. We don't disclose our price forecast for oil and gas prices. We think it's commercially sensitive. We
don't disclose our carbon price forecast. We look at it under a variety of scenarios, both commodity prices
and carbon pricing. And we look at it by jurisdiction because it can vary.
The investments that Mark referred to, certainly are policy supported. So they generate, in some cases,
low carbon fuel credits or renewable fuel standard, the federal standard. And so again, it really varies by
jurisdiction. We are looking at returns. Again, we're trying to make investments in energy transition that
are both good for the environment and good for shareholders. And some of that return is policy enabled,
but it really does vary by jurisdiction. Thanks, Biraj.
Operator
We'll go next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just 2 questions I have for you. The first, I know you said all the modules are in Kazakhstan now, but any
more update you can provide like how many people are actually able to muster to the site and kind of
thought process as we head into the typically slower winter season for what this might imply for budgetary
and time frame of start-up on the next phases?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Roger. Look, the remobilization is going well. I said we're near 15,000 workforce on the
project and we're heading to end the year above 20. So far, our safeguards are working well. We've kept
the rate of infection very low, and we're seeing our work progress in line with expectations. So the key for
us going forward to holding cost and schedule is to complete the remobilization, sustain a full workforce
during a pandemic using our safeguards, and achieve our progress milestones. So we're -- as you say,
we're in the -- I wouldn't say, early days. We're in the middle of the remobilization. We're heading into
winter. We need to see how this all progresses, and we'll know more by our Investor Day, and we plan to
provide an update then. Having all material and modules on the ground is a really important milestone. It
does mean that we now can just address all of the work in place. And so that's -- those are really the keys
for us going forward in terms of, again, maintaining cost and schedule.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Okay. Great. And then a quick unrelated follow-up, if I could. As you look across your various operations,
leave Noble out of this, but everybody's kind of spinning, everybody's kind of drilling. Just curious if
you see anything in the way of decline rates that are either better or worse than what you would have
anticipated, thinking whether it's Permian or Gulf of Mexico or just international?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Short answer is no. We're not seeing any surprises. I mean, the Permian is a little bit higher than our early
guidance, if you recall, at our market response press release, I think it was March 24 or 25, we guided to
the exit rate on the Permian being down 20%. We'll be a little bit better than that. So our production in
the Permian was 565,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We think our exit rate -- this is Chevron only. We think
our exit rate will be around 550. And again, that's a little better than we had guided to back in March. Now
we'll have the Noble Permian production on top of that, that's about $50 million. So we expect to be near
$600 million.
So we're managing -- again, I -- we are managing declines very well. We are not putting a lot of capital to
add short-term production because of oversupplied markets. But we're pleased with how we're operating
the upstream, just like Mark has talked about safe and reliable operations, we're seeing the same on our
upstream operations. Thanks, Roger.
Operator
We'll move next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
My question is about your renewable gas business. If you look at the California Air Resource Board, carbon
intensity scores, actually when I first saw it, I thought it was a mistake because renewable gas is like a
negative 400 or something totally off the charts. I guess you're constrained by the CNG market, which I
don't know how big it is, but given the emissions benefits of this product, are you able to offset all or at
least a significant amount of your obligations from the refining business under the LCFS.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sam, this is Mark. Thank you for the question and the kind of the recognition of why we would be
considering the renewable natural gas as part of our value chain. I mean, you should expect us to be a
strong player in the RNG space and policy enabled markets like the West. It is -- as you've indicated, it is
the most cost and carbon efficient fuel from an LCFs and RFS perspective and it's actually low execution
risk. And so it leverages our strengths, our ability to partner with folks, especially on the feedstock side.
And then our ability to place the product, we've got to your second element that you need a place to put
this over time. And so we're excited about the CalBio and the Brightmark and even the adoptive port
announcements that we've made, and I think you'll see us continue to wisely grow here. Thanks for the
question, Sam.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Oh, sure. Okay. And I mean, I guess, just it's a related follow-up. But one of the things that you've said
that I think is differentiated from a corporate level is that you manage your capital planning not really on
the basis of prices, but on how you see the demand outlook shaking out or directionally because the price
can change and it might not necessarily reflect actual conditions.
But -- so in light of that, you mentioned that we're transitioning to a low-carbon world, some things could
change depending on the election, but can this renewable gas business, if there really is market share to
be had, can it scale beyond California? What other geographic footprints are out there for you? And just
basically, just in terms of scope, what are you thinking here?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Yes. The short answer is growth is clearly plausible. We tend to look at this in regard to our existing value
chains where we have our strengths and where we can execute well, and we'll consider growth in that
context. But there's certainly upside potential.
Operator
Next, we'll go to Manav Gupta at Crédit Suisse. .
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
You have 2 high-class refining assets in California, and we saw that the earnings were stronger in the
downstream, as Neil pointed out. The governor over there is indicating that he wants to ban the internal
combustion engine in 2035, the sale of new vehicles. Is that any way changing the way you plan your
business in California? Or you think that he does not have the legal authority as many legal experts are
pointing out?
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Well, thanks for the -- thank you for the question. I'm actually a native Californian. When I think about
California, I think of, generally, under normal conditions, a very strong economy and a tremendous desire
for affordable mobility. And with that backdrop for the foreseeable future, to be successful in California
from a fuels perspective, I think you have to have reliable refineries. A strong brand both to place the
product and to keep a connection with the customer, and an ability to participate in California's lower
carbon future. And we've been here in California for over 100 years. And I think we are well positioned
to engage with the government to build a path towards the lower carbon future, and we will actively
participate in that and believe we can do so.
Manav Gupta
Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division
Okay. A quick follow-up is you have had Noble assets for about a month. Are there any upside surprises,
thoughts like synergies you think you can do better on? Any integration you think you can do better on
since you acquired those assets?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Manav. Look, it's going very well. Again, we're pleased to have been the first to announce a
transaction and to complete it. It's a good fit, and I won't go through all that. Again, a very successful first
month.
Synergies are on track. We expect that there will be more as we operate as one company. In the first few
weeks, we've been able, for example, to see contracts and look at procurement opportunities. We're also
starting to see operational synergies. We'll update you sometime in the first quarter. Just let us -- give us
some time to fully assess the opportunities. We expect the synergy number to be higher. I don't have a
number for you now. We're going to do that work, and we'll advise you in due course.
Operator
I'll take our next question from Jason Gabelman at Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to circle back to this marginal abatement cost curve, which seems like a useful framework to
use moving forward. 2 kind of related questions on it. One, does this enable you to kind of get to net

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2020 EARNINGS CALL | OCT 30, 2020
0 by 2030? It seems like your European peers are pushing towards that, and I'm assuming the U.S. is
going to ultimately face pressure to hit net 0 on its own emissions by 2030. And do you have any sense
of what you'd be able -- what you need to spend to achieve that now that you have this kind of cost curve
model? And does Algonquin -- the partnership with Algonquin, how does that kind of figure into this? I
think you've been partnered with them for a couple of quarters. Just wondering if that unlocks some of the
opportunities within the goal of reducing carbon intensity?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Jason, look, we support the Paris agreement. And as Mark says, we're going to be part of the lower
carbon energy future. Our focus is on results, not pledges. And so what you're seeing our actions today
that are addressing carbon intensity. I'm just not going to get further. We have our 2023 carbon intensity
metrics I referred to earlier, that we're likely to update those in time to get to the next stock take period.
But our approach, again, is really focused on delivering results that we think address climate change and
are good for the environment.
In terms of Algonquin, it's early days, but yes, we see opportunities there. That does both, right? It sort of
increases renewables in support of our business. You've seen us do that in the Permian and in Bakersfield
with wind and solar projects that are providing power to our operations that we otherwise were buying off
the grid. And Algonquin is working on opportunities in other areas of Chevron operations. This does take
a little bit of time. You got to do some of the engineering work and the development work. But so far, that
joint venture is going well.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Great. And just a clarification. I appreciate -- on Slide 9, you included downstream earnings, excluding
timing effects, which is definitely useful. Is that a disclosure you plan on including going forward? And is
3Q '20, does it imply kind of no timing effects this quarter, just looking at where the graph, where the bar
is on the graph.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Jason. So in the very -- the last slide of the appendix, you see that we actually give the absolute
timing effects for U.S. and international downstream. So for a long time, we've been showing the variance.
But as you said, you could figure out the absolutes in each quarter. So now we've shown that for -- going
back to 2017. And yes, you should expect us to continue to do that going forward.
Operator
We'll go next to Pavel Molchanov at Raymond James.
Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division
You do not have a massive footprint in Europe compared to just about all the other super majors. But I am
curious, your thoughts, another regulatory issue, the European Climate Law, getting ready to be passed 5
weeks from now and what the impact on your upstream and/or downstream operations might be.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, as you say, Pavel, although we've operated in Europe upstream and downstream for many decades,
and I worked there in Aberdeen when the first carbon tax was enacted, we sold the majority of our
upstream operations we have a little non-op position still. And again, no large-scale refining or marketing.
We do have some lubricants and additives businesses in there. So I think, again, we support the Paris
accord. We believe the future of energy is lower carbon. We expect more policy. I think it gets to what

Mark was trying to -- was addressing, to gain the balance between those worthwhile policy goals and
providing affordable, reliable energy that the world economies need.
Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division
Just a quick follow-up since we're a week ahead of the election. Can you remind us, on the combined
Chevron plus Noble Permian acreage position, how much of the acreage is federal?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, it's about 10% is federal in terms of total Permian acreage.
Operator
We'll go next to Neal Dingmann at Truist Securities.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.
I was hoping -- just you've talked a lot about these details on the renewables, but my question was more
particularly on the Novvi partnership. I'm just wondering again on that, out of the zero part facility, can
you talk about maybe some details on what industries you all might target once that starts rolling out of
that facility?
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
Well, so the concept for Novvi for our downstream business is to provide a renewable base oil to round
out our base oil offering over our own business and for the business of others. The product itself, which
is a technology partnership between ourselves, leveraging our isodewaxing technology and some other
patented solutions, allows us to create -- to take multiple types of bio feedstocks and turn them into what
I would consider higher-performing base oils. There are other applications even in cosmetics and things
like that, that will be investigated over time, but we do see an opportunity for expansion at that joint
venture should be economics continue to warrant it. Thank you. Thanks for the question.
Neal David Dingmann
Truist Securities, Inc.
Sure. And then one maybe just quick follow-up on that was you certainly are doing a great job of
continuing to move not only in Novvi, this CalBio gas and just continue to move in the renewables in
general. Do you all have sort of any target or where kind of metrics on where you would like to be as far
as what you think renewables might be as a part of your potential total part of your business, 2 or 3 years
from now? Or is it just too early to determine that?
Mark A. Nelson
Executive Vice President of Downstream & Chemicals
I'll give a first answer, and then maybe Pierre can build on this. I think it's too early for us to say about
how big it could become, but we do intend to continue to grow it as part of our business, and I think
we can do that successfully while we return -- while we improve returns as well. Pierre, would you add
anything?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. That's just well said. Again, I think I addressed earlier, no one has an open checkbook in Chevron to
spend money. That's true in the conventional business and acquisitions and energy transition. We're going
to pursue the opportunities that's good for the environment, good for our shareholders, and that will grow
over time.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Audra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead, sir.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Audra, and welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On
the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides
that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Wayne.
Second quarter was a challenging one for the company. Financial results included $4.9 billion in special
item net charges and a foreign exchange loss of over $400 million. Excluding special items and FX, the
quarter resulted in a $3 billion loss or $1.59 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be
found in the appendix of this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was about $100 million and total capital spending was $3.3 billion, including
about $300 million for the Puma Energy (Australia) acquisition. Asset sale proceeds for the quarter were
about $1.5 billion related to the sale of our Azerbaijan and Colombia upstream businesses. Our dividend
was flat with the prior quarter, and we maintained a strong balance sheet.
Turning to Slide 4. In the second quarter, we recorded over $5 billion in impairments and other noncash
charges. The charges were triggered by the uncertain operating environment and outlook in Venezuela,
a lower oil and gas price forecast due to the anticipated economic impacts of COVID-19 and severance
accruals resulting from our transformation initiative. While we are disappointed by the impairment in
Venezuela, we intend to maintain a presence in the country and resume normal operations one day.
The price-related impairments were primarily related to Stampede, a non-operated field in the Gulf of
Mexico; conventional operations in the Permian; and various producing assets in Asia and Africa. These
charges were partially offset by a gain on asset sales and various tax items.
Turning to Slide 5. We remain on track to meet our revised guidance for 2020 capital and operating
cost reductions. Organic CapEx in the second quarter was $3 billion, already at a run rate 40% below
the original budget. Full year capital guidance remains unchanged at $14 billion as we will need to see
sustained economic recovery and much lower inventories before considering raising activity levels.
Operating costs are also trending lower, in line with our expectation of $1 billion savings compared
to 2019. Organizational design from our transformation efforts is complete. Employee selections are
underway, and we expect to be operating under our new model in the fourth quarter, delivering additional
run rate savings next year.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
Turning to the next slide. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're on track to grow the dividend
for the 33rd straight year. Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was low due to the market
environment. This was partially offset by lower cash CapEx and asset sale proceeds. Higher debt this
quarter included our successful bond issuance in May. Our balance sheet remains strong with a net debt
ratio below 17%, well ahead of our competitors.
Turning to Slide 7. Second quarter earnings were lower due to a swing of over $6 billion in special items
and FX versus the same period last quarter. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased primarily due to lower
prices, including greater differentials to benchmark crudes due to market volatility and reduced liftings
volumes primarily due to curtailments and prior upstream asset sales. Adjusted downstream earnings
decreased primarily due to lower sales volumes to match decreased demand and unfavorable timing
effects.
Turning to Slide 8. Compared to the first quarter, second quarter adjusted earnings decreased by over
$5 billion. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased by about $3 billion primarily due to lower liquids
realizations, lower sales volumes mainly due to curtailments and an unfavorable swing in timing effects.
Adjusted downstream earnings decreased by almost $2 billion primarily due to an unfavorable swing in
timing effects, lower margins and lower sales volumes. Chevron's refinery system ran reliably during the
quarter, with crude utilization well below capacity due to lower demand. The other segment decreased
primarily due to an unfavorable swing in accruals for stock-based compensation.
I'll now pass it over to Jay.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre.
On Slide 9, second quarter oil equivalent production, excluding asset sales, was flat compared to a year
ago. During the quarter, increased Permian shale and tight production and higher entitlement effects were
offset primarily by curtailments and turnarounds. The curtailments were at the low end of our guidance
range as prices recovered from historic lows late in the quarter.
I'm really proud that our employees have kept our upstream operations running safely and reliably during
this global pandemic. With all of the challenges of moving people and equipment and of course, personal
concerns at home, our employees have risen to the occasion to deliver the energy needed in recovering
economies.
Turning to the Permian. We're making disciplined choices to balance short-term cash flow while preserving
long-term value. In response to the current market conditions, we quickly reduced our flexible capital
program across the portfolio and in the Permian, expect quarterly capital spend in the second half of the
year to be about 75% lower than the first quarter.
As of July, we've reduced our operated rig count to 4 with one completion crew. Although the level of
activity in the Permian has rapidly changed, our focus on efficiency has not. By the end of this year, we
expect to double the lateral feet drilled per rig compared to 2018. With lower capital investments and our
improving efficiency, we still expect to be free cash flow positive this year at strip pricing.
As shown on Slide 11, the short-term outlook for Permian production has changed as a result of the lower
capital spending. After curtailments in May and June, we're back to full production and expect second half
production to be in line with the first half. At current activity levels, we expect production to decline about
6% to 7% in 2021. Early next year, we'll update 2021 production guidance for the Permian and the rest of
Chevron's upstream portfolio.
As stated in our first quarter 10-Q, we expect lower capital spending to result in the demotion of proved
undeveloped reserves, primarily in the Permian. These barrels may be rebooked as proved reserves when
funding and activity levels increase. The near-term production profile for the Permian has changed, but
our long-term view of the asset's attractiveness has not. With our scale, efficient factory drilling and
royalty advantage, we believe we're well positioned to maximize returns and deliver value.

Turning to TCO. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, we continue to make progress with our
Future Growth-Wellhead Pressure Management Project at Tengiz, and the project is now 79% complete.
All site fabrication is complete and all modules have now departed Korea. Our logistics system is working
well, and we expect to receive all the remaining modules in Tengiz this year. The remaining project scope
is primarily the construction and commissioning work in Tengiz. We made excellent progress on site
construction through the end of last year and the first quarter of this year. In the second quarter, as a
result of the COVID pandemic, we reduced our construction workforce to 20% of plan. As a result, overall
construction progress has been impacted due to the limited construction workforce. Let's turn to the next
slide.
TCO is working hard to mitigate the risk from the pandemic by closely coordinating with health experts
and regulatory agencies to implement safeguards that protect our workforce. Looking ahead to the second
half of 2020, the project team is focused on remobilizing the Tengiz construction workforce and completing
the final sealift. A return to work planned for about 20,000 FGP construction personnel is set to begin in
August, and we will continue as conditions allow.
Critical path activities such as the delivery and installation of the first 2 pressure boost compressor
modules remain on track. Foundations and access roads are complete, and the team is preparing to
receive, restack and install these modules. With the high field productivity and progress over the winter,
we were ahead of schedule but now have limited schedule float remaining. Our ability to complete the
remobilization and sustain the construction workforce through the pandemic is key to limiting further
impacts to the project. We're focused on safely progressing the project, and we expect to be able to
provide more specific updates to project cost and schedule early next year.
Now I'll give it back to Pierre. Thanks.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jay.
Slide 14 highlights some recent announcements. On July 1, we safely started up production in the
Partitioned Zone and completed the first export this week. Also, we closed the acquisition of Puma Energy
(Australia). These assets will integrate with our refining and marketing value chain in Asia Pacific and
extend the valued Caltex brand in the region. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement with Algonquin,
a leader in renewable power generation, to co-develop renewable power projects that will support our
operations. Initial project assessments will be focused on the Permian, Argentina, Kazakhstan and
Australia.
Turning to the next slide. Last week, we announced we had reached an agreement to acquire Noble
Energy. As the necessary regulatory and approval steps progress, we've also launched our integration
planning efforts. Representatives from both companies are meeting today to kick off the planning
discussion, and we look forward to integrating Noble's complementary assets, people and capabilities into
Chevron. Looking ahead, we anticipate a straightforward and fast integration. Our internal transformation
efforts should help us efficiently integrate the new organization and achieve our synergy targets.
Now looking forward on Slide 16. In the third quarter, we expect production curtailments of about 150,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day primarily due to the OPEC+ agreement. Planned turnarounds, primarily
in Australia, the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, are expected to impact production by about 110,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day. This includes an extension of the turnaround at Gorgon until early September. In
Australia, we expect LNG contract pricing to be lower due to the 3- to 6-month lag with oil prices. Based
on our current outlook, full year net production is expected to be roughly flat with 2019, including the
effects of curtailment. And TCO co-lending is expected to be about $2 billion for the year. In downstream,
turnaround activity is estimated to have an after-tax earnings impact of $100 million to $200 million. We
expect our other segment earnings and distributions less affiliate income to be in line with prior guidance,
excluding the impact of this quarter's special items.

Turning to our last slide. With health, economic and social crises all happening at the same time, this
was a challenging quarter for Chevron and its stakeholders and a reminder of the importance of the S in
ESG. We're proud of the work we're doing with social investments in our communities, pay equity for our
employees and our supply chain spend with women and minority-owned businesses. You can read about
this and more in our sustainability report, which was published in the second quarter.
So with concerns for the health of our loved ones, economic uncertainty in our communities and
expectations for racial justice and equal opportunity, we know that there's more work to do. On the right
of the slide is the company's 5-point action plan in response to current market conditions. We're proud of
how our employees are executing this plan and delivering on what we can control. We entered this crisis
in a better place than our competitors, and we intend to exit stronger and more valuable for all of our
stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

Thanks, Pierre. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. [Operator

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Phil Gresh at JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question is just kind of tying together the commentary in the Permian for next year being down 6%
to 7% with your CapEx commentary that you've provided, which I think in the past you've said $3 billion
quarterly run rate for second half CapEx on a C&E basis, not on a cash CapEx basis. So is the Permian
commentary consistent with just keeping that CapEx at that type of run rate in the second half of the
year?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So we had an approved budget of $20 billion. When we announced our market response plan and
then updated it at our earnings call, we reduced the full year to $14 billion average, but a run rate of $12
billion essentially for the second half of the year. We achieved that a quarter early. So if you back out
the Puma Energy (Australia) acquisition, we were at $3 billion already in the second quarter. And that's
obviously at that $12 billion annual run rate, which is a 40% reduction. And embedded in that are the
reductions that Jay referred to in the Permian and operating at the current 4 rigs and one completion
crew.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Got it. So you keep it at that level in 2021 for a 6% to 7% decline?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, yes, I'm sorry. So yes, we haven't given capital guidance for 2021. We're in the middle of our
planning process. We'll do our normal disclosure and sharing of what our capital budget is for 2021 in
December when we've completed our plan and the Board has approved the plan.
What we are showing is just an outlook based on current activity level. We, early on, guided to Permian
production being about 20% lower on the exit rate relative to our Investor Day guidance. And actually,
we're doing a bit better than that. So that would have taken us down a little bit lower than what you're
seeing on that chart.
And then executing this plan and staying at this activity level, yes, we project that kind of guidance. We're
not giving production guidance. There's a lot of time between now and then. We're just sort of showing
what the outlook looks like if activity levels stay at the same level. It will depend on what the economic
recovery is, what inventory levels, a number of factors will determine what our activity level will be in the
Permian going forward.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JPMorgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Got it. My second question just would be on Gorgon. There have been some media reports out there
talking about some operational hiccups on Train 2 and getting that restarted. I think you were planning in
mid-July. It sounds like maybe it's early September at this point. But could you just elaborate on what's
happening there? What the root cause of this delay is? And what it would mean for being able to meet
contractual obligations? I think you're about 80% contracted at Gorgon, but just any color there would be
helpful.

James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. Phil, I'll take that one. So our fundamental concern is operating safely and reliably. And we're always
going to take decisions in alignment with that. As part of our normal operations, we take trains down for
turnarounds to do inspections and maintenance. And during the Train 2 turnaround, what we found in the
Train 2 propane heat exchangers or kettle, some call them, we saw some weld defects. So we developed a
repair procedure, and they're progressing well on those repairs. We expect them to be fully accomplished
here in the near term, and we expect to have the train up and running in early September.
All the other planned work for the turnaround has already been completed. So the focus really is just
on completing these repairs to the propane heat exchangers. We're going to use the findings from what
we saw in Train 2 to plan the appropriate actions for Train 1 and Train 3. But at this point, Train 1 and 3
run normally as expected. And we've actually seen good stable operations out of them. So at this point,
there have not been challenges in delivering on our commitments, and I don't anticipate that as we look
forward.
Operator
We'll move next to Jason Gammel at Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I guess the first question I have for Pierre is, it's obviously a pretty tough quarter, but I wasn't necessarily
expecting cash from operations ex working capital to be negative. So can you address if there's anything
in the quarter that is sort of a one-off item that affected the cash number or is this just purely the result
of the core price and margin environment?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
So look, it was a challenging quarter. To put in perspective, we had a big beat last quarter and we had
a miss this quarter. And one of the primary drivers we talked about last quarter or we talked about this
morning is our timing effects. And as you know, Jason, these are effects that benefit us in a falling oil price
environment and reverse in a rising oil price environment. And we saw that, obviously, prices declining in
the first quarter and rising in the second quarter. And some of those effects do roll through cash because
it's essentially going through our COGS and it's the timing difference between when COGS are being
recognized relative to the underlying margin.
In addition to that, look, we had very volatile industry conditions. As you know, we had historically low
prices at times, very volatile pricing. And there were times where we did not capture what the benchmark
crudes are indicating. And that was true in the U.S. in certain times with the calendar roll and the physical
differentials which are adjusting very quickly, but it was a very fast-moving situation. And it was true
outside the U.S. for certain crudes. CPC blend at times was being discounted more heavily versus Brent.
Some of our West Africa crudes also were being discounted more heavily versus Brent than is typical in a
normal trading pattern.
And then we ran much lower utilization on the downstream than is typical. Again, we had unprecedented
demand decreases, rapidly changing demand decreases. We were managing our refinery system to be in
sync with the demand. In the U.S., our crude utilization was 55%, which is well below what the capacity
is. And it just points out how extraordinary the conditions were in the second quarter. So that results in
much lower volumes than we typically would sell and the resulting impact on margins.
The last thing I'd point out on earnings and it's not a cash effect is, we do make accruals for stock-based
compensation for all employees that have stock-based compensation. And in the first quarter, that was
favorable, and there was a swing. So there's no doubt there's some noncash elements in the earnings,
but realizations, volumes and aspects of the timing also roll through cash. There was nothing, I would say,
that was unusual except the industry conditions that were very unusual and extraordinary.

Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I appreciate that, Pierre. Hopefully, we won't ever see another quarter like this past one. Second question
is for Jay. Jay, this is the first time we've been able to speak with you since the Noble acquisition was
announced. I was hoping you might be able to give us your view of the quality and fit of those assets into
the Chevron portfolio and specifically interested in the Permian acreage and your view on the East Med
and the potential for future expansion.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. Thank you. Jason. We're obviously excited to have these assets join our portfolio. I think they're a
really nice set of assets, and they have an excellent fit with us. In the case of the Eastern Med and the
DJ Basin, we see 2 new operations of scale that fit quite well into our capabilities. We've worked for many
years in the Middle East, and this is a nice addition to our current portfolio. In Colorado, we're excited to
have an entry into the DJ that has such a long running room and good returns. In the Permian, it's a nice
add-on to our existing Permian operations in the Delaware Basin and about 90,000 acres coming into our
portfolio. So we see good synergies there.
And then there are other assets in the Noble portfolio that will be nice assets to have. We'll continue to
start evaluating their performance. And just on balance, I'm happy with what's coming into the portfolio.
I think it's going to be a really good fit, and there's a lot of good people in the Noble organization as well.
We're looking forward to bringing them into the family.
Operator
We'll go next to Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So my first one is on TCO and just following up on some of the prepared remarks, Jay, that you had. And
when we think about the critical path here for the back half of 2020 and really into the next few years, you
noted that you have all the materials on site to achieve that critical path. But I wanted to ask specifically
on the remobilization of the workforce and how you're planning that to continue to achieve execution on
the critical path items as we think about the overall project time line, any risk of delays? Just a little bit
more detail on how you're thinking about the interplay there with the critical path and remobilization of
workforce.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. Thank you. Well, as we've said, we made great progress over the wintertime. We're actually building
ahead of the schedule with the modules being completed on time and coming to us. They're coming to us
complete with good quality and dimensionally accurate. So they're meeting all of our expectations, and
we expect to have the sealift finished this year. Those are all key elements in maintaining schedule on the
project.
From the workforce on the ground standpoint, Kazakhstan, like many other countries, is going through a
significant impact from the COVID. And so as part of our precautions, we demobilized to about 20% of the
planned workforce in the second quarter. That's about 20,000 workers that we need to bring back. During
June and July, we've been doing a crew change on those people that were remaining in Tengiz, and that's
given us a chance to test the systems that we've been putting in place. And those involve testing people
at their point of origin before they return to Tengiz. Once they get to Tengiz, we have isolation camps set
up so that we can put people in isolation. Even with negative tests, we still put them in isolation to effect
the quarantine period then retest before they're allowed to progress to Tengiz.
We're using a pod strategy where we keep groups of workers together but isolated from other groups, and
that includes where they live, transportation, how they take meals, trying to make sure we have sufficient

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
mitigations in place to protect that workforce. Our fundamental concern is the safety of the workforce and
making sure that we can sustain operations as we rebuild.
We expect that mobilization to take place over about a 4-month period. But clearly, that's going to
be dependent upon the environment in Kazakhstan as well as just the difficulty of moving people
internationally for a project of this scale. And we'll take the learnings as we've done the crew change and
continue to adapt as we move forward into the remobilization.
Our focus continues on critical path activities, but we've got to also work off a large volume of work that
didn't get done in the second quarter. We expect some degree of impact, but to really be able to give you
any kind of an updated forecast on cost or schedule, we need to see how this remobilization goes. We
need to see how we're able to sustain people at work within the pandemic, and we'll be able to update
you, I think, more effectively probably in the first quarter of next year.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. That's very helpful. And my second question is one relating to the U.S. election and a short-
term and a longer-term part. And the shorter-term part is, there's a lot of discussion around potential
permitting or leasing changes, specifically on federal lands and waters. And one, just how you're thinking
about managing that potential risk given the large presence in the Gulf of Mexico?
And the second part of the question is the longer-term piece. There's also some discussion around things
like clean energy standard or investments from the federal government into things like clean hydrogen
over time and just how you're thinking about managing the business from an investment strategy longer
term to position Chevron for this potential shift in regulatory environment, maybe weave in the recent
announcement on the renewables partnership with Algonquin and how that fits in the longer-term strategy
as well.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sure, Devin, I'll start and let Jay address the question on federal leasing. I mean, at the highest level,
look, we work well at the federal, state and local levels in this country with governments of both parties.
And of course, we work with governments of different parties all around the world.
Energy is essential as the economy and the world economies recover from this pandemic, and jobs in oil
and gas are good paying jobs and are a big part of the economy in a number of states in the U.S. and a
number of countries around the world. We think whichever governments in the U.S. or in other countries,
the economy will be a priority coming out of this, and we think energy will be a big part of that.
We're a very responsible company, including our commitment to ESG, which I referred to, and actions
we're taking to reduce carbon intensity. So I think our approach on energy transition has 3 focus areas,
things that we can do to lower our carbon intensity. We have greenhouse gas intensity metrics out to
2023. How we can increase renewables and support our business. So the Algonquin partnership we just
announced is just a way to scale up what we've been doing previously. We had some wind and solar to our
operations in the Permian and in Bakersfield. And this gives us an alliance, a partnership to accelerate that
and scale it up globally.
We continue to do in the renewable space, renewable natural gas, renewable liquid fuels, actions that
reduce the carbon intensity of our products, in particular in California, consistent with the Low Carbon Fuel
Standard.
And then our third focus area is investing in breakthrough technologies. And that includes carbon
sequestration, hydrogen, batteries. We are operating one of the world's largest carbon sequestration
projects in Australia. So that's a long answer to say, we've been in business a long time. We intend to be
in business a long time. There are elections in this country and a number of countries that are occurring.
And we intend to be a constructive force wherever we operate, to be a good partner with whoever is

governing at that time. And we think there's a lot of common ground that we can find between what we
do as a company and what governments aspire to do. So with that, I'll turn it to Jay.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre. I'll build on that by just saying, I think there's actually a lot of common ground with where
the potential administrations want to go. Because we've already been focused on reducing flaring and
methane emissions, our greenhouse gas intensity and producing oil and gas, we've had a head start on
this. And we continue to stay focused on reducing the impact that we have as we produce these essential
products.
We think energy plays an essential role in economic growth. And these jobs in the Gulf of Mexico and the
Permian are important jobs to the economy. And I think the emphasis on natural gas as a bridging fuel
continues to support our operations in both the Gulf of Mexico and Permian.
So we'll continue to focus on reducing emissions and lowering our footprint, carbon footprint. But at the
same time, we're going to continue to work with whatever administration is in place and work to make
sure that there's a good understanding of potential regulation and the impacts that it may have as we
move forward.
Operator
We'll go next to Neil Mehta at Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
The first question I had is around cash flow breakeven. In the past, Pierre, you've talked about cash flow
after CapEx breakeven after $40, at $50 the dividend and at $60 the buyback. Just how do you think
about that math there now? There are a lot of moving pieces, particularly with downstream, and there's a
lot of flexibility on the CapEx side. But any math you can help us think about your Brent breakevens would
be helpful for aligning the models.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, Neil, I mean, you're exactly right. When we talk about oil breakevens, we're just talking about one
part of the portfolio and not everything else is held constant. So we've shown breakevens in the $50s.
The actions that we're taking is to get it down in the $40s. That has an assumption around downstream
performance. And you won't see that in the second quarter, but you'll see that certainly over time.
I guess I just would first step back and just say, we're in a different place than almost everyone else in our
industry. We have one of the strongest balance sheets. We're exiting the quarter here with a net debt ratio
of 17%. We've got excellent capital discipline and the ability to flex our capital program down. You saw
that we took it down 40% in 1 quarter with an extraordinary change in the circumstances, reserving the
capital, not spending capital to add barrels that just aren't needed right now as the world is contracting
and then coming out of it and hopefully recovering in a sustainable way.
We've been ahead of others. We started our asset sales and signed asset sales last year. And you saw
those close this quarter, generating cash. And again, we started our restructuring well before COVID, and
we're on plan. And we have that work on track. And of course, we signed an agreement to acquire Noble
Energy last week.
All of our actions are designed consistent with our financial priorities. The first is to sustain and grow the
dividend. We showed our stress test last quarter at $30 that I think was made very clear that we have the
financial capability and the flexibility in our capital program, the ability to manage our costs to sustain that
dividend through what is a stress test.
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
And we're continuing to sustain long-term value of the business. So although we're taking activity back in
the Permian because it brings on production in months and not years, that capital will come back when the
world needs the energy, and the value inherent in that resource is still there. And of course, we're making
investments, as Jay has talked about, in Tengiz, which will come on in several years. And again, we're
maintaining a strong balance sheet.
So that's the high-level framework. Our goal is to get our breakeven as obviously as low as we can. We're
planning for lower for longer. It's a very uncertain environment to Jason's question. We hope second
quarter was the bottom. It sure feels like it. Things are definitely better than they were in the second
quarter, in particular in that April-May time frame.
But we've got a plan for lower for longer, show our downside resiliency. We know how to manage the
upside. That won't be a problem, but make sure we support the long-term value so that we can not only
just pay the dividend now, but sustain and grow it over time.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Just to build on that a little bit, Pierre. One of the things I really like about the assets as well coming from
Noble is that they also have great capital flexibility. So it fits our strategy quite well. And about 75% of
the proved reserves have already been developed. So the big capital is largely in the past, and now we're
looking at the great opportunities for these assets.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division
Appreciate it. And a follow-up here is around impairments. You took $4.8 billion in the quarter. Can
you just talk about the framework by which you look at impairments? Obviously, your system is a
little different than the IFRS systems of your competitors. Do you think you're through the bulk of said
impairments? And just talk about your approach to calibrating them.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Sure. Well, let me start with fourth quarter when we took large impairments, and those were primarily
related to capital decisions, right? Decisions that we made that were primarily natural gas-related. And
this, again, of course, is pre-COVID, but in a capital disciplined way and trying to drive higher returns,
being really ruthless about where our capital is invested and making difficult choices. And that was
primarily the impact of the impairments that we saw in the fourth quarter.
This quarter, it was primarily for 2 reasons: one, unique situation, Venezuela, which I'll comment on, and
I'm sure Jay will add to; and we did lower our price outlook based on the economic impacts from the
global pandemic. So we don't know what the impacts will be. But clearly, with the economic contraction
and assuming economic recovery clearly, but it just results in lower demand for some time period. And we
reflected that in lower prices.
So in Venezuela, it's been a difficult operating environment for a while. Each quarter, we've been assessing
our investment value. In the second quarter, the environment became even more difficult. As an example,
our share of net production in June was just 7,000 barrels a day. So it's really fallen off. And so under the
accounting rules and the U.S. GAAP accounting rules, we have to assess whether the loss in value is other
than temporary. And if we view it as other than temporary, we take an impairment. And unlike IFRS, it
only goes in one direction.
The other ones were tied to the oil price, and I talked about a few of those, and then we had a severance.
So again, we follow U.S. GAAP. We're going to look at it each quarter. What I can say is, the impairments
this quarter, for the most part, had a different nature than last quarter.
And maybe one comment on the price-related one, then I'll kick it to Jay to talk about Venezuela.
The price-related ones are really hitting either mature assets, late-in-life assets, where the remaining
production term just gets impacted by the lower price outlook. The long-lived assets were not impaired.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
It was really mature, remaining short life duration where a lower price impacts the carrying value. But
maybe Jay can comment on Venezuela.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre. Venezuela, we took the impairment there, but our fundamental approach has not changed.
And that's that we are still committed to being present in Venezuela, and we look forward to one day
resuming full operations.
Our license was extended to the 1st of December 2020, and that license allows us to take on the activities
for safety and maintaining asset integrity. And our focus is on keeping people and the assets and
operations safe. We support communities in Venezuela. We believe we're a force for good. We'll continue
to be compliant with all laws and regulations, both in U.S. and Venezuela. And we just take it a day at a
time, but our commitment still remains. And we think the underlying asset value is still there.
Operator
We'll move next to Paul Sankey at Sankey Research.
Paul Sankey;Sankey Research
Can you hear me okay?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Paul.
Paul Sankey;Sankey Research
There's a couple of things. Firstly, on problems that you had in the quarter, a couple of the other mega
oil companies had very good trading results. Was it fair to characterize you guys as having a smaller
trading operation and appetite as a result of us not seeing a whole lot of benefit in the quarter, I was just
wondering.
And the second, the follow-up is, you mentioned breakeven. I think Jay, and I'm sure Jay in his comments
also mentioned breakeven. I thought you said breakeven at strip by the end of the year. Pierre, you were
talking about getting down towards $40. If I got that wrong in my head, could you just clarify what's in
those various moving parts? It might be downstream or I might have missed that, apologies, but if you
could just bring that together for me.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Okay. Let me just address the breakeven question. I think that was Neil who asked. Devin asked that.
Well, anyway, whoever asked it. So again, our breakeven in last year and early this quarter was low $50s.
And the actions we're taking, again, to reduce capital and reduce costs, which are right on track with our
guidance and are going very well. If everything else held constant, that would take our breakeven into the
$40s. But not everything else is held constant. In particular, downstream and chemicals, we talked about
weaker margins and much lower volume. So we'll have to see as that shakes out. But as the downstream
stabilizes over time, then those reductions should flow through to a lower breakeven.
We talked about Permian being free cash flow positive at strip pricing. So this year in the Permian, and
remember, we had that also as guidance in our Investor Day. It was at a much higher investment level as
we were on a different trajectory. But even at now this investment level and all the changes that are going
on, we affirm that we'll still be free cash flow positive. But that was only specific to the Permian, and that
was at strip pricing.
If we go to trading, we don't disclose our trading earnings separately. I wouldn't exactly characterize
our trading organization the way you said. But we've been pretty clear that the priorities for the trading

organization are flow, ensuring the flow of our upstream barrels in and out of our refineries, to optimize
around those positions and then to trade. And certainly, at times in the quarter, the market had steep
contango, which created trading opportunities for our organization. And you'll see those results in the
upstream and downstream segments this quarter and in future quarters.
Operator
We'll go next to Jeanine Wai at Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
My first question is on the overall business. And I guess understanding that growth is an output of
capital allocation decision. You're working really hard to materially reduce the cost structure. Is there an
opportunity for Chevron to meet the prior ROCE and 3% CAGR targets that you laid out at the analyst
meeting at a Brent price below the former $60 that you talked about or are those targets just kind of no
longer the right way to think about the business given your updated view on the macro? I know you just
mentioned that you were planning for lower for longer.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, let me start, and Jay might want to add. I mean, yes, certainly, the ability to deliver that kind of
production volume is there because all of the resource and the opportunities, whether it's in the Permian,
whether it's the other opportunities we showed during our Investor Day, they are all there.
Now there's no doubt, we had our Investor Day on March 3. And by that weekend, and we showed a $60
Brent nominal flat pricing for 5 years, which everyone agreed was a reasonable assumption, I think. And
by the weekend, oil was in the $30s when the Russian-Saudi agreement fell apart. And then a few weeks
later, we were in a massive economic contraction. So there's no doubt that the world has changed from
that Investor Day. And we're in the middle of our planning process, and we'll provide revised updated
guidance. But our ability to deliver that kind of production is absolutely there. The question will be, is that
still the right strategy?
I think we have to step back and look at a sector that is underperforming the broader equity markets. And
we're underperforming primarily because of low returns and a lack of capital discipline. So when you hear
us talk about capital discipline in our organic portfolio and the actions that Jay is taking to be disciplined
with our capital and in our downstream, too, being disciplined around the capital to approach the energy
transition to Devin's question, we have to do that in a disciplined way. And then inorganically, we have
to be disciplined with capital. The only way to increase returns and regain favor with investors is not by
outgrowing and is not by having capital flowing back into opportunities, it's by being very disciplined and
generating high returns by being really ruthless in our allocation.
So I think that's all a way to say that we're going to revise our plans. All the opportunities are there.
Whether that's the most optimal outlook going forward, we'll decide. But our commitment to capital
discipline, our commitment to raising returns is going to continue, and it's essential for us to be able to
deliver higher returns over time.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. I think to build on that, we had very strong performance last year and coming into this. But well
before the COVID crisis hit, we had already embarked on a transformation effort, and that transformation
effort was all-encompassing. It covers every aspect of the company. And it's really built on trying to better
integrate technology into our operations and our workflows, making sure that we're as efficient as we can
be across our organizations, how do we provide technical services to our business units.
In the upstream, we reduced from 4 to 3 regions. That went into effect July 1. We've reduced 1 to 2 layers
across our organization. We're building on that geographic-based business unit in the upstream, which has
served us so well, but we're adding in asset class coordination across business units so we can better team

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
and perform across business unit boundaries, geographic boundaries and segment boundaries. And we've
also added in additional focus on value chains and making sure that we're getting the highest realization
for our upstream products that we can all the way through the value.
So the transformation itself, while it involves some restructuring, I think some of the biggest impact
that's going to come is around how we think about the business, the financial fluency that we're getting
throughout our workforce to focus on improving returns and understanding where the gaps are between
what's possible and where we are today as well as incorporating, as Pierre said, the lower-for-longer
mentality, the lower activity levels, lower turnaround activity and some of the other effects that we're
seeing.
So as you put all this together, I think we'll continue to see not only the commitment towards lowering our
cost structure, but I do think we're going to find ways to continue to drive for that aspiration of improving
returns.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. Yes. My follow-up is kind of a similar question but on the Permian in terms of just looking
medium and longer term and on the efficiency improvements that you mentioned. Before you've
mentioned that Chevron can grow the Permian to about 1.2 million barrels a day at $4 billion to $5 billion
a year of CapEx. I know that's a ways off. But beyond the drilling efficiencies that you mentioned and
assuming there's a recovery in demand, how material could some of these efficiency improvements be
that you've mentioned? Meaning specifically, based on what you've seen, do you think you could deliver
the same or similar productive capacity of that 1.2 million a day but on materially lower CapEx?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, Jeanine. I think we're poised to continue to drive increased efficiency throughout the Permian
operations. The drilling is just one example where we're seeing that efficiency, but the advances in
technology, the advances in our understanding of the reservoirs and how to best complete and produce
from those, the integration of our operation centers, the maintenance, the operations are all driving
efficiency.
While the near-term activity levels, we've changed those because we can and because we think it's
prudent given the current environment that we find ourselves in, the underlying long-term value and even
mid-term value of this asset is unchanged. And I'm actually really excited about the changes that we're
making in how we are working together in the organization. And so I do expect to see us be able to deliver
on previous expectations and continue to deliver on becoming a more efficient, more effective operator in
the Permian Basin.
Operator
We'll go next to Paul Cheng at Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
I have 2 questions. I think one for Jay, one for Pierre. Jay, you mentioned about the problem in Gorgon.
It's a bit surprising given it's a new machine. I mean, the train has only come on stream for, say, less
than 5 years and that you have this problem. So is the problem is a design issue or that is just poor
workmanship? And also whether the same vendor is applying those to the Train 1 and Train 3 as well as in
Wheatstone? And if they are, have you already did some inspection on those unit?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, Paul. So the defects that we found in the welds, we believe, were there from the original
manufacturer. They're not a design defect at all, but they are a manufacturing defect. They were
Copyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
discovered in Train 2 when we took Train 2 down for its first major turnaround and inspection. And as I
said, as part of the routine inspection, that's when we encountered this particular issue.
We are evaluating based on the learnings that we've got how to best address trains 1 and 3. And we've
put additional mitigations in place until that's been accomplished. We do not have the same manufacturer
for the vessels in Wheatstone. It's a different manufacturer, and I don't expect to see the same issue
replicated there.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
And Jay, Train 1 and Train 3 already went through the full turnaround recently, right, just in the last year
or 2?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
No. Train 1 went through the turnaround last year. Train 3 is scheduled for next year.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
So that if that's a risk, yes, Train 3 has more of the risk than Train 1 then because I assume that if there's
an issue, when you went through the turnaround in Train 1 you should have already discovered?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We did not see the issue in Train 1, but we're assessing whether or not we need to re-evaluate that
inspection and go through it again. And we are addressing how best to inspect and if necessary, repair
Train 3 at this time.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Okay. So Train 3...
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Paul. Do you have any second question?
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Sure. Second question is for Pierre. I heard about, say, that improving return is one of the top priority for
the company. We appreciate that. But we then hear that we have conflicting maybe priority because from
a cash flow standpoint, you are cutting your CapEx in Permian, and Permian actually is your highest return
project, while that you're still investing in Anchor and Tengiz, which has clearly that much lower return
comparing to Permian. So how exactly that the company is going to be able to raise your return when you
are not investing at least in the next maybe year or 2 in the most profitable project? I mean, what steps
that you will be able to take?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
So Paul, one of the things we're doing, as you know, we've been bringing our unit development cost in
the deepwater down significantly. Our target is to be below $20 a barrel. Anchor, as we've talked about
in the past, opens up new opportunities for us in a new class of deepwater assets. We are pacing the
development of Anchor in its most efficient pace. We're not focused on having to bring it on by a certain
date, but rather keeping all the different aspects of the project consistent and aligned as we move through
the impacts of the COVID crisis.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
In terms of the Permian, it's simply, we don't see the point of investing in any assets around the world
to bring on new production capacity when the world is so heavily oversupplied. And so because we have
that flexibility, we're exercising that. And we'll continue to look at the current environment and begin
ramping up funding and activities when it's appropriate to do so and we see a better overall supply-
demand balance, better fundamentals for the industry.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The only add to what Jay said, look, we're going to be diversified across different asset classes. We're
not going to be a pure-play company. And they're operating on different time frames. And one involves
production that comes on in years and one involves production that comes on in months, and we're
making that distinction. So we've been laser-focused on capital that supports long-term value. Capital
that's adding short-term production has been hit very hard. Thanks, Paul. We appreciate your questions.
Operator
We'll move next to Roger Read at Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I guess 2 things to follow up on. First question for you, Jay, on TCO. Just what do you think the critical,
you mentioned critical path items. What are those in 2020 and 2021 we really ought to keep our eyes on
for confidence that the project is coming along as expected. And then I don't know if this second question
is for Pierre or for you. But as you think about your outlook for the Permian unconventional in '21, the
down 6% to 7%. When does that become a written in stone event versus something that you could tweak
and we could see something different?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
So the critical path for TCO FGP project, it really runs through the setting of all the utility modules and the
compressor boost facilities for the wellhead pressure management part of the project and getting those
fully integrated. And that's where our real focus is. So it's mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work
once those modules are set on their foundations. That really represents the main focus. But there's a lot of
work as well that has to be maintained in parallel with that to be able to deliver the project as expected.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And look, on the Permian, we could bring completion crews back very quickly if that were to happen.
So again, it's just we're in the middle of our planning process. We'll update our capital budget. But
even after we have a capital budget, we can reallocate capital if the world changes. And there's a lot of
flexibility in the Permian. It goes back to the earlier question. There's a lot of value there. So we'd want to
see the sustained economic recovery, see inventory levels heading down, but it's something that we could
change very quickly by adding completion crews and then adding rigs over time.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Just as we brought it down, we can take it back up.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Roger.

Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I just got a couple of quick ones. Pierre, perhaps you could just elaborate on your change of price
assumption. And what I'm really looking for is, do you anticipate that you will continue to add debt given
you've got substantial headroom as you pointed out last quarter over the foreseeable future?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
I'm sorry. You broke up a little bit on your question, Doug. Can you say that again?
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Yes. So can you hear me now?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. So do you anticipate adding additional debt given you still got substantial headroom as you pointed
out last quarter? And if you can elaborate, please, on the change of price assumptions that you referred to
earlier.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So on the price assumption, I'm not sure I can say much more. We don't disclose our price outlooks.
We view it as commercially sensitive. We're obviously in the market at times selling or buying assets, and
we wouldn't want our counterparty to know what our price outlook is. We don't think that's in the interest
of our shareholders. But again, we lowered our price outlook primarily due to what we think are the likely
lower economic activities due to the global pandemic. No one knows what the recovery will look like, but
it's clear that there's been an economic contraction, and it will take some time period to recover. And our
products are so closely linked to economic activity.
In terms of debt, we had a very successful bond issuance that we did right after last quarter. It was better
than any of our peers in terms of the pricing. And we'll continue to monitor the market. We're in a very
strong position. Our commercial paper balances are well below levels, very comfortable levels, but we
always look at where the market is and what our liquidity is. And we certainly could go to the bond market
and do another issuance if we think it's the right thing to do.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Then my follow-up for Jay real quick. Jay, I think you had a question early, but your comments about
Gorgon, can you just elaborate, is this a tube bundle head issue or what is the remediation that you're
anticipating? I'll leave it there.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
So are you asking about the repair for the vessels?

Yes. I'm just trying to understand the nature of the problem and what remediation, what options you have
for remediation.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
It's really just grinding out and replacing a weld that had some abnormalities and ensuring that we have
the structural and the pressure containing capacity that we're looking for.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. So no tube bundle replacement?
Pierre R. Breber

Sorry. You're breaking up again, Doug.

Sorry, no tube bundle replacement required?

We'll go next to Sam Margolin at Wolfe Research. Sam, you may have your line muted. I'm sorry, Sam,
we're not hearing you. You may have your line muted. We'll go next to Biraj Borkhataria with Royal Bank
of Canada.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
I just had a couple of quick ones. The first one is on TCO. I think, Jay, you mentioned that you used up
some of the contingency on timing. But can you talk about how much contingency there is left on cost?
And just get a sense around that. And then I have a follow-up on the impairments.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
The efficiencies that we saw in our schedule and the gains that we made on schedule were consistent with
also gains we are making on cost. But to really tell you where we are, we're going to have to see how
we get through this fourth quarter remobilization and sustaining the workforce. So we'll update cost and
schedule probably early next year.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And Biraj, we've said about $1 billion less capital this year. A portion of that is deferral, about half, but a
portion is lower currency effects or currency benefits and higher productivity. So we think some of those
cost savings are rolling through. It's not all just deferral.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Okay. Understood. And then maybe one for you, Pierre. On the impairments, alongside the lower
commodity prices, did you also adjust your expectations on medium-term refining and chems margins?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
There are no impairments. They're all upstream-related. So yes, we have, again, we have various outlooks
for upstream and downstream and chemicals margin. But the impairments were all upstream-related, and
there's no LNG, no refining, no chemicals. And again, Venezuela is the biggest part of it. There was the
price-related impacts, and then there were some suspended costs that also were written off.
Operator
Our last question comes from Jason Gabelman at Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask about the downstream business, specifically, U.S. downstream was particularly weak this
quarter. I think even attributing all the timing impacts to the U.S. portion of downstream, it still would
have missed, I think, what people were expecting. Can you just talk about some of the challenges you're
experiencing, particularly in that part of the business? I'm thinking along the lines of maybe your over-
indexation to the West Coast was a headwind this quarter and the outlook for that part of the business in
the near term. And I have a follow-up.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The first thing I'd say is, our execution across upstream and downstream was excellent. I mean, we
ran safely and reliably across our upstream and downstream portfolio under very difficult conditions and
again, extraordinary kind of market conditions.
Jason, I referred to our U.S. crude utilization in the second quarter was 55%. Now it's operating higher
than that now. It's north of 70% and it's heading towards 80% here in the next couple of weeks. So there
were extraordinary contractions. We matched our supply to our demand. We have sales channels through
our retailers and marketers, and we were going to meet their demand, but we tried to minimize any build
in inventories and try to match, which is very unusual. Obviously, we had to significantly reduce our jet
production because the jet reductions were even more significant. So the actual execution we thought
was outstanding. It's just I don't think the model, frankly, worked under the circumstances that we had
in the second quarter. I led that business for 3 years. Nowhere did we ever plan to run at 55% of crude
utilization. Nowhere did we plan to make as little jet as we possibly could. So it's really extraordinary
conditions. It was all very well executed. But I think when you take the timing effects, margins, which are
not entirely transparent across the portfolio and big volume effect, I think you'll get there.
The West Coast, I mean, it just varies. There were times the West Coast was better. There were times
the West Coast was worse. I mean, I wouldn't view it, if you look at inventory levels on the West Coast
and PADD 5, they're actually below year ago level. So there was nothing, I think, structural. It was a fast-
moving set of circumstances in the second quarter. Different regions were operating at different time
periods. Asia, outside the U.S., obviously, held up better in the second quarter. It was more impacted in
the first quarter. And that's the kind of nature of operating right now through a global pandemic and the
economic impacts of it.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Sure. And then the follow-up. The next kind of large project, I guess, in your queue is, once TCO ends, are
the 2 petchem crackers that have been proposed within the CPChem JV. I think those were deferred from
being FID-ed either late this year or early next year, but the FID was pushed out. Can you just talk about

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 21
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL | JUL 31, 2020
how you're thinking about FID-ing those 2 crackers and your overall thoughts about chemicals demand
growth given the pandemic?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. I mean, well, chemicals demand has held up better than our refined products, and demand is flat to
maybe even up a little bit. So there's been some mix effects. Some things are up, some things are down.
But overall, petchem demand has held up pretty well. But as you know, even pre-COVID, margins are
weak. There's been a lot of supply added.
So I'll just keep going to capital discipline. And that's really the key for the company and for the industry.
It's not just the demand side. We've got to look at the supply side. So we have very competitive projects.
They are on the low end of the cost curve. In other words, they can compete better than most others,
right? They have very advantaged feedstocks. We believe they'll have very low construction cost. But
you're right, we are pacing and deferring those decisions until we get more clarity.
We like the business long term. We'd like to invest in it long term, but we just have to see where the
economy goes and really where industry players go in terms of how disciplined everyone will be about
capital investments going forward.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is
being recorded.
I would now turn the call over to your host for today's program, the General Manager of Investor Relations
of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. Our
Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides
that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Wayne. Before we get started, I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Our
thoughts are with all the families affected by COVID-19 and especially with the health care workers on the
front lines battling every day to contain the outbreak. I'm also incredibly grateful to our employees who
show up for work every day, particularly those out in the field, operating critical facilities to provide an
energy that supports the pandemic response and keeps essential goods and services flowing in support of
the economy. They, too, are heroes.
During our Security Analyst Meeting in March, we discussed Chevron's resilience, and now it's time for us
to demonstrate it. No one foresaw these specific market conditions, but we were prepared for them. We
know what to do, and we're doing it as we execute this 5-point action plan.
First and foremost, we're focused on the safety of our employees and our operations. Next, we're
exercising the flexibility in our capital program. Today, we're further lowering our full year guidance.
In addition to capital, costs always matter in a commodity business. We initiated a major company
restructuring last year, and we expect to drive additional savings this year and next.
Capital structure also matters. We came into this crisis with an industry-leading balance sheet, and we're
taking actions intended to maintain financial strength. Lastly, while addressing current market conditions,
we're preserving long-term value for shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.
I'll speak to each element of this action plan in the following slides, beginning with safe and reliable
operations on Slide 4.
We've had fewer than 50 confirmed cases of employees with the virus, and nearly all cases appear
to have been contracted outside the workplace. Most of our office-based employees are able to work
from home. For those who continue working at facilities or in the field, we've implemented multilayer
screening, distancing, hygiene and PPE protocols. Our COVID-19 testing capability is ramping up. Finally,
we're helping our communities with donations of money, PPE and other things we can manufacture, like
sanitizers in our plants and 3D-printed face shields.
In downstream, our refineries are running well below capacity to meet significantly lower product demand.
Where possible, we're prioritizing equity crudes into our refining system and reoptimizing our plans
for turnarounds. In upstream, the rig count will be down by about 60% by the end of this quarter. In

May, we expect to curtail between 200,000 and 300,000 barrels of oil equivalent production, and we
expect curtailments to continue in June. LNG contract sales have been unaffected. Despite some logistics
challenges, our supply chains have been functioning with no major disruptions. We're closely monitoring
financial risks to our suppliers and working with them on win-win solutions.
Now I'll give an update on our major project underway in Kazakhstan. Despite the early COVID outbreak
in Korea, module fabrication and shipments out of the fabrication yard remain on schedule. In fact, only
7 modules remain in the yard, and all are scheduled to depart this quarter. Restacking of the modules in
Tengiz is progressing well and was ahead of schedule at the end of April.
That said, the pandemic is presenting challenges. Restrictions on the movement of people and goods and
positive COVID cases in 6 of the more than 100 residential camps in Tengiz have triggered changes. While
critical path construction activities proceed, we're temporarily demobilizing noncritical path personnel. As
a result, we anticipate some degree of impact to project cost and schedule, but it's too early to quantify
this in any meaningful way. Our forecast of 2020 capital expenditures for the project has been reduced by
about $1 billion, our share, due to deferred activity, cost mitigations and expected currency benefits.
Turning to our overall capital outlook. We're further lowering our full year 2020 organic capital guidance to
as low as $14 billion, down from $16 billion announced in March. Second half CapEx could be as low as $6
billion or a run rate up to 40% lower than our original budget. The incremental reductions since our March
press release are primarily focused on TCO and short-cycle investments.
Turning to Slide 7. In response to current market conditions, we expect to reduce operating costs by about
$1 billion this year relative to 2019 due to reduced activity levels, lower fuel costs and curtailment of other
discretionary expenditures.
Beyond the current year, our initiative outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting to lower OpEx by another
$1 billion next year is progressing well. A portion of these savings will come from restructuring, where we
expect design to be finalized this quarter with the streamlined organization in place by year-end. Costs
often lag during market corrections. We were already working on further cost reductions before these
conditions began and intend to keep pace with today's realities.
Turning to the next slide. The chart on the left shows our estimated sources and uses of cash under a
2-year stress test with sustained prices of $30 Brent. Our decision to suspend the repurchase program,
lower costs and flex capital down will reduce the pull on our balance sheet. Chart on the right shows we
have the debt capacity to weather this stress test better than our peers. All our actions are consistent with
our long-standing financial priorities, and number one is to protect the dividend, which we know is vital to
our shareholders.
Turning to Slide 9 and the fifth element of our action plan, preserving long-term value. While we have
the flexibility to take capital even lower, we're focused on the right spending to ensure that existing
assets are safe and reliable, projects already under construction are efficiently completed, operational and
technical capabilities are maintained, investment options are preserved for the future and we maintain our
commitment to ESG priorities. During a market downturn, the playbook in our industry isn't a secret. The
key is how you execute it. The winners are the one that make the right choices, best balancing short-term
cash flow and long-term value. We made the right choices coming into this crisis. And we intend to exit in
the best position among our peers.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. Turning to Slide 10. First quarter earnings were $3.6 billion or $1.93 per share. Adjusted
earnings, which excludes special items and foreign exchange, were $2.4 billion or $1.29 per share. A
reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation. Cash flow from
operations was $4.7 billion and total capital spending was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we also increased
our dividend and repurchased $1.75 billion of shares before suspending the share repurchase program.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
Turning to cash flow. Excluding working capital, cash flow from operations cover the dividend and cash
CapEx in the first quarter, yielding a dividend breakeven under $50 Brent. Proceeds from the sales of our
interest in Malampaya were offset by loans to TCO. Given volatile market conditions, we're holding more
cash and ended the quarter with a net debt ratio of 14%.
Turning to the next slide. First quarter earnings of $3.6 billion increased about $1 billion versus the
same quarter last year. Included in the current quarter was a gain on the sale of upstream assets in the
Philippines and favorable tax items. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower prices, partially
offset by higher production. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing
effects and higher marketing margins. The other segment decreased primarily due to lower corporate
charges.
Turning to Slide 13. Compared to the fourth quarter, first quarter adjusted earnings decreased by about
$400 million. Adjusted upstream earnings decreased due to lower prices, partially offset by higher
production and lower OpEx. Adjusted downstream earnings increased primarily due to favorable timing
effects and lower OpEx.
On Slide 14, first quarter oil equivalent production increased over 6%. Higher shale and tight production,
primarily in the Permian, and higher entitlement effects were partially offset by asset sales and normal
base declines.
Turning to the next slide. We're nearing completion on the asset sales program announced in 2018. In
April, we closed the sale of our interest in Azerbaijan and Colombia, resulting in almost $1.5 billion in
before-tax proceeds. This brings our total asset sales proceeds to about $6.5 billion since 2018, in the
middle of our $5 billion to $10 billion guidance range.
Turning to Slide 16. With cash on hand, access to the commercial paper market and our backup revolver,
Chevron's liquidity position remains strong. We have limited long-term debt maturing over the next 2
years. And as a AA credit, we have ample access to the debt market.
Now looking ahead. In upstream, we're not changing our full year production guidance, although we're
clarifying that it excludes the impact of curtailments. As Mike said earlier, we expect curtailments of
production during the second quarter, in the U.S., primarily due to economic choices that balance cash
flow and long-term value; and in certain countries outside the U.S., mostly due to the OPEC+ agreement.
Planned turnarounds in the second quarter, primarily at Gorgon, are expected to impact production by
about 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Based on our current price and capital outlook, TCO co-lending is expected to be modestly higher this
year. In downstream, turnaround activity in the second quarter is expected to have an estimated after-
tax earnings impact of $200 million to $300 million. Both equity affiliate earnings and distributions are
expected to be lower in 2020, with a net negative effect to cash flow less than $1 billion.
With that, I'll turn it over to Wayne.

All right. Yes. Okay. I wasn't on mute, but there -- but it seems like it wasn't going through. But if you can
hear me now, maybe I'll try to pick up where I think Phil left off on the stress test for $30 Brent. When we
think about where the stress test takes you from a leverage standpoint or debt-to-capital standpoint over
that 2-year period, can you talk a little bit about where you'd end up at the end of 2021 and also where
you would be comfortable in terms of taking leverage to and at what...

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, we -- I think we got the essence of it, which is where you end up at the end of '21 and how
comfortable are you there. Pierre, you want to respond to that?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. So thanks for the question. Look, the chart on the left, we -- gives an indication of the negative cash
flow that we expect under a stress test at $30 Brent. And then the chart on the right shows our debt
position relative to peers and relative to the 0 line, which is a net debt ratio of 25%. And when you put
the 2 together, where the negative cash flow or that incremental debt, it keeps us -- we're still to the right
of that 0 line. So in other words, we can have 2 years at $30 Brent, invest in the business, sustain our
dividend and still exit in -- at the end of 2021 with a net debt ratio less than 25%, which we think is still a
very strong balance sheet.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I might just add, Devin. We're protecting the dividend because we're set up to do so, and we've made
it a priority. As Pierre said, we enter with balance sheet strength that is second to none, an advantaged
portfolio with a low breakeven, capital discipline that's part of our DNA. We've demonstrated it through
the way we're managing capital spending, our discipline on transactions. And we've got capital flexibility.
And all of this is because we're committed to the dividend. And you can see that while we do lean on
the balance sheet to fund the capital program over this period of time, we can support the dividend
comfortably and still remain in a very healthy position, and we've set ourselves up to do so.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Devin. Did you have a follow-up?
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes. So a follow-up just on the capital spending side, building on that a little bit. So can you talk a little bit
about how you think about the trade-off between some of the near-term cuts in capital spending, which
really skewed more toward short-cycle, versus one of your priorities of retaining long-term optionality and
continue to support longer-term growth? So that preservation of long-term value point. So how do you
think about that trade-off? And also, how much additional flexibility, if any, is there, as you look at the
budget where it stands today?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Devin. So a few years ago, we really had a budget that was skewed towards the long-term end of the
spectrum. And we've consciously shifted that now to have the short-term weighting much higher within
our portfolio because it gives us the flexibility that you talked about. And it's underpinned with the longer-
term projects, but it's not dominated by those. So we built a more flexible portfolio that allows us to slow
down the short-cycle investments when the market signal indicates that those are not being rewarded in
the marketplace. And yet we're maintaining the ability to ramp those up. And we have longer-term capital
projects that are earlier in phase, and we'll be very disciplined in bringing those forward.
The other thing that's different that's really important is a much larger percentage of our portfolio now is
facility-limited versus reservoir-limited and characterized by the kinds of declines that you can see in a
different portfolio. And that enables us to hold production with more modest capital spend and preserve
the cash flow that's associated with that. So look, we're conscious of things like leases. We're conscious
of the way we're developing our resources. But we're trading those things off. And when the market is not

Neil Singhvi Mehta

Okay. All right. Maybe a little bit of a pause and it works. All right. So I guess the first question was
around curtailments. And can you walk us through with a little more depth about where they are,
magnitude? And as we think about production shut-ins, what gives us confidence that there won't be
any structural damage to the assets and we have confidence that the supply can return when the market
ultimately needs it?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. And so let me just frame it up a little bit, Neil. I was just talking to Devin about balancing cash
flow and long-term value. And that's certainly a key driver here as we're looking at curtailments. We
are avoiding -- we're trying to avoid the need for abrupt shut-ins. So these truly are, broadly speaking,

curtailments rather than shut-ins with a very conscious effort to preserve reservoir and well integrity. We
do these things for turnarounds, for storms and the like. So we know how to do this quite well. And we
really don't expect any issues as we ramp back up.
Curtailments in April were relatively modest. As Pierre outlined with the forward guidance, May and
June look like they could be more significant, about 50-50 between the U.S. and rest of the world. And
certainly, in the U.S., the Permian and the short-cycle piece of it is the predominant part. Around the rest
of the world, it tends to be related to OPEC and OPEC+ commitments and the way those are translating
into local conditions. But we're very cognizant of where and how we slow production and expect to be able
to return production when the market changes in relatively short order without putting reservoir or well
integrity at risk.

[Audio Gap]
We see that you put a pause on the project or at least slowed down spending. So can we do a status
check of how far you've gotten so far and how it's progressing, what the ultimate plan is around execution
from here? And any early thoughts on what that slowdown could mean for the full project budget?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So the project is about 75% complete right now, Neil; construction, 56-or-so percent. Logistics are
working very well. As I said, there are only 7 modules left in Korea, and all of those will have departed by
the end of this quarter. We've got a number on the water, additional ones at the transshipment locations
and some moving through the waterways. So the logistics are moving quite well. Since late 2019, we've
got all of the pipe racks and the gas turbine generators and utility modules on foundation. And we
continue to work on the critical path.
Locally, I mentioned we've seen COVID cases in a number of the camps. There's over 100 different
residential camps there. And as a result, we are demobilizing nonessential staff to minimize the risk of
spread. That means we're demobilizing about 17,000 people to 20 different locations. Most of these are
contractors, not employees of TCO, but we are helping to manage the logistics. The -- there -- we're
moving people back to other parts of Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Singapore, the U.K.
We need to provide contact tracing information for everybody who demobilizes. We've converted a
fire station and a warehouse to a test center. We're testing 1,500 people a day. We've got 29 nurses

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
there working around the clock. So a very thoughtful effort on how we demobilize. The people that are
remaining are working, in essence, under a pod strategy where workforce is isolated by shift and by crew.
We've got boxed meals, digital permits. We've got dedicated drivers and cleaners and things to really
reduce the risk. Employees are all outfitted in proper PPE and the like.
We actually are maintaining pretty good schedule progress on the critical path in spite of all of this, which
allows us to focus the workforce on critical path and to demobilize some of the noncritical path activity.
Our power and control work, the gathering system, the sour gas injection system are all several months
ahead of the critical path, and that enables us to slow down and mitigate some of these risks. The biggest
challenges are in the area of crew changes. So we have people working on some extended rotations,
transit in and out. And the labyrinth of travel restrictions at each level, cities, countries, et cetera, is
something we're managing aggressively and carefully. We're testing people as they arrive to minimize
quarantine on arrival. So a very focused and, thus far, I would say, a very successful effort to respond to
this. The main focus is on the pressure boost facility and the utilities and the processing plant, which are
on the critical path.
In terms of the actual reduction in C&E, our share, about $1 billion, about half of that is deferral of
activity. About 1/3 of that is mitigation of cost growth through aggressive creative measures. And the
balance is really related to foreign exchange.
So hopefully, that gives you a sense of where we are. And certainly, as we go forward on every call, we'll
know more, we'll see how things have unfolded there and we will provide you additional information as we
have it.

my first question, now that you can hear me, is on sustaining CapEx. And we know, Mike, that you don't
really talk about sustaining CapEx on a 1-year basis at all. But can you comment on whether the new $12
billion annualized CapEx run rate is enough to maintain what you would consider an acceptable reserve
replacement ratio over a longer-term period and whether this can also allow you to achieve your corporate
objectives of increasing RSE, shareholder returns and all of that, but maybe at a different rate from what
you thought before?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Jeanine, you are correct. This really isn't a way that we think about the business. It's not something
we rely on or plan around to measure the business. So it's not a simple question to answer because it's
just not how we think about things. We do understand it's a question among some in the investment
community.
Pierre has been thinking about how to try to help you guys understand this a little bit better and translate
from how we run the business to how these questions come in. So Pierre, maybe you can help Jeanine
with that.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Jeanine. And as Mike says, we don't think about the business this way. And to the earlier
question, we're not sustaining short-term production, right? That's a very deliberate choice. Mike talked
about that. The price signal says we don't need a short-term production, and we're prioritizing capital on
long-term value. So again, if sustaining short-term production is part of the definition, then it's just not
how we manage the business as we're trying to balance the short term and the long term.
But if we think of sustaining capital as kind of an analytical construct, that's really the capital to keep
upstream production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years. And so in that definition, I'd
exclude exploration. I'd exclude capital to develop new fields or for expansions like in Tengiz. I'd exclude
assets that are sold or contracts that are going to expire. And I'd exclude downstream and chemicals.
And so if you go through that, and you know we talk about $11 billion for our upstream base business
and shale and tight total capital, and that results in some growth, about $10 billion would be a reasonable
estimate of the capital to keep that production capacity flat from existing fields for a number of years.
Again, we're below that right now, right? We started with base and shale and tight at 11. As you -- if you
roll through the reductions, we'll be under 8. So again, short-term production, we do not expect to be
sustained at that -- at your kind of notional $12 billion capital, which includes downstream and chemicals
with some cuts and exploration. But long-term value is preserved.

We've got you, Paul.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Perfect. All right. I think that -- it seems that potentially that we will cut off. So I will ask both questions
first. I think the first one, Mike, in a -- not that you will have a target now, but the sector has been
compressed and a lot of your peers is under distress. If that's a right deal, how much is the balance sheet
you're willing to risk in this kind of environment for the right deal at all?
And the second question, may as well that -- ask that question in case I get cut off. This is for Pierre. You
have a strong balance sheet, but it look like you're going to have a substantial cash burn for this year and
next year under a pretty depressed pricing environment that we see. You raised some debt. Does it make
sense for you, given the debt market is actually open and the cost is quite low for you at this point, to
raise even more debt to prefund the potential cash burn or that you think the commercial market is winner
available and you don't need to do that?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Yes, Paul. You're an experienced multipart questioner. So I think that was good to get both of those
in. Let me give you a quick response, and then Pierre, I'm sure, will have some thoughts he'd like to add
there. The reason we showed this low price stress test, Paul, was to give you a sense that we really can
endure a couple of years of really tough pricing. And our gearing would move back to a level that is not
an uncomfortable level to be at. In fact, Pierre has said frequently that over time, we would anticipate
moving our gearing back into the kind of 20% to 25% range anyway. Now this isn't necessarily the way
we thought we would get there, but that's not an uncomfortable place for us to be.
So leaning on the balance sheet through this period of time is something that's very doable, and we'll
maintain a strong credit rating as we do that. And so we're certainly willing to go there. And as you know,
in years gone by, you go back a few years ago, our gearing was above that 25%. And so I think we're in a
range that's -- we've demonstrated we can manage and we know how to.
In terms of going to debt markets at low cost, I do think that it's prudent to look at that. And debt is
attractively priced right now, and it wouldn't be surprising for us to look to add to that. So Pierre, maybe
you can comment.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. I think there was an M&A question too there, about using our balance sheet for M&A, but I think I can
just address, you can also use equity as part of a transaction. So we don't view the balance sheet as the
only means to do M&A because equity makes sense in an oil deal where there's price risk and, obviously,
price volatility, and you wouldn't want a winner and loser between the buyer and the seller on an M&A
deal.
In terms of -- I think Mike addressed the debt question. I mean, yes, as we consume cash, we will
lengthen out the -- our -- the maturities. We'll look at when there's a good window to approach the bond
markets. We do have access to a lot of commercial paper that was shown on the liquidity side. Commercial
paper still remains the lowest cost and the most flexible source of funding for us. But under these kinds of
conditions and if the conditions persist, we would want to have some more longer-term debt. That would
be appropriate. And I think, as Mike said, you shouldn't be surprised if you see us approach the market.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Paul. I'm sorry, I missed the M&A angle on your first question.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We've got you, Paul.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
To add to the confusion, I was indeed on mute, believe it or not. I apologize. Sorry about that.
The question is how has the world changed for you post this thing. Obviously, we can see the future
strip is pressured for 2021. And I think you've addressed that a little bit. I think it's clear that your
megaprojects, Australia, Kazakhstan, sort of continue as they were and ultimately have very low
breakevens when they're running. I guess the question would be, firstly, on the Gulf of Mexico, is the
world, do you think, different there? And most importantly, obviously, for your company, we know that you
wanted to buy Anadarko for the acreage in the Permian, how do you think that the world has changed as
regards to the Permian given what's happened?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Thank you, Paul. Well, it's -- I think when you're at the depth of something as unprecedented as
this, it's hard to say exactly how the world will change on the other side of it. And as much as it feels like
this has been going on for a long time, we're really just a couple of months into it. And so I think on the
other side of it, I'm an optimist. I have great confidence with all the resources being dedicated to vaccine
development and therapeutics and testing capacity. I'm an optimist that in time, the health risks will be
successfully mitigated and managed. I believe that the world will return to some post coronavirus form of
normal, and that means economic activity, it means growth, it means travel. The pace and the patterns at
which that reemerges, I think, are still open to a wide range of views. And I don't know that anybody can
predict that exactly.
But when you translate that back to our industry, I think it plays into some things that we have long
believed, which is low-cost of supply matters. Operational excellence and discipline in project execution
matters. Capital discipline matters. Cost discipline matters. And all of those things will become very
apparent as we recover in some form with inventory length in the market, with OPEC production off and
with the opportunity for shale and tight to come back in relatively rapidly.
And so I think the term lower for longer has been used for a while to describe conditions. I think that is
even more appropriate today than it has been in past times when it's been used. I think we need to be
very focused on efficient use of every one of our resources to operate well and to drive the cost of supply
down in a world that looks like it will be pretty well supplied.
So you get to the Gulf of Mexico, and the Gulf of Mexico has been resetting its cost structure to compete
in a world like this. I think it means we've got more work to do to make the Gulf of Mexico compete even
more, more focus on tiebacks, infill drilling, utilizing existing infrastructure and finding efficient ways
to develop in the Gulf of Mexico. And so that trend is one that we need to stay on. We've made a lot of
progress. And I think there's more work to be done there.

continue to improve. And so well costs come down, drilling efficiency improves, completion design and
execution improves. And the hydrocarbons haven't gone away. The rocks don't go bankrupt. Companies
might, but the rocks won't. And I think that that's a resource that will continue to be very important in the
overall supply picture, and certainly, it will be for our company.
And so we'll look to invest in the very best projects. We'll look to acquire assets and opportunities, be they
through exploration or other means that will compete in our portfolio and continue to be attractive in a
world where low cost of supply and the ability to generate good returns matter.
So in some ways, those fundamentals are only more important going forward than they have been, Paul.
And beyond that, I think it's speculation on a lot of the other things you hear people talk about.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Paul. Okay. So we're going to pull an audible here. I've actually got Doug Leggate's questions
keyed up. He had trouble dialing back in, so he texted me his questions, Mike, and I'm going to feed them
to you that way. So the first one was for Mike. Shell thinks the whole industry needs a reset, a change in
long-term supply, et cetera. They just cut the dividend to adapt. What do you think of the big picture at
this point? And then the second one will be for Pierre.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Look, I think everybody is -- it's interesting, Doug, and apologies, we couldn't get you on the phone
directly. I wish we could have the conversation directly. I think we've actually seen more of a divergence
in strategies and thinking among companies in our industry over the last few years than we have in a
long time. And everybody's got a slightly different take on where they're going and where their strengths
are. And so I can't speak for another company. I will just tell you, it's very similar to what I was saying in
response to Paul Sankey's question.
I think the companies that can be reliable, efficient, low-cost providers will continue to have a very strong
position as leaders in our industry. And the world is not ready to transition to another source of energy in
large part anytime soon. And so the resumption of economic growth will require the sources of energy that
we know today and that fuel the world today. And there will be a need for what we do. And I think you
have to be very honest with yourself about where you're good and where you're not, and you've got to
focus on improving and closing gaps where you need to improve and getting even better where you have
strengths.
So again, it kind of gets back to the fundamentals, capital discipline, cost discipline, project execution and
the ability -- and I'll say it, if we haven't said it clearly enough, your balance sheet is a great asset. And
oftentimes, we think of our upstream or downstream assets as the most important assets, and they're
very, very important in our business. The balance sheet is also a very important asset. You have to treat it
with a priority. You have to be prepared for the day when you need to rely on that asset. And I think that
also becomes very, very important as we move forward. We've been prudent in the way we've managed
that. We were positioned differently than others as we went into this. And I think you can see, as I said,
while we wouldn't have predicted this exact market scenario, we were prepared for an environment like
this, and we will navigate our way through it with our shareholders in mind. Second question?
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Yes. Second question is around cash CapEx. Of the $14 billion guide, how much of that is cash CapEx, and
how much further can that go down without impeding cash flow and production?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
Yes. So again, sorry, Doug, we can't get you on. So that $9.3 billion is the cash CapEx equivalent to
$14 billion. So it was $10.5 billion at $16 billion, so it went down. $1.2 billion of the $2 billion additional
reduction is in cash capital. I think Mike has addressed it, I addressed it with sustaining CapEx. Again,
at the CapEx levels and to Jeanine's question, when we're at $12 billion, when you back out reduced
downstream and exploration, we are below the level to sustain short-term production. And again, that's a
deliberate decision because there's not a lot of value in putting capital that results in production at current
prices.
We are investing, and I should have said to Jeanine's answer, although we're below the $10 billion, let's
call it, sustaining capital on base and shale and tight, which will cause some decline, we are investing in
TCO FGP-WPMP, which will come on in 2022 and 2023 and provide that kind of long-term value. So again,
the choices that Mike and the leadership team are making are really balancing the short term and the long
term and being thoughtful about where the capital reductions are and where the capital investments are.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Doug, for your questions.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.
Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division
Along the lines of what you said about the energy transition not being as realistic perhaps as what a lot
of folks are saying, your CO2 targets assumed a pre-COVID production rate. Given that across-the-board
volumes will be coming down, are you looking to upsize those decarbonization targets that you put out
last summer?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Pavel, it's interesting, everybody in the industry has defined their targets just a little bit differently.
And we haven't actually put out absolute targets, which you would expect absolute greenhouse gas
emissions to come down if people are restricting activity. We put out intensity targets, so greenhouse gas
emissions per unit of production. We got a target for barrel of oil in the upstream, we had a target for gas
production. And then we've got flaring and methane emission targets. All of which are unit targets that
drive down unit emissions. And so we have not reset those.
We would expect that we will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions irrespective of COVID or
any of these other circumstances. These are commitments we've made. We've tied people's compensation
to them, and we intend to continue to reduce our emissions footprint.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And just the other -- to add, the other distinction is that we've done it on an equity basis. So whether we
operate or don't operate, our whole -- all the barrels or all the Mcfs are in those intensity metrics that Mike
talked about, not just our operated barrels.
Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James Ltd., Research Division
Quick question, Michael, if I may. Is there any change in the historical linkage between Asian LNG prices
and Brent crude given what's happened in the last 60 days?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
Pavel, the contracts have not changed. And of course, we sell most of our volume on contract. Our
contracts typically are linked to -- not linked to Brent directly, but linked to JCC or Japanese Crude
Cocktail. Another one is linked to JKM index, which is a gas-related index. So I think commodity prices
have some sympathetic relationship with one another, but they're not always perfectly correlated. And so I
think you would certainly say that our crude-linked contracts will reflect crude prices.
And to the extent Brent has come off, eventually, our crude-linked contracts will reflect that. They tend to
be on a lagged basis. And so they don't always reflect current month pricing. But broadly speaking, yes,
you'll see a connection between those 2.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore.
Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Mike, you guys were an early power adopter of the disciplined capital management model, and that has
obviously serve your shareholders well during the upturn and now the downturn, too. So first, kudos to
you guys for that. And then to the point about industry stress I think Paul and Paul brought up earlier,
which often lead to consolidation, my question is that while financial benefits are often available on a
variety of transactions, strategic benefits on the scale that you guys received from Gulf and Texaco and
Unocal back in the day may or may not be this time around. And so I wanted to see if you'd frame the
strategic condition today, how you think it's similar or different from prior downturns given your history.
And also any other notable color or philosophy that you want to share on this topic?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So I guess if you go back all the way to Gulf, and that takes you back to the '80s, the industry was
highly fragmented even amongst the largest players. And so there were, as you say, financial benefits of
consolidation, and there were strategic benefits as you brought together portfolios that had gaps in them.
And we certainly saw that with Gulf. We saw it again with Texaco.
I think today, we've got fewer large players. And so the impact of any single transaction that is not
amongst large players, and those are pretty hard to do as you get down to small numbers, they're less
profound, both from a financial standpoint, simply because you don't have the same scale that you're
consolidating, and it flows through to the asset portfolios. And so the players that -- like ourselves and our
big peers have exposure to many basins around the world to all segments of the value chain. And I think
everybody has worked to try to optimize their portfolios in a way that they think fits with their strategy.
And so I think your point is a good one. You can do kind of rifle shots that would be maybe smaller
bore both on the financial and the strategic dimension that could fill in nicely. But things that would be
transformative the way we saw back around the '99, 2000 period, I think you're right, I think that's a
lot harder to envision today. And everybody has become more efficient and so even the synergies that
we saw back then -- technology was different. Information technology was different. Productivity was
different. And so I think competition has made everybody sharper and more efficient, and so those
financial synergies are harder to capture.
We're going to -- Jonathan, we're going to keep going a little bit past the top of the hour since we had the
problem, which seems to be resolved now. So let's -- we'll be sure we can spend a little more time getting
the questions.
Operator
Absolutely. Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC.

Can you hear me?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We sure can, Biraj.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Awesome. So I'll get at my 2 questions just in case. But the first one is on the Permian and the shut-ins
economics. I guess you mentioned that 50% of the curtailment is in the U.S., and then most of that is the
Permian. I was wondering if you could talk about the process on how you got to the number you're looking
to curtail and why that is the appropriate number for the environment that you see. That would be the
first question.
And then second question is on the -- on your CapEx reduction. Obviously, part of this is economics, but
there's another element which is not necessarily choice. So you mentioned slowing down in Tengiz. I was
wondering if there's an element of the CapEx or if you could quantify the element of CapEx that is simply
CapEx that you couldn't spend even if you wanted to, for logistical reasons or otherwise. Just trying to get
a sense of that would be helpful.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Okay. Well, on Permian curtailment, we've -- as we've said, we've pulled capital down significantly.
So we're not putting capital in to bring new production online. And as you look at flowing production,
not every barrel is created equally. We've got some older vertical wells, for instance, that in this kind of
an environment have pretty marginal economics. We would look at those. We've got barrels that have
a different oil/gas ratio. We would look at that. We look at netbacks, logistics and value chain cash flow,
storage cost, future prices, a whole host of things. And then as I mentioned earlier, the desire to avoid a
future need for abrupt shut-ins if we were to see logistics and flow curtailed.
So there are a series of things that we've got a team looking at across the entire basin and factoring
into decisions that we think are prudent decisions from a value standpoint and an operating standpoint.
And it's a moving target. We -- actually, this is something that our senior leadership team is involved in
multiple times a week. And so the models to do this to understand markets and to stay really in touch with
markets to be sure we're making good decisions continue to be informed by new information. And so it's a
very dynamic process that we're engaged in right now.
On the capital side, on the kind of nondiscretionary, not-our-choice capital, Pierre, can you take that?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. I think the vast majority are decisions and choices we're making, but it gets into how you define it.
For example, in Tengiz, we're choosing to demob the noncritical path project personnel. But clearly, that
is COVID-related. So I don't know if you call that a choice. We have a crisis management team that is
overseeing supply chains and the whole system, but the bottom line is the vast majority are decisions that
we are making. In some cases with partners, we're seeing -- in almost all cases, partners are very aligned
on actions that we're taking.
Now we do have some currency effects, right? So the dollar is stronger. So there is part of the capital
reduction, it's also very modest, that's a reflection of currency effects. But I would look at the vast
majority of the 30% reduction as being choices that we're making to flex capital, pace capital, defer
capital that is largely driven by our decisions to balance cash flow and long-term value.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen.

Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Can everybody hear me?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We can, Sam.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
All right. So I'll just ask sort of a focused question. We've gone over a lot of high-level stuff. But because
of your downstream footprint, you have a pretty good look into Asia. Some other operators have been
talking about some interesting observations they've made about the timing disparity between Asia
emerging from the COVID crisis versus the rest of the world and kind of using it as maybe a soft proxy
around the slope that demand might recover or what that might look like on the other side of this. Could
you share whatever observations or thoughts you have around what you're seeing?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Sam, there's a great quote from Lee Kuan Yew that Asia is a figment of the Western imagination, he
said. It was more of a cultural quote. But it's -- Asia is a big area is the reason I bring that up. And what's
happening in China is different than what's happening in Indonesia right now. And what's happening in
South Korea is different than what's happening in Thailand. And so broadly speaking, I would say, Asia and
other parts of the world, it would appear that demand has found a bottom and that we're kind of bumping
along the bottom right now.
And the biggest hit has been on aviation fuels. And then you've got gasoline, which is off 50%, give or
take, around most of the world; diesel, more like 25%. And so these numbers generally hold in most of
the places where we're doing business right now, and then you have regional signals and signs that things
are starting to move. China clearly has come off the bottom. Some other markets in Asia that have seen
kind of a second wave and they've reinstituted some of these lockdown type policies, the green shoots
seem to have pulled back a little bit.
So I would say it's highly specific to the market in Asia, where you are, but there are certainly signs in
a number of markets of a resumption of activity and a resumption of demand growth. And they tend to
correlate pretty well with when the policies are relaxed and people can begin to get back to work and start
to move around again. And so I think there are small positive signals.
We had a meeting earlier this week where we talked about it being not the beginning of the end but the
end of the beginning. I think it feels like we're finding the bottom right now. And then the path up out of
this is likely to be different in different regions of the world as it ties to the health status in those parts
of the world. But I think this quarter and perhaps next quarter feel like we're about in the -- as I said,
bumping along the bottom and going to begin to emerge out of it here at some point over that time.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Todd from Simmons Energy.

Simmons & Company International, Research Division

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
Loud and clear, Ryan.
Ryan M. Todd
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. Maybe a couple of quick ones. The $2 billion of additional CapEx cuts, on the fuzzy chart, it looks
like it's coming from -- kind of spread across all businesses. Any additional color on where the cuts are
coming from? And in the Permian, I think the exit rate at the end of the year was still the same. So maybe
any thoughts on how we think of the trajectory there in the Permian? And then I have one follow-up.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the $2 billion broadly, you can think about a little bit less than $1 billion coming out of major
capital projects, and that's primarily TCO. So we'd already factored in a little bit of reduction in TCO in
the first reduction down to 16 but not nearly as much as we're seeing now. So call it $800 million or so
on major capital projects; about $0.5 billion each on unconventionals and on other base business and the
unconventionals would include not only Permian, but also Argentina and Canada; and then about another
$200 million coming out of downstream and chemicals. So I think if you take those and rack them up, that
gets you to the $2 billion.
On the Permian, our guidance still is that we'll exit the year at roughly the level that we came in or
125,000 barrels lower than what we had initially indicated if you were to look at the chart we used at the
Investor Day meeting. And notwithstanding the fact that we're seeing some curtailments there and we're
pulling back on the rigs, the momentum coming into the year has been strong.
And Permian production growth in the first quarter, which largely reflects wells that were put on production
last year -- and we had more pops in the second half of the year than we did in the first half of the year.
First quarter Permian production was strong. And so that will peak out here over the middle part of the
year and come back off as the effects of the capital reductions and the curtailments roll through the
system. But our expectation is that we'll exit roughly where we entered, which is about 125,000 less than
the numbers we showed you in early March.
Ryan M. Todd
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Maybe -- sorry, could I just...
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
You've hung in here, you get a follow-up.
Ryan M. Todd
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Great. Maybe one -- I know there's a huge amount of uncertainty right now, it's clear, but maybe
thoughts on implications as we think of the recovery coming out of this. And in a very specific sense, on
curtailments, what's the signal? Is it clearly just -- is it just netback price that will drive the resumption of
those volumes, at least on the ones that you operate and control? And then as we think about the budget,
as we move out of the current level of spend and you start to work your way back towards maybe the $20
billion level that we were in before, I mean, how do you -- what are the sort of signals that you see that
will, I guess, first, allow you to turn on curtailed volumes and then allow you to put rigs back to work in
the Permian?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So on the first one on curtailment, I would say there are going to be market signals around the
economic value of those barrels. And netbacks will be an important part of that. We will also -- because

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL | MAY 01, 2020
we can pull some of these things through the value chain, into markets, we can -- what export markets
look like, what our -- we've got a refinery that we pull some of our Permian production into, so refining
margins and the value chain opportunities will play into our thinking there as well. So we look at these
things across the entire value chain. But it will be an economic signal that says these barrels are being
called for by the market and the contribution is more positive.
In terms of the capital spending, those are longer cycle decisions than curtailments. And I think you can
expect us to be thoughtful and not rush capital back into the market prematurely. But it will be our view
on where markets are headed. So curtailments is kind of more or less where markets are or where they're
likely to be in the relative short term. Capital spending is going to be more of a medium-term kind of a
view. And it's because this flexible asset class, we don't need to really look at the long-term signal, and we
always factor that in. But the medium term, given the production profile on each individual unconventional
well, we'll be looking at signals that suggest that that's strengthening and that the demand is there. And
you're going to watch OPEC, you're going to watch inventories. There's a whole series of indicators, I
think, that will help us inform decision-making there.
I think we have one more question in the queue.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
No. I think -- no. Actually, I think -- I apologize, it was Jason Gabelman, and it looks like he dropped

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator
today. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. Our
Chairman and CEO, Mike Wirth; and CFO, Pierre Breber, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the slides
that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Now I'll turn it over to Mike.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thanks, Wayne. Last March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment, focused on
4 elements that differentiate Chevron from its competitors: an advantaged portfolio; a resilience to price
downside; the commitment to capital discipline; and a superior capacity to return cash to shareholders.
And as we've done in the past, we delivered again in 2019.
We generated over $27 billion in cash flow from operations. We executed our $20 billion capital program.
We grew annual production to a record high. We continued to high grade our portfolio, and we further
strengthened our industry-leading balance sheet.
As a result, earlier this week, we increased the dividend by more than 8%, and we expect to sustain
the increased share buyback rate of $5 billion per year going forward. And we did this despite the cost
increase at TCO and the fourth quarter impairments, which Pierre will cover in just a minute.
2019 performance delivered on all 4 of our financial priorities, which I'll cover on the next slide. These
priorities don't change. They've been the same for a long time. For 2 years in a row, we simultaneously
increased our dividend, increased share repurchases, grew production and reduced debt. Not everyone
can say this. You can see the sources and uses of cash on the slide, including the $13 billion returned to
shareholders, nearly the same amount as our cash CapEx.
2019 was a good year, and we intend to do even better. During our Analyst Day in March, we'll lay out our
plans to further improve performance in order to continue to deliver superior returns to shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierre, who will discuss our 2019 financial results. Pierre?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter results included a net $9.2 billion charge in special items
and a foreign exchange loss of $256 million. Excluding special items and FX, earnings were $2.8 billion or
$1.49 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 4
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. This is lower than the prior quarter, in part, due to higher
taxes on repatriated cash, including the cash impact for the $430 million tax charge that was accrued in
the third quarter.
Total capital spending was $21 billion. This includes around $800 million of inorganic spend, which
we don't budget primarily relating to the purchase of the Pasadena refinery and acquisition cost for
exploration leases and additional working interest in El Trapial.
Return on capital employed was about 7% when adjusted for special items and FX. We're committed to
improving returns on capital, and we'll share more about our plans to do so at our Analyst Day in March.
Importantly, our strong free cash flow enabled us to pay over $2 billion in dividends and repurchase an
additional $1.25 billion in shares in the quarter. As Mike mentioned earlier, for the full year, we returned
$13 billion in dividends and share buybacks to our shareholders, and we end the year with a stronger
balance sheet and the lowest debt ratio among our peers.
Turning to Slide 6. In the fourth quarter, we recorded over $10 billion in impairments and write-offs.
These were triggered in December by our decision to reduce funding to various gas-related opportunities
and to lower our long-term oil and gas price outlook. Line item detail is available in the appendix. While
we're disappointed by these charges, we're confident that we're making the right decisions to prioritize
our capital on our most advantaged, highest-return assets. These charges were partially offset by a $1.2
billion gain from our U.K. asset sale.
Turning to Slide 7. Excluding the impact of special items and FX, earnings decreased $3.6 billion in 2019
compared to the prior year. Upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower commodity prices, partially
offset by higher liftings. Downstream earnings also were down due to lower refining chemical margins,
together with lower volumes, due primarily from the Southern Africa divestment. The Other segment
charge, adjusted for special items and FX, was modestly higher, but in line with full year guidance of $2.4
billion.
On Slide 8, 2019 production was a record 3.06 million barrels per day, an increase of over 100,000
barrels a day or more than 4% from 2018. Excluding the impact of 2019 asset sales, production grew
by 5.4%, right in the middle of our 4% to 7% guidance range. Shale and tight production primarily in
the Permian, and the ramp-up of Wheatstone and other major capital projects increased production by
235,000 barrels per day. This growth was partially offset by base decline and the impact of asset sales
primarily in Denmark and the U.K.
Turning to Slide 9 and our reserve replacements. In 2019, our 1-year reserve replacement ratio was 44%.
Our decision to reduce capital funding to Appalachia natural gas resulted in a negative revision of about
400 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves, and asset sales reduced reserves by another 100 million
BOE. Adjusting for these 2 items, reserve replacement was around 90%.
Annual reserve replacements are lumpy by their nature. 5-year reserve replacement ratios are more
meaningful, and ours is 106%, highlighting our continued focus and sustainability to replace the proved
reserves that we produce over the longer term.
Moving to Slide 10. Slide 10 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, we acquired an
additional 15% working interest in the El Trapial field in Argentina, giving us 100% ownership of the
conventional production and the unconventional potential in this block.
We also recently announced an agreement to acquire terminals and retail sites in Australia, allowing us to
further integrate our refinery production in Asia with a strong retail network after the deal closes.
Late last year, we also signed agreements to sell our interest in our upstream assets in Azerbaijan and
Colombia. Both transactions are expected to close in the first half of this year.
And a few weeks ago, we joined the Hydrogen Council, building on our knowledge and experience with
hydrogen and our commitment to explore ever cleaner energy solutions for the future.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike.

Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Thanks, Pierre.
On Slide 11, we're maintaining our commitment to capital discipline. And in 2020, our capital budget will
be flat for the third consecutive year. The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget of $20 billion, which
includes more than $6 billion in expenditures by affiliates primarily TCO, CPChem and GS Caltex.
In the 2020 budget, approximately $5 billion is allocated to our upstream base business, $4 billion to
FGP-WPMP, another $4 billion to Permian development, $3 billion for downstream and chemicals and the
remainder goes to other MCPs, exploration, and other projects.
Chevron's capital program is unlike our peers. Our spend profile has low execution risk, and is focused
primarily on short-cycle, high-return investments that are expected to sustain and grow the enterprise for
many years to come.
Slide 12 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to
be up to 3% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2020 asset sales. Our projected growth is
largely driven by the Permian, partially offset by ordinary base declines and the effects of prior year asset
sales. The range reflects key areas of uncertainty in our business, as noted on the slide.
After another year of record production in 2019, we expect a fourth consecutive year of production
growth, excluding the impact of potential 2020 asset sales.
Moving to Slide 13, I'll share a few closing thoughts. As I've mentioned before, we intend to win in
any environment. We're not making excuses for tough commodity prices or margins. As a result of our
advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, low execution risk and financial strength, we're well positioned
for 2020 and committed to maintain organic capital spending at $20 billion and return significant cash to
shareholders through our dividend and buybacks.
More detailed guidance related to the first quarter and full year is in the appendix.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Wayne.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
For the first question, and this might be one for you, Pierre, is cash flow in the quarter -- earnings look
good. Cash flow, a little light. It did seem like there were some one-timers in there. So can you just spend
some time talking about what some of those onetime items are and how should we think about that rolling
off as we go into the next quarter?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Neil. So yes, cash flow was a little light perhaps. In the third quarter, we did provide guidance
that we expected to pay the taxes on the repatriated cash. So if you recall, in the third quarter, we
accrued in our P&L for that tax effect on repatriating cash, but the cash taxes weren't actually paid until
the fourth quarter, when in fact you saw the cash move. So you saw cash balances go down by -- from
over $10 billion to less than $6 billion at year-end.
And then the second item I would cite was lower affiliate dividends. So we had lower dividends from our
chemicals affiliates, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, and no TCO dividend in 2019. So at times in
years past, TCO -- we received a dividend from TCO in the fourth quarter, and we didn't have that last
year.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Great. And the follow-up is just on production guidance. Up to 3% and there are a number of variables
that you called out there. But can you talk a little bit more about how you think about volumes in 2020?
What are some of the pluses and minuses that we should be focused on? And how should we should think
about -- thinking about some of the timing of those elements, recognizing that you're solving for value
over volume?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Neil, I'll take that one. We've had, as I mentioned, 3 years of production growth, 7%, I think 2 years
ago; 4.5% last year; 5.5% without asset sales. We continue to be on a good, strong program in our
upstream that's delivering volume growth and, as we said, up to 3%. This year, the Permian is the biggest
piece of that. And you can see over the course of 2019 what we delivered. And we're at, what I would call,
full factory production mode right now in the Permian. And so that machine continues to click along very
well. Jay will talk more about that, including not only kind of the near-term view, but lay out, I think, a
little bit of a longer-term view for you in March.
We've got contributions from other shale and tight, where we continue to invest in both Canada and
Argentina, and those are beginning to contribute not at the same magnitude as the Permian, but,
certainly, strong growth; Gorgon and Wheatstone, through improved reliability and addressing constraints
and optimization within the LNG plants. So we've got growth coming across a number of those.
And as you note there, we've got some uncertainties on the PZ. It looks as if we will begin production
there here at some point over the next few months. There's still some details being worked out on that,
but that starts to come back in. Hard to say how things go in Venezuela, really difficult to say right now.
And then the other one, of course, is nonoperated joint ventures. And we certainly have some
expectations for activity there. How that trends with funding levels, decisions by partners, et cetera, a

little hard to predict. But look, we're going to -- we expect to grow production again this year, as I said,
setting aside if we do anything else with asset sales in the portfolio.
And fundamentally, the underlying drivers that we laid out last March, where we set a 3% to 4%
compound annual growth rate over the next 5 years, those drivers remain intact.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
The first question here. Others -- some of your peers seem to be signaling a retrenchment in buybacks,
need to protect balance sheets. Obviously, you've talked about the strength of your balance sheet and a
willingness to continue the $5 billion buyback here in 2020, despite the big increase in the dividend earlier
this week. So as you look at that, I mean is there any reasonable scenario where you would think it would
not make sense to do the buyback from a macro perspective? Or is this something that -- I know a year
ago, when you put this in place, the idea was it would stay there through most reasonable cycles? So just
your latest thoughts on that.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Phil, it's Mike. No change in our expectations there. We -- we've indicated and we increased the
buyback last year. If you look at our cash flow, you can see that we certainly can afford this. As Pierre
mentioned, debt came down again last year and we have the capacity to see this through cycles, which is
what our intent is. And no change to that guidance at all.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And if I can just build off that and address Neil's question on fourth quarter cash flow. But if you look
at full year cash flow, it was very strong. Again, we paid a higher 6% dividend per share in 2019, covered
that. We fully funded our capital program and grew production, as Mike said, over 4%. We paid down
more than $7 billion of debt. And in 2019, we bought back $4 billion of shares. So we're exiting the year
confident on our ability to generate future cash. We -- that was expressed with the 8.4% dividend increase
and, again, this expectation of sustaining the buyback through the cycle.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Great. Mike, second question, just a follow-up would be it sounds like you've been doubling down
here on cost reduction efforts, and it's been a big focus for you recently. So it would be helpful if you
could talk about what's been happening lately on that front. Do you see this as something that would be
material to investors in terms of Chevron's ability to reduce costs in the upstream and/or downstream
businesses in the way that we could see?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Phil. So I may sound like a broken record on this, but in a capital-intensive business, capital discipline
always matters. And in a commodity business, cost discipline always matters. We've done a good job in
taking costs out of our business over the last several years in response to the downturn we saw earlier last
decade.
You can never assume that you're done when it comes to seeking efficiency and driving to an even more
efficient cost structure. And so that is certainly my expectation is we're going to continue to look for ways
to do that.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
We've taken costs down at the same time as production has grown significantly over the last number of
years, and so unit costs have come down dramatically. And my expectation is we're going to continue to
look for ways to reduce both absolute costs and unit costs over time. In March, we'll lay out a little more
specifically what some of our ambitions are, and these are the kinds of things you could -- can expect to
see.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Another solid year in terms of execution in the Permian. I was hoping that you could address whether
you still see the Permian as on target for being able to be essentially free cash flow positive. The capital
budget ticked up a small amount for 2020, and I know commodity prices have some influence there. But if
you could just talk about what you're seeing.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jason. The short answer to that is yes, we do. We fully expect to be cash flow positive in the Permian
this year. We exited the fourth quarter with very strong production if you look at the growth Q3 to Q4. And
across all the metrics, we continue to see improved performance. We're getting more feet drilled per rig
every year. Lateral lengths are increasing. EURs continue to go up. Development costs continue to come
down. And we are becoming more efficient from both the capital and an operating cost standpoint. You put
all that together with the royalty barrels and the benefit of the fee acreage that we hold, and the picture in
the Permian looks as strong as it ever has. I mean it just gets better.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Great. And then just as a follow-up, and this may be something that you prefer to largely defer to March.
But a lot of your European peers are putting a fairly significant amount of capital into businesses that they
call low carbon, which generally look to be relatively low rate of return type of investments. Can you talk
about, within Chevron, how you think about lowering the overall carbon footprint of your portfolio and
whether these are the types of investments that make sense for you?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
So let me start with lowering our carbon footprint, and then I'll come to investments, Jason. We absolutely
are committed to lowering the carbon intensity of our operations. Last year, we announced 2 metrics tied
to methane emissions and flaring that are driving significant changes in what we do. We have adopted 2
additional metrics, which I expect to also be included in compensation related to carbon intensity of oil
production and gas production. We are doing a lot of work around marginal abatement cost curves across
our entire portfolio to look at the intersection of technology, investment and opportunity to reduce our
carbon footprint.
We're integrating renewables into our business in a much greater way with green power purchase
agreements, feeding biofeedstocks in our refineries as soon as this year and co-developing renewable
natural gas projects with dairy farmers, for instance.
And then the final thing is we are investing in technologies, looking for things that can scale up, that can
provide solutions to the -- these challenges. And this includes not only things like carbon capture from
ambient air, but other things to try to decarbonize the more difficult sectors where energy intensity is
high.
Last thing I'll say is, just to remind you, that we operate the largest on-purpose carbon capture and
storage project on the planet at Gorgon. And we have 2 of the trains running right now. The third will

start up this year. That will, at full capacity, be sequestering 3.5 million to 4 million tons per year. So we're
absolutely committed to finding ways to address the climate issue.
When it comes to investments, it can be challenging because the returns, as you say, historically, have not
been competitive with some of the other things that we invest in our portfolio. We're looking for ways to
improve that and find things that we can invest in that would offer attractive returns for investors, also be
good for the environment and that, importantly, can scale. And this is a big challenge, and we need things
that we can do at scale. And so we continue to be committed to that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jeanine Wai from Barclays.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
I think just following up on that question, last month, Mike, you were quoted by saying that companies
that wait until change is forced upon them fail. And we were just wondering, are those comments
specifically related to the gas write-downs and Chevron's longer-term view on natural gas versus liquids?
Or was it more broadly speaking to Chevron's strategy related to the energy transition or else -- just
something else?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Probably the final, the ""something else."" And it really is we need to continue to adapt. And our company
has been around for more than 140 years, and we have reinvented ourselves many times over that period
of time.
We live in a world today with 7.5 billion people. 20 years from now, there will be more than 9 billion
people on the planet. There's an expectation for a reduction in the impact of what we do. And at the
same time, we need to support affordable, reliable access to energy for a growing population, a growing
standard of living.
Now we also have technology tools that are available today that we've never seen before. And so what
we need to do is continue to evolve our culture, our applications of technology, our cost structure, our
competitiveness and our discipline to be part of that equation for many, many decades into the future.
And so my comments really are a message to our employees that we need to change, we need to evolve,
and it addresses all of the things that we've talked about. It addresses a more efficient and lower carbon
intensity in our operations, but it also calls for us to find ways to adopt new technologies and change the
way we work in response to them.
Jeanine Wai
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Great. That's very helpful. My second question is on the Gulf of Mexico and potential upside to medium-
term growth there, especially post 2023. So with tiebacks to existing infrastructure there being very
attractive from a rate of return perspective in the portfolio, can you talk about any technology that you're
working on that could potentially extend tieback ranges?
And then any update you might have on estimated resource that we can be excited about in terms of
exploiting through existing facilities or infrastructure given the continued focus on free cash flow?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we -- we've sanctioned projects at the end of the year, which is a greenfield project with Anchor
at a much lower cost structure, both capital cost and operating cost, than we've seen before. So I think
when we find projects where that's the right answer, you'll continue to see us do that. And we've got a lot
of exploration acreage out there and a good track record over time on exploration.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
But the concept of tiebacks, I think is one that we need to continue to invest more in. We had a discovery
last year with Hess as the operator called Esox, a low-cost, high return tieback, which actually will turn
a 2019 discovery into 2020 first oil. It's about 5 miles away from Tubular Bells. We've been working on
technology to extend subsea tiebacks, and this includes longer distance pumping of fluids, compression
and movement of liquids and the ability to avoid formation of hydrates and other things on the sea floor,
pushing the range of tiebacks from the neighborhood of 30 miles out closer to 50 miles. And that really
expands the opportunity set for us to use existing infrastructure to improve production. We're working on
multiphase subsea pumps and -- in a number of these technologies.
And so I think, as we go forward, what you will see is an increased blend of tiebacks and use of existing
infrastructure as well as the occasional large greenfield project that comes in.
And things like Anchor, for instance, you've got an initial phase of development. And once that's in,
that enables what we've just -- what I just described, which is these additional follow-on phases of
development, which are much more economic. And I think technology just moves in one direction, and it
really builds on my prior comments that we need to look for ways to use technology standardization and
other approaches to make the deepwater even more economic. A lot of progress has been made on that,
and I'm optimistic we'll see more in the future.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Guess, if we could, I've got kind of one that's maybe on the risk side question and one that's on the
upside question. So with the good news first. You highlighted some of the things that are risks to 2020
production. But recent talk has been about restarting the neutral zone. You have a position there. And
then I was curious where else we could see some upside in the portfolio in 2020. I mean should we be
thinking Permian? Or should we focus on some other portion of the operations?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Roger. So on the Partitioned Zone, after several years of being shut down, there's been progress with
an agreement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. That memorandum of understanding has
now been ratified by the Royal Court in the Kingdom and the parliament in Kuwait. And we're moving on
to some administrative actions required to implement that.
All of that suggests that we should resume work in the PZ this year. It's been shut in since May of 2015.
And so we will be careful to ensure that any start-up and resumption of activity is safe, that we really
focus on equipment integrity. And so it will be a careful restart and a gradual ramp. And so I think, in
terms of production this year, we're likely to see a start-up at some point and then some work before we
begin a gradual ramp. So what that nets to is not a lot of impact this year. But it could be some positive
upside. I think we'll see more of the ramp completed in 2021. We eventually will have to get some new
rigs in there to begin drilling additional wells. And so -- but it should be on a trend line over the next 18
months or so back towards something that looks like we saw before we shut down.
In terms of other upside, the Permian has kind of continually surprised us to the upside, even as we raise
expectations in the past. And so certainly, that is a possibility. I mentioned the other shale and tight, and
those also continue to really show strong improvement in terms of performance. And so I think those are
some other areas where you could see production upside.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. And then for my bucket of cold water on you. We've seen global natural gas prices take quite a hit,
obviously, fairly mild winter across Northern Hemisphere hasn't helped. But part of it is your own LNG
facilities and everyone else continues to run better than expected. Or we've seen some start to run above

nameplate capacity. And so as we think about gas in 2020, what -- do you feel that as we look at North
American forward curves, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the year ahead? Or is there a reason
for optimism in one place or greater pessimism in another? Just sort of curious how that would fit into
your outlook.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Overall, Roger, I think the market is, as you say, pretty tempered on gas pricing. And we have had a
relatively mild winter, both in North America and in Asia. And forward markets reflect that inventory levels
reflects that. We're not banking on a recovery in gas prices. We've got an under -- we're underweight
gas as a percentage of our portfolio versus others. And I'll remind you, we've got pretty good term
contracting on our LNG with oil-linked pricing across a lot of our portfolio there. So from a relative
weighting standpoint, we may not be quite as exposed. So maybe it was a bucket of cool water rather
than ice water that you dumped on me there. But yes, the markets are setting up, I think, to be pretty
flattish. And that's why we've got to focus on self-help and things like costs, as I discussed earlier.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.
Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Mike, so integrated oil returns on capital have converged between the companies during the past decade
or so which suggests that competitive advantages may be converging, too. And on this point, while you
guys have this mantra of disciplined returns-driven capital allocation, and that's clearly the appropriate
approach, at least in my view, my question is whether you think that historical advantages in project
management, multinational experience, technological superiority, cost of capital, I may be leaving
something out, are still strong and defendable for Chevron. And if so are there examples that underscore
the strength of the advantages that you guys have?
And on the other hand, are there areas of historical competitive advantage that you sense are being
eroded and where you'll need to redeploy capital away from in the future?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, there's a lot in there, Doug. Number one, you're right. I think we have seen this convergence of
returns, in part by the last cycle we came through in high prices. We had a high-cost structure. We had
a lot of investment across the industry. And we are now living in a world of more abundant supply, and
prices and returns reflect that with the capital sitting on the books of everybody.
I do believe the advantages that have historically been associated with companies like ours are still strong.
And the project at Tengiz, while we wish that the execution was going better than it is and disappointed in
the cost and schedule update, there are not many companies in the world that can do a project like that
at all. And so I think there are strong advantages there. Our sour gas handling capabilities, our heavy oil
expertise continues to be of value. And as we get back to work in the PZ, we will be doing things there
that very few other companies can do.
And as I mentioned earlier, we've been hanging in, in Venezuela, which has tremendous potential. And
our capability there to help, over time, develop that resource in a responsible way is something that is
differentiated. So I think there are some historic capabilities that are differentiators.
The other thing I would point to is portfolio. And certainly, as we've talked about many times, I won't
belabor it, but our position in the Permian, both from a size standpoint, a quality standpoint, the lack of
-- relative lack of royalty given the fact it's fee acreage and our experience with factory drilling, which is a
capability that not everybody has, and we continue to see the benefits of that year after year, is another
point of differentiation. So I still do believe there are areas that we do differentiate.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And if I could build up Mike's answer there. Look, we get -- and I said in my prepared remarks that
our returns are too low, and we're committed to improving them, and we'll share more at our Analyst
Day. But I'll also talk about cash flow. We talked about our strong cash flow in 2019 and, call it, whichever
macro environment you want to call it, a week or whatever, but we're able to do all those things, increase
the dividend, fund the capital program, grow production, reduce debt and sustain the buyback program. At
our last Analyst Day, we showed that over the next 5 years, we're going to grow cash from ops. We said
we're going to keep capital essentially flat. That means we're going to grow free cash flow.
And so I think one of the things that's not fully understood is that the capital efficiency of our program
going forward is different than we've seen in the past. So we're able to grow and sustain cash flows at
lower capital than almost any time in the past and certainly better than our peers. And that's what enables
us to do the kind of dividend increase that we announced a couple of days ago, sustain a buyback program
and still grow the enterprise for the long term.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
My -- you did an impairment charge, which is quite large. And obviously, that means the decision made
at the time, some of the parameter did not work out. So what have we learned from this process or this
impairment and how your future M&A or project sanctions process has changed?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Paul, 2 of the big drivers of that charge were our Marcellus position, which is essentially mostly dry
gas. We've got a little bit of Utica, but mostly dry gas. And also the Kitimat LNG project, which is Canadian
gas, that is quite a ways away from the Kitimat site. And both of those, at the time those transactions
were entered into, we and the world had a different view on natural gas.
I think the Permian and unconventionals have really been a game changer. You look at the prolific gas
production in the United States today, the market conditions that we were talking about earlier with Roger,
and we didn't see those things at the time.
And so I do think there's a lesson about testing M&A ideas against scenarios that are not the then
prevailing view on forward markets. We did that with the Anadarko transaction last year, and there's
a reason that we like Anadarko. From a synergy standpoint, There's a reason we saw a certain value
level that we would be willing to transact at. And there's a reason we wouldn't go beyond that. And
that's because commodity markets are hard to predict. And we certainly looked at cases that would have
stressed an acquisition because we might experience a different market environment than the one that we
premised maybe our central analysis on.
And so Yogi Berra said that predictions -- I think it's Yogi Berra, predictions are hard, especially when
they're about the future. That's certainly true. It's not lost on us. And I would say that's the big lesson
from these 2 is if you're going into the future with -- or into a deal with a pretty strong commodity price,
make sure you take a look at what happens if you're wrong and whether or not you'd be happy with it in
the scenario where you are wrong.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
On the second question, I think Pierre already addressed someone. I mean return on capital employed.
Last year, you earned 7% at a $64 Brent price, which is lower than the S&P market return, I think. And for
most of the investors, they probably think $60, $65 Brent is as much as they're willing to give companies

in the long-term assumption. So you're talking about an improvement. Can you give us some idea that
where -- given the big portfolio you have, I mean where that you see the biggest opportunity you may
be able to really drive up that return ?I mean we're looking at some of the projects, whether it's Tengiz,
the future growth project or the Anchor, we don't see those projects would be able to improve your overall
return at all.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Paul. Look, there's no silver bullet on improving returns in a flat commodity price environment. You
roll up your sleeves and you get to work on all the little things that cumulatively can drive returns higher.
And that's costs, that's margins, that's value chain optimization, it's reliability, it's technology. There's a
whole host of levers that you have to be working on. This is what we do in the downstream business every
day, and when we've done in the downstream business for decades is you assume margins are going to be
worse in the future than they are today. And you've got to find a way to get more efficient and productive
with your operations in every little thing that you do, and that's what we need to do.
I'm not satisfied with returns at the level that they are. We're not going to wait for prices to be the answer
here. We simply have to -- we have to get after it. And you'll hear more about this in March. We'll talk
more about our plans to improve returns then. But there's not a magic wand here. This is good old-
fashioned hard work, and it's things that we know how to do. We just have to get after it.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And let me just add, in addition to the cost and margin and value chain and all those efforts. The
Permian investments are very accretive to our book returns. We showed in the second quarter that, even
in a growing asset, and we are investing and growing in the Permian, that returns are heading to 20% and
north of that. So we do have investments that are accretive to the portfolio. And as said earlier, we have
some really capital efficiency that has enabled us to sustain and grow the enterprise at lower capital levels
than we have in the past. So when you take the capital efficiency, plus all everything Mike talked about,
we intend to increase our returns over time.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gabelman from Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I guess this follows what Paul just said. Specifically on Anchor, it seemed like CapEx for the project was a
bit high. And I was wondering if you could talk about returns. You've kind of danced around it, but maybe
talk about returns specifically for that project. And is that kind of one of the more competitive projects in
your project queue? And I have a follow-up.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Jason. If I go back to an earlier period of time, our development costs for deepwater projects were
north of $30 a barrel. Anchor is actually south of $20 a barrel, and that includes some investment for new
technology that we have to prove out here because we're dealing with deeper reservoir, higher reservoir
pressure, so 20,000 pounds technology, a little bit of additional export pipeline, which is unique to this
project as well. Operating costs have come down from the high teens per barrel down into the range close
to $10 a barrel. So we've seen significant improvements in drilling and completions performance. And all
of those things come together to bring the cost down.
I'm not going to give you a specific return number because, frankly, we run these things at different prices
and different assumptions around recovery. So we look at a range of potential outcomes. But I will tell
you, it is competitive in our portfolio. It sets us up for additional follow-on development that will, I think,
improve returns. And the technology development unlocks a resource type that we believe holds a lot of

potential as we go forward. And so I don't think we're done in terms of driving these costs down. And in
the deepwater, we're going to continue to look to make these projects even more economic.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
When you say unlock the new resource types, is that kind of a high-pressure, high-temperature, more
further...
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Correct, yes.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
Got it. And then it -- there's not a lot of visibility to your project queue beyond 2025. There's a couple of
Gulf of Mexico projects for Permian and TCO, and that's kind of all you've given us. I wonder if you plan on
providing more visibility to some of your projects that you have options around.
And then kind of attached to that, do you see an opportunity to step in to some international projects,
maybe with companies that are looking to farm down stakes?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we will, in March, lay out a longer view to give you some more transparency. I know that's a
question that a number of people have been asking. The one thing that I would suggest is we went
through a period of time over the last decade where I think we conditioned ourselves and our investors
to believe that the only path to the future was by doing these great, big projects and stacking up lots and
lots of them because that's what we were doing at the time.
We have a very different portfolio today. We have large tranches of production that are pretty flat and
facility limited in Australia LNG, in Kazakhstan. Our unconventionals begin to behave this way as you
build up the scale there. And so at the margin, we have continued to look for the right projects and highly
economic projects, as Pierre said, those that are accretive to returns. But we're not nearly as reliant on
those alone to sustain and grow cash flows into the future. We just have a much more resilient, durable,
long-lived portfolio.
And so grinding away on enormous unconventional positions may not be quite as glamorous as doing
the big projects in terms of giving you a lot of things to talk about, but it really drives strong financial
outcomes. And it's durable, I think, longer than most people believe. And so we'll talk about that more in
March. We'll talk about other opportunities we have in terms of captured opportunities that people may
not be paying much attention to. We'll talk more about our exploration prospects.
And the question on farm-ins, that's always something we evaluate. And if the right opportunities present
themselves, we look at those.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
The first one is actually just on the base decline. If I look at the figures on Slide 8 and take the base
from there, it looks like the base decline was less than 1% in 2019. And I guess that excludes shales. But
I'm just trying to get a sense of whether that figure is relevant and if there's anything funny in the 2019
number that is not applicable going forward. Just some comments around that would be helpful.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mean our base portfolio is large, and there's a lot of different assets in there. There are some things
that now are in the base that are things like Jack/St. Malo and Perdido. And so as -- we've got some
of these deepwater projects that are no longer new projects. Some of the new investments in there to
do next phases of development and the like give you some growth that offsets some of the underlying
decline. But it also comes back to this point I was just making to Jason and a larger percent of our
portfolio now is facility limited, not reservoir limited. And so this mental model that reservoir dynamics
drive our overall production, the shape of our production profile is one, I think, that needs to be calibrated
appropriately to a larger and larger portion that does not behave that way. So that results in more stable,
predictable production.
There's modest investment required to sustain that, be it facility investment or some new wells. But you
look at that, you look at the brownfield opportunities we have and the ways we're using technology to
arrest declines and base decline is just less in our portfolio than it was a decade ago, and that's not a
short-term phenomenon. That's a structural change in how our production looks.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thanks, Biraj. So you've got another one?
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Yes. The second question is just on a slightly different tack, but as you guys are seeing in California,
I wanted to ask about renewable fuels given the favorable regulation there. So what we're seeing is
a number of the U.S. refiners announce expansion projects in renewable diesel, in particular. I was
wondering if that's something you're interested in. What you think about the economics? And then if it's
attractive to you, what's holding you back from investing in that space?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, we've been selling renewable fuels in California for the better part of the last 2 decades, a lot of
blending. We've been looking at manufacturing, but we really have chosen not to go into the ethanol
business.
On renewable diesel, we've got close relationships with suppliers of renewable diesel. And we are -- I
mentioned earlier in a response to a question, we are making modifications at California refining facilities
in order to co-feed biofeedstocks in order to produce renewable diesel. So our view is rather than going
into new projects and greenfield developments, we've got existing infrastructure and kit that we have now
proven the way to safely and reliably introduce biofeedstocks and co-feeds. So it's a more economic way
to do it. It takes advantage of existing capital investment. And so we're working on that. So we are and
will continue to be growing in the biofuels value chain.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Mike, I wonder if I could just hit -- you know we've had some concerns about this particular issue for
a second, and it's part of the Permian. I'd like to just get your perspective on it. I realize what you're
saying about returns and the benefit of royalty interest and mineral interest and so on. But by 2023, this
is going to be 25% of the company. And when I think about the underlying decline rates and the skew
towards NGLs and gas, given the state of the U.S. gas market, help me understand why the increase of

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL | JAN 31, 2020
the -- putting that much of a -- of your portfolio in high-decline assets and skewing towards U.S. gas is
incrementally positive for the overall cash flow capacity of the company.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Doug. So look, it's -- an individual well is a high-decline asset. The Permian Basin, as you get
hundreds and then thousands of wells on production, and you have infrastructure built, the ability to keep
that infrastructure full and have it be a very flat production profile, at modest incremental investment
relative to the production that you're producing is profound. Jay will explain this more in March when we
come to New York. But it is a factory. And running a factory, you got certain costs and certain investments
in the factory and then you push out to the product of the factory, and that's how to think about the
Permian.
The commodity mix, look, it's 75% liquids. We're 50% oil in our portfolio right now, 25% NGLs, 25% gas.
As the volumes continue to grow, we get a lot of oil production, and we take a long view on markets.
Pierre mentioned earlier that returns on investment there are greater than 20% and growing. And so look,
if we've got something -- somebody mentioned earlier, your current returns are at 7%, those need to
improve, well, if you've got opportunities to invest in things that are north of 20%, that's the way to start
to lever up returns.
And so look, we look at the commodity prices on it all. We optimize it. We're moving commodities to
markets near and far to add value to that. But these are high-return, long-lived positions, and it is a
competitive advantage.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I look forward to what Jay's got to say in March. But just to be clear, those returns are full cycle, including
infrastructure and all the plant build out and so on?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
And fully loaded with cost, including corporate costs.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. My follow-up, Mike, is more philosophical, I guess, for the broader energy space. All we all seem to
be hearing, it seems like there's been a kind of an awakening, if you like, that ESG issues just in this last
past 6 months, and particularly this year, more headlines this morning about pension funds just divesting
out of fossil fuels altogether. I'm just curious how -- in your position obviously as an advocate of the
industry, how do you anticipate challenging those kind of questions over fossil fuel is bad, everything else
good kind of thing? How does Chevron compete for the incremental investment dollar? And it's an answer
I'm looking for some help with because obviously it's a challenge for all of us in this business right now.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well, first of all, we believe in ESG. We have been a responsible operator across ES&G for a long,
long, long time, and we invest enormously in that. The E is getting a lot of attention right now. And look,
over the history of our industry, we have -- we and others have reduced the environmental impact of
our operations, time and time and time again. We are doing it again today. And we have the scale, the
technical capability, the financial capability to be a big part of addressing this challenge. And nobody, no
one country, no one industry is going to be the one that solves everything. But collectively, we will respond
to the challenge.
The world needs more energy. The world needs more affordable energy. And people in developing
economies deserve the opportunity to see their lives improve. And affordable, reliable and ever cleaner

energy is essential to improving the quality of life on the planet, which is better today than it has ever
been at any point in history and will be better in the future. And we intend to be a part of that solution.
We acknowledge that the climate is changing. We acknowledge that human activity and fossil fuels
contribute to that. And we acknowledge that we will be part of addressing that as we go forward. And so
we are investing time, people, money, technology in being part of that solution. And look, I'm an optimist.
We're -- there's a lot of pessimism that you can hear out there. And as you say, over maybe the last 6
months, that drumbeat is even louder, but we saw big challenges in the past. And I'm optimistic that we
will be successful again.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citibank.
Alastair R Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
With the impairment, I guess you're signaling something about LNG. So the question is, are you happy to
tack away completely from LNG? I mean you've been one of the biggest global investors in the last decade
and you clearly created a lot of competency within the organization. So are you happy to do nothing in
effect?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
No. We're happy to do things that are competitive and economic, Alastair. And look, we're a big player in
LNG. The world demand for LNG will grow over time, and you have to take a long view on these things.
Commodity markets get into positions where they get overbuilt. Demand grows in a linear fashion. Supply
comes on in stair steps. And so we're in a position right now where the near-term market fundamentals
are a bit tough. But long term, like petrochemicals, like refining, you need to be in low-cost positions that
are highly competitive where you've got scale, technology, operating efficiency. And so those are the kinds
of things we're looking for. And we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to add to our LNG portfolio.
Our assessment on the Kitimat project is, given all the other developments out there in the world that that
one was going to be tough to compete versus our alternatives. And so that was a hard decision to come
to, but it doesn't condemn the asset class for us. As an investment proposition, we just want to find the
very best projects.
Alastair R Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Okay. But my follow-up, I just wanted to get an update on where you're at in TCO. Specifically were there
any discussions you're having with the government? I'm not sure whether the government's been sort of
informed on the cost overruns and where that leaves it.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So the discussions are ongoing. The government is obviously a key stakeholder in this. And so our
people in-country have been engaged. Jay Johnson will be there next week and both visiting the site and
meeting with people from the government. And so when you go through one of these things, there's a
whole series of engagements, and we're in the process on that.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The only thing I'd add to that, Alastair, is that, unlike other agreements in Kazakhstan, our contract's
tax and royalty, right. It's not a production sharing contract. So on production sharing contracts, the
government reimburses the concessionaires for their costs, which is not the case for tax and royalty. So of
course, they're an important stakeholder, but it is a fundamentally different contractual structure.

And our final question comes from the line of Jamaal Dardar from Tudor, Pickering.
Jamaal Dejon Tezino Dardar
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
Just wanted to touch on the outsized dividend growth that we saw versus previous years here. So just
curious on the thought process there. And as you continue to shed assets and large MCPs roll off and
capital intensity is lowered, just wondering how repeatable outsized dividend growth could be over the
long term.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
So if you look back at our dividend history, and we were looking back at it not long ago, whether you're
looking over multiple decades or over the last decade, we've grown it at kind of a compound annual
growth rate of about 6%. And so there's a little bit to the upside of that, but we've been lower than that
here in recent years. And we are well positioned.
Pierre talked about our strong cash flow and the capital efficiency that we have now in our portfolio to
sustain and grow cash flows with a much lower level of capital investment than, I think, people had
become accustomed to over the prior period. We would not have increased the dividend if we weren't
absolutely confident that it's sustainable in perpetuity. And just as we said, we intend to sustain our
buybacks through the cycle, we intend to sustain strong dividend distributions. Our #1 financial priority,
I'll remind you, is to sustain and grow the dividend.
And so this was a signal of confidence in our portfolio. It's a signal of confidence that we can sustain
strong cash generation, even in a commodity price environment like the one we've been in and the one we
continue to be in. And we will talk about this more in March. But we have a very, very strong position to
generate cash out of our portfolio, very efficient capital profile going forward, further efficiencies coming
on the cost side. And we're very confident in the capacity that we have.
Decisions are made by the Board. I can't get ahead of the Board on what they may do in the future. But
I'll tell you, the Board shares the confidence we have in our cash-generating capacity.
Jamaal Dejon Tezino Dardar
Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division
And then just a quick one on the buybacks. You mentioned the sustainable nature. It's difficult for us to
model the impact of the PSC roll-off, but it seems like, very temporarily, there could be, at strip pricing,
time periods where, in order to satisfy the full buyback, maybe you lean into the balance sheet there. Just
wanted to verify the comfort there, obviously, given where you sit as best-of-class on your debt ratio.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Jamaal. No -- yes, we -- if we have to lean on the balance sheet for some point in time,
that's okay, right? We've said we want to sustain it through the cycle. We've never said the buyback has to
be funded every single quarter from free cash flow. So that's not our expectation.
We have the strongest balance sheet in the industry. Our net debt ratio is 13%. Gross debt is 16%.
We have the capability to take on some debt. I've talked about, we don't have a target debt range, but
certainly, I'd be comfortable higher than we are right now. But if we're outside of -- if we're a little bit low,
that's okay. That's how the math works. So if we generate cash at surplus to our top 3 priorities, which is
to pay the dividend, invest in the business and have a strong balance sheet, and -- we'll return that in the
form of share buybacks.
But we also want to keep that ratable and sustainable. So we just don't want to ramp up buybacks
because we want to be able to essentially dollar cost average and do it through the cycle.

So the short answer is yes, there'll be times we'll lean on our balance sheet, our balance sheet has that
capability. And our intent is to sustain the buyback through the cycle.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is
being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's Third Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast.
On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the
slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other
forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Turning to Slide 3 and Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Wayne. We had another quarter of strong operational and financial performance.
First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.36 per share. The quarter's
results included a $430 million special item tax accrual associated with a cash repatriation in the fourth
quarter. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $74 million. Excluding special items and FX gains,
earnings were $2.9 billion or $1.55 per share. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the
appendix to this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion. We also maintained a strong balance sheet with a low
debt ratio. Importantly, our strong cash flow allowed us to continue to deliver significant cash to our
shareholders. During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.25 billion of
shares, in line with our annual share repurchase run rate guidance of $5 billion. Year-to-date, we've
returned approximately $9.5 billion in dividends and share repurchases.
Year-to-date organic CapEx was $14.5 billion, slightly below our ratable budget of $15 billion. Total CapEx,
which includes inorganic transactions that are unbudgeted, totaled $15 billion. We are maintaining a firm
commitment to capital discipline to improve returns on capital.
Turning to Slide 4. Third quarter cash flow was strong, down from the prior quarter due to lower Brent
prices and the absence of the termination fee received from Anadarko. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow
from operations of nearly $22 billion funded all 4 of our financial priorities. With nearly $12 billion in free
cash flow, we currently have an annualized yield of about 7%, highlighting our ability to generate strong
free cash flow in a lower oil price environment. Through the 3 quarters, the company's cash flow dividend
breakeven price, excluding working capital, is in the low $50s Brent.
Asset sales proceeds add to our positive cash flow and further lower the breakeven while high-grading our
portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $3 billion. And by year-end, after
the expected closing of the sale of our U.K. North Sea assets, we will be near the low end of our $5 billion
to $10 billion guidance range with 1 year to go.
Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter 2019 earnings of $2.6 billion decreased about $1.5 billion versus prior
year. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings declined primarily due to lower crude and natural

gas prices, partially offset by higher liftings. Downstream earnings also were down primarily due to higher
turnaround and maintenance costs, lower volumes driven by the Southern Africa divestment and lower
chemicals margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges versus
last year.
Turning to Slide 6. Compared to the second quarter, third quarter earnings decreased by about $1.7
billion. Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were lower, primarily due to a 10% decrease
in Brent prices since the second quarter. Downstream earnings, excluding FX, improved due to stronger
refining and marketing margins, partly offset by lower chemical margins and the impacts of planned
turnarounds. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower corporate charges and tax items.
I'll now pass it to Jay.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre.
On Slide 7, third quarter oil-equivalent production increased 3% compared to a year ago with higher shale
and tight production in the Permian as well as higher production from major capital projects following the
ramp-ups at Big Foot and Hebron. This growth was partly offset by unplanned downtime at Hibernia, asset
sales and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 8. Third quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the fourth
consecutive quarter despite the impact of planned turnarounds and asset sales. Year-to-date production,
excluding asset sales, is about 5% higher than 2018, which is consistent with our earlier guidance of 4%
to 7%, as shown by the middle bar. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we expect production growth to
be primarily driven by our shale and tight assets as well as the continued ramp-up of Hebron.
Turning to Slide 9, I'll provide an update on the TCO project. In the third quarter, we completed a detailed
cost and schedule review of the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Kazakhstan.
As a result, the cost estimate for the project has been updated to $45.2 billion with an additional $1.3
billion in contingency. The expected start-up of FGP has shifted to mid-2023 and will now follow WPMP,
which remains on schedule for start-up in late 2022. The updated estimate has been submitted by TCO for
shareholder approval.
Overall, the increase in total cost, including contingency, is about 25%. The waterfall shows the key
drivers of the updated estimate. As discussed previously, higher engineering costs and engineering
impact on fabrication consumed about 2/3 of the original contingency. Additional construction costs
represent the largest category of the revised estimate. More than half of the increase in construction
cost is due to higher quantities than originally estimated, including significant increases for electrical and
instrumentation, which was one of the last scopes of the engineering work to be completed. The balance is
primarily driven by higher unit construction rates due to higher market rates and more complex work than
originally anticipated.
Finally, the schedule and other category is primarily driven by the FGP schedule delay and increased costs
for operational readiness and the owners team. Despite the increased project cost, TCO remains a world-
class asset that's expected to generate strong cash flow for many years.
Turning to Slide 10. Beginning in 2020, we expect spending to ramp down as we complete the project. The
project is approximately 70% complete. Detailed engineering and procurement are essentially complete,
mitigating the risk of further impact on fabrication or construction. Work at 3 of the 4 fabrication yards is
complete. The logistics system is working well and the 2019 sealift has successfully concluded. Modules
are being delivered, restacked and set on foundations as planned. Drilling is ahead of schedule with 40 of
the 55 wells drilled and completed.
The lower chart on the slide shows the completed and remaining capital spend. Most of the remaining
scope now resides with construction and start-up activities. Given the work completed, including 2 full
years of on-site construction experience, we believe we're on track to deliver the project in line with the

updated estimate. Importantly, we're not changing Chevron's capital guidance. Our 2020 capital, to be
announced in December, will be in the range of $18 billion to $20 billion. And we're reaffirming our capital
guidance of $19 billion to $22 billion for 2021 through 2023. We remain committed to capital discipline
and delivering leading returns for our shareholders.
Slide 11 highlights some recent commercial developments in our upstream business. First, we recently
announced a farm-in agreement to take a 40% working interest in 3 Mexican blocks in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico.
We also recently participated in Brazil's 16th bid round and were awarded a 35% to 40% working interest
in 2 operated and 3 non-operated blocks. We're excited about these additions to our exploration portfolio.
Last week, we signed an agreement to sell the company which holds our interest in the Malampaya gas
field in the Philippines. We're expecting the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.
Now I'll turn it back to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jay.
And turning to Slide 12. This quarter, there were a number of highlights related to lowering the carbon
intensity of our operations. Earlier this month, we announced 2 new greenhouse gas reduction goals. The
new goals are aimed at reducing our oil emission intensity by 5% to 10% and our gas emission intensity
by 2% to 5% between the years of 2016 and 2023. These are in addition to the targets we set at the
beginning of the year to reduce our flaring intensity and methane emissions over the same time period.
In Australia, we started up the Gorgon CO2 injection project in early August and are in the process
of ramping it up to full capacity. Once fully operational, this will be one of the world's largest carbon
sequestration projects and is expected to reduce Gorgon's greenhouse gas emissions by about 40% over
the life of the project.
Lastly, construction is underway on a new 29-megawatt solar farm which will supply electricity to
Chevron's Lost Hills field in California.
Now looking ahead. In upstream, we expect full year 2019 production growth to be in the middle of the
4% to 7% range, excluding 2019 asset sales. Asset sales, primarily in Denmark and Brazil, are forecasted
to have a full year impact near 30,000 barrels per day. Planned turnarounds, primarily in Gorgon and
Nigeria, will be lower than the third quarter but are expected to impact production in the fourth quarter by
more than 70,000 barrels per day. As Jay mentioned earlier, we have acquired new exploration acreage in
Brazil that is expected to add about $120 million in inorganic capital which is unbudgeted. Full year TCO
co-lending is expected to be below the full year guidance of $2 billion, dependent primarily on the fourth
quarter distribution decision.
In downstream, we expect high refinery turnaround activity. This includes a refinery-wide turnaround at
SPRC in Thailand which occurs once every 5 years. In the fourth quarter, we expect to make the $430
million tax payment related to the cash repatriation and to repurchase shares of $1.25 billion.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Wayne.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I guess the first question related to the updated Tengiz budget. Given that a lot of the spending is already
behind you, do you anticipate that this is going to have any significant effects on the co-lending that you'll
be making to the venture in the coming years? And then maybe I'll just ask my second question now. The
U.S. downstream earnings were pretty robust this quarter relative to what I would have expected just
given a heavy turnaround schedule. Is it just the margin environment that was helping you out or is there
anything else that's happening in downstream that is maybe more ratable?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
All right. Thanks, Jason. This is Pierre. So on co-lending, we'll provide guidance for 2020 next quarter as
we have in prior years. As you know, co-lending depends on 3 primary factors: the level of the capital
spend, oil prices, the macro environment and any dividends. And I guided in the fourth quarter that we
expect the full year for 2019 to be lower than our $2 billion, but it will vary depending on the fourth
quarter dividend decision that TCO makes. So if the dividend is higher, the co-lending would be higher. If
it's lower, the co-lending would be lower.
So if you go back to how this cost increase impacts co-lending, you really have to look at it as overall
cash flow. So clearly, if you hold prices and dividends constant, higher capital costs will result in higher
co-lending, but that does not translate to lower Chevron cash because we're going to offset the increases
in TCO elsewhere in our capital program. And so if you remember, TCO capital spend is noncash and co-
lending turns part of it into cash because we think it's the most economic way to finance our share of the
TCO spending. But again, we're going to have offsets elsewhere in our capital program, which will be cash
CapEx, and that will help offset that higher co-lending.
If we go to downstream in the quarter, there's nothing that isn't inherent in the underlying margins that I
can really point out to. Distillate margins have popped up a little bit, and we tend to have more production
in that space. You're seeing some of the effects of IMO are rolling through the system. I mean, West Coast
margins had some strength at times in the quarter, but I would attribute the third quarter performance
largely to how we operated in the underlying margin environment.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question, just coming back to the idea that the Tengiz CapEx increase will not affect the overall
capital spending plan. Are we just talking here about the fact that perhaps you're at low end of CapEx
ranges and now you move to high end of CapEx ranges or how do you calibrate being able to offset $4
billion to $5 billion of incremental spending net to Chevron within the budget? Is it activity elsewhere or is
it just within ranges here we're talking about?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Phil, there's a couple of different places that we look to. First, TCO itself in its base capital spend has
offset and will continue to offset some of the increase in the FGP spend. Beyond that, though, as
Pierre was talking about, we have a much more flexible capital program now with a lot of short-cycle

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
activity. And we're able to pace and adjust that program to fit within the investment level that we've set.
And particularly as it relates to gas-related investments, there are opportunities for us in this current
environment to scale back some of that as appropriate. And those are things we may have done anyway.
And then the final thing is just the capital efficiency that we're driving throughout the business. Our base
business performance has been very strong. We have digital initiatives trying to reduce our -- that make
our capital spend more effective. And so right across the board, people are figuring out ways to do more
with less.
I'll give you a good example, was in Bangladesh recently, where instead of making a major capital project
to add some additional compression, the team was able to look at recompleting some wells, adding some
perforations and doing some debottlenecking on existing facilities, which extended the production plateau
and alleviated the need for incremental capital spend on another project.
So it's these types of spending that we constantly are working through as we allocate our capital each
year. We're going to remain capital disciplined. We're going to stay within the ranges that we've given you.
And we're going to look to do it while we stay focused on delivering the value and returns that are really
what's driving our decisions.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And if I can just build off of Jay's answer there and just be very specific. No, we do not intend to go from
the low end to the high end of the range. We intend to find offsets through the way that Jay has talked
about. We have a range because we're giving guidance out to 2023. It is a cyclical business. Oil prices can
change. COGS can change. We have short-cycle capital that we can flex up or down, as Jay mentioned.
So the intent of the range, we still want to keep the range for what it's there for and our intent is to offset
those increase elsewhere.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. All right. And then I guess just the follow-up would be for Jay. I'm just trying to kind of rewind here
back to a year or so ago, there were some fears that things were getting a bit behind in Tengiz. And then
back at the Analyst Day, the tone sounded much better that things were back on track. And now we have
a 25% increase, which is fairly sizable. So I'm just hoping you could provide a little bit more color about
how these things have progressed to the point that we have this kind of increase.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. I think what's changed fundamentally is we completed a very detailed cost and schedule review in the
third quarter. So that's just been completed. And as we looked at it, there were a couple of key elements.
We've talked in the past about the overall engineering program, the cost of that program and the impact
the engineering has had on fabrication and construction. And you can see those in the first 2 bars of Slide
9. And that really reflects that accelerated consumption of contingency that we've talked about in the past.
What was, frankly, a surprise was the increasing quantities that we're seeing coming out of the late stages
of engineering, particularly related to things like the electrical and instrumentation, controls, fire and gas,
some of the late changes in how we're going to do the backfill and quantities associated with it. Those
drove a much higher construction cost than we had anticipated. And if you look at the third bar, you see
that represented.
The other big surprise was having to delay the start-up of FGP by a year. This was really driven
fundamentally by an assumption change. We had planned to integrate modules. Our estimate was based
on the integration of the modules in FGP, each one taking about 12 months from the time it was placed
on its foundation until it's fully integrated. While we're seeing very complete modules come from the
fabrication yard just as we've gotten a year of ME&I experience this year, our view has changed that
we're using 14 months as our planning basis, and that's pushed that schedule time out. So the growth in

quantities and the longer schedule have really been the surprises that we didn't anticipate previously. So
that's really where we are at this point in time.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
So the first question just on the Permian and the glide path here. You continue to trend above your target
levels. Can you just talk, Jay, with some detail about how the plan is progressing in the Permian and any
comments that you would have on sort of this upcoming U.S. election and any impact to the way you think
about prosecuting your acreage?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, I'll start with just the performance in the Permian. Our view, as you know, has been to be very
disciplined and focused on returns and efficiency. And we have seen continued performance improvement
in our drilling, in particular. Our completions have remained very strong throughout. And so we're
watching every segment of the value chain, from the actual land acquisition to fill in some of the
checkerboards and allow the longer laterals, right through the drilling efficiency, into the completions,
the facilities and on production. And then working with our marketing and transportation group to ensure
that we're getting the highest realizations we can for the products that we're producing. So we're on plan.
We've actually, as we said, doing very well with our production profile. We're pleased with the performance
that we're seeing, but we're always driving for better performance.
In terms of the upcoming election, look, hydraulic fracturing has been done for millions of wells, not only
in the U.S. but around the world. It's done safely. It's done effectively. We learn more about it all the time.
And it's really unlocked a huge economic benefit for the country as well as for the companies involved.
It's also unlocked some environmental benefits in terms of the proliferation of gas, which isn't always to
our benefit from a profit standpoint, but it's a great fuel for the U.S. If you look at it from our company's
standpoint, we have less than about 10% of our Permian unconventional acreage that is on federal land,
and all of that is in New Mexico. So from a relative standpoint, while we would not like to see any kind of
restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, that's the context for our company.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Now that's great. Appreciate it. And then the follow-up here is related to Brazil. There's the upcoming
transfer of rights auction and you called out some of your increased exploration acreage there. Can you
provide some context in terms of the way that Chevron thinks about Brazil and how aggressive it sees
itself being there over the next couple of years?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, we've talked before that we are very happy actually with our existing resource base. We've been
doing a lot of portfolio work, as you know, over the last several years to really clean up our portfolio. And
part of that has been a reload of our exploration strategy. But because we're happy with our resource
base, we have primarily focused on reloading in the exploration space because we're looking for resource
additions out in the future. And we also want to manage our capital over the period of time.
So our focus has been on exploration opportunities. That's what you've seen us do in Brazil. And our focus
has been that way. We are interested in Brazil because we see the pre-salt as a prolific hydrocarbon basin.
It's a good place to be to increase the probability of success on exploration. And we'll stay focused on that.
We have a couple of wells coming up next year which will be good wells for us. We're looking forward to
seeing those results, but we'll continue to stay focused primarily on exploration as we look forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Scotiabank.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Jay, don't want to beat the dead horse on Tengiz, but what have you learned from Tengiz to further fine-
tune your development and project execution process? Clearly that something was not working in order
for us to have that at this stage, to have the delay for a year and also that for 25% increase. So what
have we learned?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, Paul, it's a good question. We ask ourself all the time, how can we do better. Clearly, this is a
disappointment. I'm very disappointed because we have taken all the lessons learned from the past and
tried to make sure we're building those into each project as we go forward.
When we think about what's gone well. There have been a lot of dimensions to this, particularly the
execution work is going very well. I'm happy with the way the fabrication work has gone in the yards.
The modules are coming out very complete and dimensionally accurate. When we set them on their
foundations, everything is lining up. The logistics system has been flawless. The performance is exactly
how we had planned. And it's delivering modules to the site very effectively. And we've been able to
complete the sealift for 2019. So we're happy on all those fronts.
The schedule delay is a disappointment. And that has to do a lot with the quantity growth we saw in
engineering. And as we've said, we've been unhappy with the overall engineering performance on this
project. Not only the engineering cost themselves, but the impact it's had on fabrication and construction.
We need to do better in this area. And it's an area that we're going to continue to learn our lessons from
this and build it forward. We don't have any other very large mega-projects like this that are land-based
anywhere in the world at the current time so we've got time to take these lessons learned and really think
about how we approach this differently in the future. Our commitment remains on capital discipline. Our
commitment remains to execute this project to the best of our ability.
When you look at the improvements taking place on the ground in Tengiz. In 2018, we talked about
productivity that we needed to improve. And we saw a 40% to 50% improvement in the productivity
across the site. In 2019, this year, we've seen another 30% to 40% improvement in productivity. So
we're seeing great improvements with the production, the construction management system, production
management system. And we're going to continue to stay focused on productivity, on completing work and
moving it to mechanical completion and then getting it through systems completion and then to start-up.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And if I could just build off of Jay's answer, Paul. Just to put this in an enterprise perspective, the
additional depreciation after tax to Chevron is less than $0.20 per share or less than the cash flow impact
of $1 change in oil prices. So as Jay said, we own this and we need to do better. And trust me, we're
fighting for every dollar. But I did want to put in perspective what this means for a company like Chevron.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
Sure. Understand. But I think, Jay, when you're saying that you're unhappy about the engineering on this.
So you said, not to point a finger, but is it an internal issue or just an external -- the contractor that you
guys use?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
You're asking me...
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
How you're really going to be able to mitigate it in the future? I mean, you say you learned from that, but
exactly what have we learned and what is the change will be?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
From an engineering standpoint, Paul, I think we have a couple of things. One is, we are doing more
to bring the early engineering back in-house and do more focused design development with our own
capabilities. And we're trying to minimize the amount of variation that we see in terms of each project
team's decisions that they make around engineering. I think that's a key part of it. And I think looking at
the total project in the context of the environment it's going to be built is also important. I do think there
are also opportunities for the industry to improve on engineering. I don't think this is necessarily isolated
to our company. So there's work to be done as we really understand how to better define and prosecute
the engineering programs that are necessary for these projects.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
What Jay said is, we don't have projects like this in our queue. If you look at our capital program, a lot
of base business capital, shale and tight capital. We are going to have some major capital projects, but
the ones that are coming up are deepwater projects and they're very different than these. A lot of the
spending is in drilling and completion where we're very good. On the facility side, it tends to be standard
designs in fabrication yards. As Jay said, it's not land-based projects in remote locations. And we have
a better track record in those projects. So again, we need to do better. We're learning from it. From a
enterprise perspective, the portfolio, the investments that are at least in front of us are hitting a different
place than where this project has been.
Paul Cheng
Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division
My final question, Jay and Pierre, I think in Tengiz, even before the cost increase, the full project return on
capital -- the full cycle internal rate of return is actually pretty low. And with this then, of course, it's much
lower. But the cash flow will be great once that they come onstream. So which is a more important factor
when you guys determine whether you want to go with a certain project? Is it the internal rate of return
or is the cash flow and the sustainability of that cash flow, say, for how long? So I'm trying to understand
that decision-making process.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Look, I'll start and maybe Jay will add some comments. I mean, you've heard Jay and Mike and
myself are all talking about increasing returns on capital. So we are focused on the return on investment.
And so we are looking at it. Once you have a cost increase, I think it's stating the obvious that, that
dilutes the returns. And we're taking a lot of actions to offset that, both in Tengiz and across the rest of
the portfolio. I tried to give, again, some financials that kind of characterize what the impact is, again, on
a company like Chevron, less than $0.20 per share. But we are looking fundamentally at returns on capital
but we also know cash is important. It helps pay the dividend and support the share buybacks.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
I would just say this particular project, Paul, I know your views on it have been the same for a long time,
but this is an important project for Tengiz. It does lower the back pressure on all the wells and addresses
the declining reservoir pressure that we see there. It provides excess gas handling, which will unlock
oil production in our existing facilities as well as for FGP. And it helps maintain reservoir pressure in the

platform, which is an important aspect of the overall performance of Tengiz, not just the incremental
performance. There also, as Pierre said, we're looking at ways that this can be offset. And one of the key
milestones that was achieved was the decision to debottleneck the CPC pipeline. And so that's going to
open up some additional export capacity which will improve realizations and help boost returns and help
mitigate and offset some of the increases that we're seeing on project cost.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
I wanted to follow up on some of the exploration discussion from earlier. You talked a little bit about Brazil,
but you also highlighted in the release and the slides some additional blocks in the offshore Gulf of Mexico.
And I think you've been fairly active in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico leasing as well. As we kind of step back
and look at where you're seeing the most opportunity from here, can you talk a little bit more about that
and the overall strategy here and the desire, if any, to diversify growth options away from shale and tight,
but I think you mentioned there were some larger capital projects offshore, potentially in the pipe. A little
more color on that would be great.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. Thanks for the question. So in addition to deepwater Brazil, we have been very interested in some
of the deepwater in the Mexican areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And this plays on a lot of the knowledge we
already have in the U.S. sector of the Gulf of Mexico. So we've recently farmed into some additional blocks
and these complement nicely some blocks we had acquired in an earlier bid round.
One of our strategies has been to move out of more of the frontier, highly speculative areas and really
focus our exploration initiatives in the areas that we consider to be highly prolific basins, and that really
increases our probability of success. At the same time we're doing that, we're trying to balance the
amount of capital that goes in early and really use the fact that some of this is only under 2D seismic or
lightly explored to open up new opportunities for development.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we've been very active. And one of the key strategies in the U.S. Gulf is to
focus a lot of our new blocks around existing infrastructure. And we're looking to push that envelope of
how far we can tie back exploration opportunities or discoveries to existing infrastructure and avoid having
to build brand-new greenfield. A couple of examples of that would be, for example, you recently heard
about the Esox discovery with another operator. That will tie back to Tubular Bells. It's very close. It brings
new production in at very low capital cost and with a very short cycle time. So those are kind of the low-
cost, high-return subsea tiebacks that are being enabled and supported by our exploration strategy in the
U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
We're also talking about extending that reach, as I said, through some of the new technology. We have
used quite successfully the single-phase seafloor pumping at Jack and St. Malo and really proven that
technology. And we've now finished the technical certification to move to multi-phase pumping. And this
can really extend that radius of which we can pull production back to existing host that have haulage. So
it's entirely in line with our theme of exploring in prolific basins but also utilizing existing infrastructure and
getting more out of our existing facilities whenever possible.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Got it. Great. And my second is on some of the comments around incremental efficiencies you're realizing
across the portfolio is one of the things you mentioned in response to the Tengiz cost pressure. And Pierre,
I think you mentioned also is an area where you've seen success across the portfolio in your prepared
remarks. So I was hoping to get a bit more specifics on where within the portfolio you're seeing those
capital efficiency improvements. And then also, to the extent you are cutting back capital in more gassy

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
areas in response to the Tengiz pressure, any additional detail on where that is in North America, gas
elsewhere in the portfolio, additional color would be helpful there as well.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Sure. The increased efficiencies, quite honestly, are happening across the board. All of our units are really
focused on how to continue to drive better performance out of the investments we've made in the past.
We've seen some great improvements, in particular, for example, in Angola, where they have developed
some new opportunities by using our existing installed base. We saw very strong cash flow coming out of
Angola. And there's been a lot of good cooperative work with the government of Angola to unlock many of
the marginal reserves that can be tied back to our existing facilities, but it really is happening around the
world.
In terms of the Gulf of Mexico, we've seen our unit development cost come down to where we're now
targeting $16 to $20 a barrel for new facilities. And projects like Anchor and Whale, certainly, we're
targeting in that range. The OpEx in the Gulf of Mexico in the deepwater has come down to just under $10
a barrel, which is a significant reduction from where we were in 2014.
We're taking these lessons learned. We're sharing them across other areas in the company to make
sure that -- it's one thing to share, it's another to adopt these best practices, but we're seeing great
cooperation between our business units. And we're going to be really focused on doing that even more as
we move forward. All of this isn't just in response to Tengiz. But rather, it's the context of Tengiz in this
environment that's allowing us to do this, and I think do it quite efficiently.
In terms of the specifics on where in our capital program we'll be making changes, that's not something
that we'll discuss at this point in time, but we'll give more color on that potentially in December with our
capital announcement and of course, in the SAM, the Security Analyst Meeting that we do early in the year
each year.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, Research Division
Sorry, I have another one on Tengiz. Jay, you mentioned the significant productivity improvements in
2018, 2019. But taking that on board, that would suggest the CapEx increase was coming quite a long
time ago. So I guess just want to square that comment with the CapEx increase today and the timing of
that. But taking a step back, you look at the last few years and you've had your fair share of issues at
some of these major projects. Pierre, you're signing off on these. I just wonder if these experiences make
you think twice about embarking on these types of projects of this scale in the future? That would be my
first question. And I've got another follow-up.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
So on the productivity, the contracts at site at Tengiz and the construction are largely unit rate. So we pay
based on the quantities that are being installed. But the productivity is important because it relates to the
underlying schedule and the ability to finish the work and execute the work in the time frame that we've
got and with the numbers of people we plan because there's a lot of indirects that come with having to
add additional direct labor. So while the unit rates have been in place, it's really the complexity that has
increased on some of the manhours. We've talked in the past about the unit rate cost that were in our bids
for the mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work. But really, the surprise has been the increase in
quantities because when you multiply the quantities times those rates, that's what's resulting in the higher
cost, and as I said, the shift in schedule. So that's how I square that with what we've given you in the past
and really what came out of the detailed cost and schedule review that we just completed.

Yes. And Biraj, in terms of -- I think I addressed this. I mean, we don't have other projects like FGP/WPMP
in our queue. Kitimat is being worked but it's not ready. What we have is a lot of base business capital,
a lot of shale and tight and hopefully, some deepwater projects here over time. So I understand your
question. It's theoretical. I'm not going to speculate about it. But as I look at our portfolio right now, we
don't have that choice. That said, we're going to be in the business a long time. We're going to learn from
it. We have to do better, but we don't have any immediate capital decisions that are in this kind of a large-
scale, land-based construction project.

Okay. Understood. Just to follow up, hopefully, an easier question. But the tax on repatriated cash, are you
expecting that to be a one-off or should we expect more of these in the future? Can you confirm whether
that was cash tax or just a P&L charge?

quarter and decided to repatriate this cash which was previously unremitted. So prior to completing this
review, these earnings were expected to be invested outside the U.S., and that's why we didn't accrue
for the state and foreign withholding taxes. So when we made the decision to repatriate it, that's when
we accrue the tax. It is a cash tax but the tax payment will be in the fourth quarter. We accrue the P&L
was in the third quarter. And the actual cash movements, so this will bring non-U.S. cash into the U.S. It
will allow us to lower our cash balances, will lower our debt balances. We're doing it because it's the right
economic decision.
And this is for prior earnings. We do not expect other types of repatriations of prior earnings like this. At
the same time, there could be some current earnings that, of course, are repatriated, and that's in the
normal course of business. So no, this is a one-off. It's over $8 billion of non-U.S. cash being brought to
the U.S. You won't see our U.S. cash balances go down by that full amount because some of it had been
lent into the U.S., but we expect our year-end cash balances to be $3 billion to $4 billion lower than where
we ended the third quarter. We ended the third quarter a little bit high because we were preparing for
some of these moves to repatriate the cash.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Jay, I know you don't -- or maybe, Pierre, I know you guys don't normally want to talk about fiscal terms.
But in light of the Tengiz cost increases, I just wondered if you could just remind us or walk us through
what the implications are for cost recovery because I'm guessing that with existing production and lack of
ring-fencing and so on, the net impact of this may not be as severe as obviously the headline cost overrun
suggest. I just wonder if you could walk us through what the cost recovery ramifications are, please? And
I've got a follow-up.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, this is a tax and royalty contract in Tengiz. And so it's really going to be through the DD&A and the
way that flows through the books in terms of the recovery. So it's impacting returns more than it will the
actual cash flow once we get past the start-up of the facility.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
I was under the impression it was an accelerated DD&A. Is that not the case?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
As I said, we're not going to discuss the terms of the contract, but it's a tax and royalty contract and...
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
And just to be clear, when I refer to the less than $0.20, I'm talking about book DD&A, book depreciation,
not tax depreciation, which obviously is different.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. No. I'm sorry, I thought there was an accelerated piece to that. My follow-up is really more
going back to the Permian. Obviously, the plan you've laid out is continuing to -- you're continuing to
outperform against, at least in production profile. But when you laid out the plan, you talked about when
you would expect the Permian to be cash breakeven in terms of capital and cash flow and obviously
royalty contribution and so on. Obviously, NGL and gas prices have deteriorated quite materially. So I'm
wondering if you can just update your thoughts on that. And specifically, on the takeaway solutions that
you have announced over the last several months, what does that do to your ability to improve gas and
NGL realizations? Are those leased line or are they going to uplift your realizations with more work in the
Gulf Coast type metric? And I'll leave it there.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, we went through a lot of this, Doug, as you know, in the second quarter call, and that guidance
still stands. In terms of the crude takeaway capacity, we have sufficient capacity, not just to produce it
into the basin, but to take it to Houston. And now we have export capacity opening up as well, 35% now
and 40% in 2020. So that's the crude side of things. NGLs are sufficient through 2020. And in terms of
gas, our primary focus was to make sure we have evacuation capacity in the basin. And we have 100%
of that covered. Our view and our practice is that we have no routine flaring of gas to enable production.
And we've been able to honor that. In terms of moving gas out of the basin, right now, we have about
25% capacity. And it's going to vary based on how these different pipelines come on stream. But by the
second quarter of 2021, we're expecting to have about 80% of our gas flowing out of the basin. We are
still expecting to have free cash flow positive next year.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Jay, just to be clear, is it 60%, 65% gas and NGLs? I know you talk about liquids, but can you split the oil
versus NGL portion? Then I'll leave it at that.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We see roughly half of our total mix is in crude, about 1/4 of it's in gas liquids and about 1/4 of it's in
natural gas.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Dan Boyd from BMO Capital Markets.
Daniel Jon Boyd
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research
I want to actually follow up again on the TCO spend. And if I recall correctly, last year, you spent about
$600 million more than you initially budgeted. So what I'm wondering is, how much of the sort of overrun
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
is going to be already spent or in the budget by the end of this year? That's sort of the first question.
And then the follow-up is, when I look at your total CapEx budget, in order to be below the $20 billion
for next year given that affiliate spending will still stay high, are you implying that your cash CapEx could
potentially be down next year? And I'm just wondering if there's a potential production impact of that or if
the Permian is running ahead of schedule, enough to offset any of that.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
So a couple of things, Dan. First of all, I'd take you to Slide 10. And that kind of shows our production or
our spending profile for the FGP project. And we see '18 and '19 as our peak years of spend. And as we
look to 2020, we'll start spending at a lower rate as we move and consolidate really the activities largely
into site construction work. We have one more year of fabrication to go in 1 of the 4 original yards. And
that work is currently about 73% complete.
In terms of how to allocate the incremental spend over the total project, I would say, roughly, it's about
half of it behind us, half of it or about $4 billion to $5 billion in front of us. But as we look at it, it's really
in that increased construction cost where we see the majority of the increase and the surprise. The part
that we did in the first, the engineering and fabrication was more directed around the consumption of
contingency. The increases we've really seen have been in construction and schedule.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
So Dan, again, just to build off Jay's comments. I mean, we're coming off, have reaffirmed the guidance
for next year between $18 billion and $20 billion. TCO will be coming off, as Jay said. And so we're
finalizing our plan and our capital program right now. But we have, between the efficiencies that Jay
talked about and choices we can make around deferring low-return projects, we absolutely have the
capability of landing a capital program in that range.
Daniel Jon Boyd
BMO Capital Markets Equity Research
Okay. And the production outlook more than offset that in other areas?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. I mean, we haven't given production guidance year by year. We've given the 3% to 4% production
outlook to 2023, so no change to that. Again, some of the examples, some of the offsets do not impact
production. Clearly, if we defer some lower return natural gas investments or we decide to flex down some
of our shorter cycle spend, that could have a modest impact on production, but there are other things that
are going better, like the Permian and other offsets that we're trying to manage. So we will give our usual
1-year outlook on production guidance on the fourth quarter call in late January.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I guess maybe it's been mentioned a couple of different times, the weakness in gas. Maybe as you think
about global gas markets, LNG, what you're seeing in terms of any additional risk we should think about
on the spot market side or on the contracted side for LNG. And then as a little add-on to that, just kind of
an update of how Gorgon and Wheatstone are performing here and planned and unplanned maintenance?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
Okay. Gorgon and Wheatstone are actually performing quite well. Gorgon Train 1 is currently under a
scheduled turnaround, a planned turnaround. But as you saw, our third quarter production -- and there's a
slide in the back -- was very strong out of both Gorgon and Wheatstone. And we continue to stay focused
on enhancing the reliability and the utilization of those facilities as well as creeping the capacity. We have
a turnaround schedule that is going to be planned for both of those and will be an annual event. We'll
talk about those as we get closer to them. We have another train for Gorgon next year that has been
announced. And these will be done to allow us to get into a regular rotation of turnaround so they can be
done safely and efficiently just as we do in our downstream facilities and places like Tengiz.
We do see the potential for spot to be higher as we increase production. As we hit stronger production, we
will have more cargoes available for spot. That's a good thing because we actually have more production
than we'd planned for. But over time, as the reliability continues to strengthen, we would expect to try and
term up some of that anticipated spot cargoes and reduce the amount of spot in any given quarter relative
to either long-term or medium-term contracts that we've put in place.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The only thing to add, and Jay mentioned this in the second quarter, we have seen some customers
downward flex on the long-term contracts. This is something that is within contractual limits and within
the contractual terms. They have to do it almost a year ahead. It's tied to the annual delivery schedule.
But we have seen some of that, and that has resulted in a little bit more in the spot market than we
otherwise would have.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And any particular weakness in the spot markets that you're seeing at this point or are we pretty well past
that for the summertime?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
In terms of calling, look, the macro on spot LNG looks sort of structurally oversupplied. Of course, a cold
winter can certainly fix a fair amount of that, but storage levels in Europe are full. Asia seems to be well
positioned. So if I look at it right now, again, it looks oversupplied and there's more LNG coming on. But
markets surprise us all the time. I mean, the takeaway for us is, we are just not really exposed to the spot
market. We are primarily selling under oil-linked, long-term contracts.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
So my first question is on the Permian, and it's probably for Jay. I think it's well understood that your
leading-edge wells perform better and better. I'm interested as the base gets bigger and is more important
to the overall production targets how your first-generation wells look, if your EURs that you projected
look like they're intact or growing or changing in any way? And if there's sort of rigless activity workover
stuff that you have to do that you hadn't modeled or maybe it's less than what you modeled, but just any
update on kind of your older wells and how that component of the Permian is shaping up today would be
great.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
That's a good question, Sam. Thank you. When we look at our production performance out of our wells,
the early horizontal wells have actually performed as we expected them to perform. And so our EURs
have been consistent with expectation for the wells as we move through. As we have continued to evolve

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 17
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
though our basis of design and our completion strategies, we've seen higher and higher EURs. And the
new wells, of course, are meeting those expectations as well. So overall, the program is working as
planned. The newer wells, as you point out, are much more productive than some of the older wells, but
they're all meeting the expectations that we've set for them at the time in the aggregate. Obviously, any
individual well may be higher or lower than planned. But as a portfolio, as a program, we've been overall
pleased with the performance. And that's really what's underpinning our ability to deliver the production
profile you can see on the chart in the appendix.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. And then just a follow-up. Pierre, you get this question all the time about the leverage profile on
the balance sheet, but the net debt continues to fall. The ratio of your free cash flow annualized in not a
great year to net debt is like 1.5x. Is there a level of net debt that you think is underlevered or suboptimal
for the business, especially in the context of Tengiz? If the biggest impact is a return impairment, you can
enhance that to the equity with some leverage deployed somehow. So just your thoughts on how net debt
is trending and what optimal leverage is.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. No. Thanks, Sam. Look, yes, we are generating good cash in a challenging macro environment. I
think you know our 4 financial priorities. I'll go through them quickly. The first is to sustain and grow the
dividend. And we increased it 6% earlier this year. The second is to reinvest capital in the business. And
you heard Jay reaffirm our capital guidance. So we are not going to add to our capital program. The third
is to maintain a strong balance sheet. And that's what you're asking. I'll get to that. And the fourth is our
buyback program that we intend to sustain through the cycle. And we have that at a $5 billion annual
rate.
So what happens in the short term? Clearly, if we generate more cash than those 3 requirements, in
particular, the dividend, which we increased earlier this year or the capital program, which we're holding
flat and the buyback program, then it goes to the balance sheet. That's where it's going to go in the short
term. That's just how the math works. But over time, we expect, if those conditions continue, without
speculating about future dividend increases or share buybacks, over time, that cash should be returned to
shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained buyback program because, as you say, we
don't need to be an even stronger credit. We have the leading balance sheet in the industry. We have the
strongest balance sheet in the industry. And I've talked about a gross debt to capital ratio of 20% to 25%.
We're well below that. I'm comfortable being below that because that's again the outcome of our cash
generation profile. Depending on where the macro environment, obviously, that can change, but we are
very well positioned to grow dividends, sustain the buyback, invest in the business and maintain a strong
balance sheet.
Operator
And our final question for today comes from the line of Jason Gabelman of Cowen.
Jason Daniel Gabelman
Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division
I just want to firstly quickly confirm that 2019 CapEx hasn't changed as a result of the TCO overspend.
And then secondly, I just wanted to get your thoughts on M&A that hasn't been addressed on this call. I
think in the past you've discussed wanting to kind of expand or potentially acquire some company that
operates in multiple arenas, not just one that operates in U.S. shale. I'm wondering if that's still the way
you're thinking about M&A and how the opportunity set looks right now.
Pierre R. Breber

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 18
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL | NOV 01, 2019
Yes. Thanks, Jason. On your first question on capital for this year, our capital budget on an organic basis
is $20 billion. Year-to-date, we're at $14.5 billion. So we're basically on track. We've had some modest
inorganic capital year-to-date. That's been the Pasadena refinery primarily and we guided to a little bit for
the Brazil exploration bid round. So again, we're on track for delivering an organic capital program in line
with our budget of $20 billion.
In terms of M&A, I'm not going to speculate on that. I think you've heard us talk about it. Look, we have a
very strong value proposition. We have a 4% dividend yield, a 2% share buyback or a buyback equivalent
to 2% of the shares, a free cash flow yield of 7%, an advantaged portfolio that Jay has been talking about
with strong resources and reserves that allow us to grow cash flow and grow production over time. So we
don't need to do a deal. All that said, at times in the past, we have been opportunistic when we think it's
in the interest of our shareholders. It is difficult to make M&A work for our shareholders. And right now,
we think we have a very good value proposition on our own for our shareholders.
Operator
And I'd like to hand it back to you for any further remarks.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Well, that concludes our prepared remarks. Now that's the end of the call. Thank you very much.

Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded. I would now turn the conference call over to the General Manager of Investor Relations
of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Wayne Borduin. Please go ahead.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call
with me today are Jay Johnson, EVP of Upstream; and Pierre Breber, CFO. We'll refer to the slides that are
available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and
other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for
investors and stockholders on Slide 2.
Turning to Slide 3. And Pierre?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Wayne. We had another solid quarter. The company delivered record production led by continued
strength in the Permian Basin and at Wheatstone in Australia. Jay will provide more detail shortly.
First, an overview of our financial results. Earnings were $4.3 billion or $2.27 per share. This is the highest
reported quarterly result since the third quarter 2014 when Brent was over $100 a barrel. The quarter's
results include special item gains totaling $920 million from the Anadarko termination fee and a tax rate
change in Alberta. Foreign exchange gains for the quarter were $15 million. Excluding special items and FX
gains, earnings were $3.4 billion or $1.77 per share.
A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash flow from operations was almost $8 billion, excluding working capital changes. We also maintained
a strong balance sheet with a low debt ratio. Importantly, our continued strong cash flow allowed us to
deliver on our commitment to return significant cash to our shareholders.
During the quarter, we paid over $2 billion in dividends. And after terminating our agreement with
Anadarko, we resumed buybacks and repurchased $1 billion of shares during the quarter. Going forward,
we expect share buybacks at the $5 billion annual run rate or $1.25 billion per quarter in line with our
updated guidance stated in May.
We also continued to maintain capital discipline with a focus on increasing returns. Year-to-date organic
CapEx was $9.6 billion, a little less than half of our $20 billion budget. Total CapEx, which includes
acquisition costs that are unbudgeted such as the purchase of the Pasadena refinery, totaled $10 billion.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash flow was strong and the trend is in line with full year guidance. Cash flow from
operations, excluding working capital increased this quarter due to growing production volumes and
higher liquids realizations as well as the termination fee received from Anadarko. Free cash flow excluding
working capital increased to $4.3 billion and supported the dividend, debt reduction and share buybacks.
The company's cash flow breakeven remains in the low 50s on a Brent basis year-to-date.
Asset sales proceeds added to our positive cash flow and further lowered the breakeven while high grading
our portfolio. Since the beginning of 2018, asset sale proceeds have totaled $2.9 billion, and we remain on
track to divest $5 billion to $10 billion of assets by 2020.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter 2019 earnings of $4.3 billion increased about $900 million versus the
prior year. Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was
offset by lower realizations. Downstream earnings also were relatively flat as timing effects were offset by
lower margins. The variance in the Other segment was primarily the result of lower corporate charges.
Turning to Slide 6. Compared to the first quarter, second quarter earnings increased by about $1.7 billion.
Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were roughly flat as higher liftings in crude realizations
were offset by lower gas realizations, higher DD&A and other expenses. Australia gas realizations
were lower primarily due to lower LNG spot prices and a higher ratio of spot LNG sales while U.S. gas
realizations reflected weaker Henry Hub and Waha pricing. Downstream earnings excluding FX improved
by about $520 million due to stronger U.S. West Coast refining and marketing margins and timing effects,
partly offset by the impacts of planned downtime. The variance in the Other segment largely reflects lower
corporate charges.
I'll now pass it to Jay.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Thanks, Pierre.
On Slide 7, second quarter oil equivalent production increased 9% compared to a year ago with shale and
tight production increasing in the Delaware and Midland basins and production for major capital projects
increasing with ramp-ups at Wheatstone, Hebron and Big Foot. Our base business production increased as
Gulf of Mexico and other deepwater brownfield developments more than offset natural declines across the
portfolio.
Turning to Slide 8. Second quarter production was strong at more than 3 million barrels a day for the third
straight quarter. Year-to-date production excluding asset sales is about 5% higher than 2018, consistent
with our guidance of 4% to 7% growth as shown by the middle bar. Second quarter production was
impacted by planned turnarounds and asset sales, which together had an impact of almost 70,000 barrels
a day.
Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect production growth to be primarily driven by our
shale and tight assets as well as a continued ramp-up of Big Foot and Hebron. This growth will be partially
offset by higher turnaround activity in the third quarter. Our full year outlook is expected to be in line with
its guidance even before adjusting for the entitlement impacts of higher prices.
Let's turn to the Permian. In the next 3 slides, I'll provide some additional information regarding the
attractive performance and the potential of this asset. Permian shale and tight production continues to
track the guidance we provided at our 2019 Security Analyst Meeting. In the second quarter, production
was 421,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day, an increase of over 150,000 barrels a day or about
55% relative to the same quarter last year. This strong performance demonstrates our track record of
consistent execution, and we expect to deliver 900,000 barrels per day in 2023 with a relatively steady rig
count.
Moving to the mix of crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. About 3/4 of our Permian production is liquids, and
1/2 of our production is crude oil. We expect these proportions to continue throughout the forecasted
period.
As discussed in the past, we have an advantaged royalty position across the Permian, and it's comprised
of 2 distinct components. First, we have a royalty benefit shown in the dotted blue wedge as our actual
royalty rate is lower than the standard royalty rate. The second component comes from the royalty
barrels shown by the hashed blue wedge, which are the barrels we receive from the acreage that we've
leased to other producers. And of course, these barrels require no Chevron capital. In total, these royalty
contributions make up about 20% of our production throughout the 5-year period and contribute to
delivering our expected production profile.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
Let's turn to Slide 10. Our work to reduce unit cost and increase productivity continues. We're optimizing
our Permian factory and maintaining our focus on delivering industry-leading returns. This slide shows the
progress we've made since 2016. As shown on the left, we continue to drive higher EURs by optimizing
well spacing, landing zones and completions. The average lateral length of our wells continues to
increase and is expected to approach 10,000 feet next year as we execute our core-up strategy for our
development areas.
As illustrated in the upper right, these efforts translate into a sustained reduction in unit development and
production costs. The chart on the lower right shows that the royalty benefit alone leads to returns that
are about 10 percentage points higher than a comparable well subject to the standard royalty burden.
As we've said before, our strategy in the Permian is to be highly competitive in our execution, leverage
our midstream capability and use our advantaged royalty position to make us the clear leader in financial
returns.
Slide 11 shows that we're well on our way. As stated in March, we expect to be free cash flow positive next
year, and we expect to grow free cash flow each year thereafter. Earnings are expected to strengthen,
exceeding $4 billion in 2023. All of this assumes the same reference prices communicated at our 2019
Security Analyst Meeting.
As the Permian production increases, we expect to see operational cash flow nearly twice the level of C&E
by 2023 and a return on capital employed of about 30%, all delivered by an optimized, ratable factory
with relatively low execution risk. To more than double production while being free cash flow positive every
year starting next year and generate returns on capital in excess of 20% along the way shows why this is
an attractive investment opportunity for our company and its shareholders. We're focused on value, not
volume, and our true measure of success is building a sustainable business with strong free cash flow and
growing returns.
Let's turn to Slide 12. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a robust portfolio that's performing well, generates
good value and has attractive investment opportunities at each stage of development. We have a strong
queue of exploration prospects that we're actively evaluating and maturing.
Earlier this year, we participated in the Blacktip exploration well, which resulted in a discovery near
Perdido and Whale. The well encountered more than 400 feet of net pay and is within tieback distance.
Whale and Ballymore are progressing through the appraisal phase to further assess the size of the
resource. As mentioned in March, we're targeting unit development cost of $16 to $20 a barrel for new
developments in the Gulf of Mexico.
Anchor continues to progress towards FID, which is expected by early next year. The technology we're
developing to exploit these higher-pressure reservoirs will allow us to target other resource opportunities
in the Gulf of Mexico.
At Mad Dog 2, drilling and fabrication is progressing as planned, and the project is expected to deliver first
oil in 2021. And we expect Big Foot and Stampede to increase production as we bring on additional wells.
We're also pursuing highly economic brownfield developments at existing assets such as Jack/St. Malo and
Perdido. With our leading technology, experienced workforce and broad portfolio, we're continuing to add
value in the Gulf of Mexico.
Turning to Slide 13. I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan again in June, and we continue to make
good progress with the future growth wellhead pressure management project at Tengiz. The project is now
65% complete and remains on track for first oil in 2022. As we discussed at the March analyst meeting,
this is another critical year for the project as we're fully engaged with module fabrication, transportation
and installation, and that's our first full year of mechanical, electrical and instrumentation work at site.
Detailed engineering and procurement are almost complete, reducing the risk of further impact on
fabrication and construction activities. We're on schedule to close out work at 3 of the 4 fabrication yards
this year. The logistics system is working well, and modules are being delivered, restacked and set on
foundations.

As reported in the media on June 29, one of our contractors at the 3GP site experienced an interpersonal
conflict that resulted in the suspension of construction activity at the site for several days. Production
operations and other FGP sites were not affected by the incident. And overall, the event is expected to
have a relatively minor impact on project progress. With respect to construction, we're just under 40%
complete. Looking ahead, our focus continues to shift to productivity at site where we're seeing good
performance from our workforce and steady improvement in productivity.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Pierre.
Pierre R. Breber

Thanks, Jay.
Slide 14 highlights some recent commercial developments. First, through our joint venture, Chevron
Phillips Chemical Company, we announced 2 new petrochemical investments, one in the U.S. Gulf
Coast and one in Qatar. Each is in a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum. The long-term fundamentals
of chemicals are strong. We believe these projects offer attractive returns underpinned by advantaged
feedstock, world-class scale and leading technology.
Also in the quarter, we closed the sale of our interest in Denmark and executed an agreement to sell our
U.K. Central North Sea fields, which we expect to close later this year. Additionally, we completed our
acquisition of the Pasadena refinery, which will enable us to supply more of our retail market in the region
and process more domestic light oil. In the renewable space, we recently agreed to purchase wind power
to supply our Permian operations. This is a cost-effective renewable energy alternative to our current
electricity supply in the Permian. Also Chevron executed an agreement to be an equity partner in CalBio
gas, a joint venture to produce and market dairy biomethane as a vehicle fuel in California. The project
will capture methane that otherwise would be vented to the atmosphere and process it into renewable
natural gas.
Turning to Slide 15. Our performance this quarter reinforces 4 key messages you've heard from us in the
past. First, we have an advantaged portfolio that is delivering today and is positioned to do so over the
long term, as Jay highlighted in the Permian, Gulf of Mexico and at Tengiz. Second, with continued positive
free cash flow this year, we have the strongest balance sheet in the industry, a low cash breakeven and
resilience if prices fall. Third, we are disciplined with capital spending, on track with our budget and
committed to increasing returns. And fourth, we have a total cash yield of about 6% with the resumption
of our share buybacks.
Bottom line, we are positioned to deliver superior financial performance to our shareholders consistently
for many years to come.
Now looking ahead. [indiscernible] we continue to expect...

In upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7%, excluding 2019 asset sales.
Planned turnarounds in Kazakhstan, Nigeria and the North West Shelf in Australia as well as the early
July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to impact production in the third quarter. Our full year
guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion, dependent upon price investment profile and its
dividends. In downstream, we expect high level of refinery turnaround activity in the third quarter, which
guides to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million. For the third quarter, we
expect a repurchase -- we expect to repurchase shares at a rate of $1.2 billion per quarter.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
So I guess first question, just looking at this Permian additional disclosure and your cash flow
expectations, it seems like what you're implying here is that you can grow earnings and cash flow and the
ratio of cash flow to CapEx keeps going up. So it seems to imply a pretty flattish CapEx profile, which I
think is fairly consistent with the rig count trajectory you talked about at Analyst Day. So I was wondering
if maybe you could just kind of walk through that detail.
And then secondarily with -- related to that, I know you recently had an announcement that you made
with Enterprise talking about takeaway out of the Permian. I was just wondering how that all feeds into
this ability to ensure you get the best realizations for your production.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Okay. I'll take it and Pierre may want to add in some at the end. From a CapEx standpoint, Phil, we are
looking to maintain a relatively flat profile in capital, and that's because essentially, we're looking to have
a very steady rig fleet as we go forward. We have 20 company-operated rigs. Those are basically on a
100% basis because we operate our own licenses. And then we look for about 30 roughly gross non-
operated rigs, which equates to about 7 to 10 net nonoperated rigs.
So as we move that forward we expect to see capital relatively constant. We're building out infrastructure,
of course, and we always have some exploration activity out in front of us, and we also do pilot work to
ensure that we're continuing to drive to increase the recovery and efficiency of our developments.
In terms of the takeaway capacity, I'll break it into 3 different streams. I'll start with the crude oil. And
basically for 2019, we're well covered on our takeaway capacity for crude oil. In 2020, we are also covered
for the year. There may be periods of tightness in length as we move through the year, but we recently
executed an agreement with Enterprise, not only for takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin but
also for export capacity that will lengthen our ability to supply crude not only in the domestic U.S. but
internationally.
When we look at natural gas liquids, we have full takeaway capacity for this year and next year. And as
we turn to gas, we really think of gas in 2 ways. The first is just basic flow assurance. We need to be able
to move the gas without having to flare or have any threat of mitigating production in our avoidance of
flaring. So we have 100% flow assurance set up for the balance of this year and next year. In terms of
takeaway of gas from the basin outward for export, what we look at is, this year, we're at about 20% of
our gas can be exported from the basin. And by the end of this year, we expect to be about 25%. By the
end of next year, we should be more like 60% of our gas being exported from the basin gives us more
exposure to other price structures rather than just the Waha.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. Great. Just my follow-up question then for Pierre would just be some of your balance sheet
commentary. Your net debt to cap, I believe, is at lowest since it has been since mid-2015. I know you
increased the buyback a bit. There was the situation where you had an M&A consideration there that you
walked away from, but I guess how do you think about that level of financial leverage? And where you
want to keep that balance sheet for opportunities that might present themselves?

VP & CFO
Look, our cash generation has been strong, and we've been returning cash to shareholders, and we
increased our dividend 6% early this year. As you mentioned, we raised our guidance on the share
buyback rate in May to $5 billion per year. We're being very disciplined with capital managing to our
$20 billion organic budget in 2019. So the way the math works, no doubt in the short term, our strong
balance sheet gets even stronger. That's okay. Over time, this strong cash generation will be returned
to shareholders in the form of higher dividends and a sustained share buyback program. That's the
way I would think about it. I won't comment on M&A. We obviously have -- we're in a very financially
strong position, at the same time we've got a great value proposition for our shareholders that we've
communicated at our March Analyst Day, and then Jay provided more insight into some key elements
today, and that's what we're focused on delivering.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
I guess the first question I have, Jay, you just came back from Kazakhstan, sounds like. There are some
questions around labor productivity as it relates to Tengiz. Can you just confirm everything is on track and
then just in terms of the capital budget as well your confidence level in achieving the targets that you set
out?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. So we just did come back. We were there in June. And we talked about this at the Security Analyst
Meeting and in previous calls. A big focus at site now is on labor productivity. We've got a lot of work to
do as the modules come in are set on foundations. Last year, we were primarily focused on civils and
undergrounds. This year, we're making the transition to mechanical, electrical and instrumentation. As
we look forward, we have to get through commissioning and then all the start-up activities. So we've
put in place specific tools that can really help us not only drive the productivity but understand what
the drivers are, where we have gaps from where our expectations are and what we need to do to close
those. Those tools are now widespread across the site and are proving to be very effective so we've seen
steadily improving productivity across the workforce and are actually feeling pretty good about where the
execution is headed at this point. But it's early days. We're 40% roughly complete on construction, and
we've got a lot of man-hours to go over the next couple of years.
In terms of the overall capital program, you've seen we continue to be right in the middle, right on our
guidance. We're about 50% expended on our Chevron C&E through mid-year, and we still expect to
maintain our guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion for next year, so that should give you a pretty good idea
of where things sit.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Appreciate this. A follow-up question, this might be for you, Pierre. You've gotten a lot of credit from
investors for stepping away from the Anadarko potential transaction and showing the capital discipline.
Now since the deal closed, the stock has materially outperformed other constituents of the XLE or XOP, the
others, independent E&Ps and that multiple arbitrage or share price ratio arbitrage seems to be opening
up again. Just want to get your thoughts on M&A. Again, it felt opportunistic but is another opportunity
potentially opening up here?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Neil. Look I obviously can't speculate on M&A. What I can restate is we have a very
strong value proposition for our shareholders. And if I can just -- some of the key elements that we

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
communicated in March is 3% to 4% production growth guidance through 2023, a very disciplined capital
program. Jay provided the 2020 guidance of $18 billion to $20 billion and longer-term guidance of $19
billion to $22 billion from 2021 to 2023. We have leading upstream cash flow margins, leading earnings
margins, and we're improving cash return on capital employed by more than 3%. So we clearly do
not need to do a deal. That said, as you said, we have been opportunistic in the past if we see a good
strategic fit at a good price, at a good value. And 2 recent examples would be the Pasadena refinery and
Anadarko, but we've moved on and we're focused on delivering -- growing earnings and cash flows for our
shareholders.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Alastair Syme from Citi.
Alastair R Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
I just had a couple of questions. One, can you talk a little bit about Anchor, which you're hoping to FID
next year? What do you think has to happen to move that forward? Because my understanding is there's
still quite significant technological challenges. And the follow-up if you can just talk a little bit -- it's just
sort of a question just on the asset sales that you announced, the U.K. asset sales in the quarter. Can you
talk about what happens on the decommissioning liabilities associated with those assets, please?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. So with Anchor, we are in the FID process so this is doing all the preliminary engineering work prior to
the detailed engineering. I would say there are 2 primary technologies to be developed to support Anchor.
And in developing for Anchor, we'll also have these available for other opportunities that we foresee. The
first is just the high-pressure technology getting to the 20,000 psi. That's well along, and we really --
it really comes down to just thicker steel. We're in the qualification stages and we really don't see that
as a major technology shift. It's just a matter of working through the process, and the second is the
higher hook loads for deeper wells, and this will also support potential developments like Ballymore. So
neither of those do we regard as a particularly challenging technological advance but an important one
to get finished. So we do expect to be on path with Anchor for FID early in the next year. In terms of the
North Sea deal, we really don't get into the details of any of our commercial transactions, so I can't really
comment too much on that other than to say, as an overall package, we're very comfortable with the
transaction as it's been constructed and are working with the buyer to move it forward to close.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. And I think I can add to Jay's comments that we're fully in tune with the importance of abandonment
obligations, and that's carefully considered in terms of the financial strength of the partners or the parties
that we transact with. And again, we won't be specific as it's commercially sensitive, but as you can
imagine, the point of negotiation and something that we don't intend to be exposed to over time.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
Apologies if I missed this, I was cut off the call, but I have a question on LNG. You mentioned a higher
ratio of spot details in the quarter. Could you just talk through what was driving that? One of your peers
has talked about buyers for their contracts not taking their full nominations. So I was wondering if that
was the issue or there's something else there.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
I'll talk first in general because there's an element of -- as we gain in our performance, the facilities
are performing very well, reliability is coming up, we have extra production over and above what we
had planned, and so all that production is going to be exposed to spot prices. And so that's going to
be an ongoing thing. In the second quarter specifically, we certainly had excellent performance at both
Gorgon and Wheatstone, and so we had extra production coming from that. But at the same time, we also
deferred a turnaround so we had a turnaround scheduled in the second quarter that's been moved to the
fourth, so we had extra cargoes there that were exposed to spot. We do have some downward flex that
was exercised by some of our purchasers in the shoulder months, and that occurred in the second quarter.
And then finally, there's also an element even in our fixed-term contracts where we had about a 3- to 6-
month delay in the oil pricing that they're linked to, and so we saw some downward movement in that
element. So together, those all really drive the realizations in the second quarter for our LNG. But as I say,
going forward, we do expect to see increased production as our reliability's been higher, and our overall
goal would be to term that up and get closer to what our expected production is as we gain continued
confidence in the reliability of the facilities.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
That's great color. Just a quick follow-up. At Gorgon, in particular, I think in the past you may have talked
about debottlenecking the project increased capacity by maybe 10% or 15%. Can you just update us on
where we are now relative to the original nameplate?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes. I don't recall us giving out specific guidance on percentages of increase. Our focus right now is on
doing a couple of things. That's -- first is just getting the reliability increasingly high, and we've seen very
good reliability. We're still learning these facilities as they continue to operate, and we build learnings
from some of the shutdowns and turnarounds that we've already accomplished into future ones. As we
look forward, what we are looking at is we're collecting the data literally daily as we move through an
annual cycle of the ambient conditions as well as the performance of the plant. We look for where the
restrictions that keep us from going to that next level of production. At this point in time, I'd say we're
probably 2% above where we expected to be on Gorgon production, around 6% above on Wheatstone, but
it's an ongoing effort as we move forward to get more out of our existing investments and infrastructure.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jon Rigby from UBS.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Two, please. The first is the Anadarko transaction during that process, I felt that you sort of indicated
that you had capacity and the willingness to sort of deepen your deepwater participation globally, and you
spoke quite enthusiastically about adding extra LNG to your portfolio, creating a global position, et cetera.
So as you move forward with new opportunities as and when they arise, thematically outside of the U.S.,
is that where we should expect you to be appearing or looking? And then the second, just very specifically
with the new refinery asset, what are the plans for that now you've got ownership of it?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Jon. This is Pierre, and I'll start. I said earlier we moved on, but it looks like we'll go back to
Anadarko a little bit here. Look, there were several elements of it, the transaction. There was the FID in
the Permian, there was the FID in the Gulf of Mexico, and there was the LNG. And there was the ability
to get synergies out of the transaction and do it at an attractive price that we thought was good for their
shareholders and good for our shareholders. So that -- if you want to get into our thinking, we -- adding
LNG is something that absolutely we are interested in doing. We've got a great position in Australia that
Jay just talked about that's generating a lot of cash where we have opportunities to debottleneck and
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
potentially add to that over time. And you'd expect that we are -- we're always working the portfolio, and
LNG is one of the asset classes that we're interested in, and we'll pursue opportunities in that space. That
makes sense for the company and our shareholders.
In terms of Pasadena, we've had 3 very clear strategic objectives on it. One was to provide some equity
product into our retail network in Texas. The second was to coordinate and optimize feedstocks and
other flows between Texas and our refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. And the third was to process more
domestic light oil and increasingly, try to position and retool the refinery a little bit to take more and more
Permian oil. So really, I mean, it's very early days, but I'd say everything is on track and aligned with the
strategic rationale. So there's been no surprises in terms of those 3 objectives. We feel we can meet them
with the acquisition. We've had some early wins. In fact, over the next few months, we expect to run up
to 30,000 barrels a day of Permian crude oil. That's a little more than we actually had thought at this point
in time. Also we know there's work to do as expected on maintenance and reliability of the facility. So
everything is on track, and we feel good about it, but it's early days.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I had a couple on the Permian Slide #10. I guess the first one would be obviously some fairly impressive,
absolute performance in increasing EUR and decreasing development production cost on an absolute basis.
I know you did a lot of benchmarking. How would you say you stack up against industry in those areas
now?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, that's a good question, Jason. I think the -- we do, do a lot of benchmarking, and this continues to be
an evolving story. So I would say we're competitive on these areas. We have a very good understanding,
particularly in terms of the type curves across the entire basin. We have the capability and actually run
decline curves across not only our own but competitors' wells so that we understand how our wells are
performing, and we're actually very comfortable with the overall performance not only in terms of the
recoveries but the economics that we're generating from the execution work. And then when that's
coupled up with our ability to use our midstream capability and our royalty position, it's really giving us, I
would say, leading financial performance overall.
So if you went back and looked at our Security Analyst Meeting slides, we showed you some of the
competitor data. We also showed you how our actual type curves are performing relative to our
expectations, and they're very tightly coupled. So I think we have a good understanding, but we're seeing
that continued improvement as we move forward.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. The only thing I would add to Jay's comments -- this is, Pierre. Look, I mean, you can cherry pick
a lot of data out there to position how you look. We've been pretty consistent with what we've shown.
And also we've done a lot, not just general benchmarking by comparisons to our non-op partners or the
operators on our behalf where we know we have very good apples-to-apples data. So it is an area of,
focus and we feel we compete very well.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-up, I noticed that the average lateral length that's planned for
2020 is starting to approach 10,000 feet. In the past, you've had fairly frequently slides about swapping
another positioning to kind of block up your acreage. And if you're moving towards 10,000 feet, I'm

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
suspecting you're getting a long ways towards doing that, but can you just kind of talk about whether
there's further opportunity there?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, as we continue -- in the existing development areas, we are getting higher and higher on our
average lateral length and approaching that 10,000-foot mark. In the areas that we've transacted, we
had about 60,000 acres that we transacted in 2017 and 95,000 acres in 2018. Those enabled are about
1,900 longer laterals, so it's really helped us in our core-up development areas. As we continue though to
open up new development areas, we're going to continue to have this land activity as we optimize our land
positions. So about half of our acreage overall we consider to be in very highly productive areas. And what
we'll want to do is continue to use swap-outs or swaps and farm-out sales acquisitions to continue to core
up our development areas. We try and do that in a timely manner. We don't want to get too far ahead of
ourselves, but we do want to make sure that we're drilling efficiently as we start each area. As we've said
many times, our focus is on delivering returns, not just chasing production or chasing a certain activity
level.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
I was wondering if, Jay, I could take advantage of you being on the call just a little bit in terms of the
assumptions you made in the Permian on the cash margins, things have obviously deteriorated, no fault of
your own, in terms of NGLs and gas. So if -- how do you see the prognosis there? What assumptions were
you making when you were talking about CapEx versus cash flow? And I guess kind of the last piece of
that question is 900,000 barrels a day out of 3.3, 3.4 in 2023 suggests that your cash margin across the
portfolio could move away from this sort of sector leaving [indiscernible] what you've had in the past. I'm
just curious if you can offer any thoughts on that. I've got a follow-up, please.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Well, the cash -- the assumptions that we provided are all given in our Security Analyst Meeting deck
so you can go back and reference those. And what we're trying to do is continue to make sure we have
the flow assurance, as I mentioned earlier in the call, to move gas out to other markets and not have it
captured in the immediate basin. Crude oil, we're already well ahead of that. We move our crude outside
the basin, and we can access and optimize the markets that we're reaching.
In terms of the cash margin overall, again, we've given you that information. We see that as very strong.
There's always going to be fluctuations in the market as there's tightness and length in different locations,
but overall, we feel pretty strong about where we're heading with this as a production base but also the
other production we have around the world.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. I understand. There's a lot of moving parts in that. My follow-up is kind of related, and it's --
historically, when oil prices we're a lot weaker, you guys talked routinely about what your sustaining
capital was in the portfolio. And obviously, that has been reset favorably by the very large LNG projects
and now it's kind of dominating the base decline and the lack thereof. As you move towards again
this level of having a significantly larger proportion of your production and a high decline underlying
unconventional asset base, what does that do to the sustaining capital versus, I think, you used to talk
about like a $13 billion number. How does that evolve as we move towards the 5-year plan?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
This is Pierre, and I'll start and ask Jay to add some comment. We've never really talked about sustaining
capital. We've given -- we have a $20 billion capital budget this year that we talked about, $18 billion to
$20 billion guidance next year and then $19 billion to $22 billion, 2021 to 2023. So the guidance is pretty
clear. It's pretty tight. That results in an enterprise that's growing 3% to 4% of production growth through
2023 with leading cash margins.
So the prior times we talked about the base decline. We are investing in the unconventional, as you saw
on the Permian, that it's -- the production is more than doubling while it's being free cash flow every year
starting next year at returns that are going from 20% to 30%. So we feel really good about our position.
We're not focused on keeping a base flat capital. We're focused on increasing returns. It's resulting in an
outcome of higher production that's translating to higher earnings and cash flow. But the high decline that
you referred to is that it's a nature of the business, but when you're investing in it, you can see that we're
more than offsetting that decline, and we're doing it in a very economic manner. And as we continue to fill
out facilities and keep facilities filled over time, the reinvestment is a very attractive use of capital for the
shareholders.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
I might just build on what Pierre said because he's absolutely right. As we have a larger percentage of
our overall production constrained by facilities. It means we have the ability to be very stable in our
production. And the same in some respects actually applies in the Permian. While any individual well may
have a relatively high decline rate, it does approach an asymptotic curve, but the facilities we install for
each of the development areas, our goal is to keep those full. And one of the advantages of the Permian
is that in the initial drilling, we fill the facilities up, but then we can go back to infill drilling programs
and by going after the subsequent benches in a given development area and just continue to keep those
facilities full. And the amount of rig activity it takes is much less for those subsequent drilling campaigns
to maintain that production in a given development area. So I actually feel pretty good about where the
whole portfolio has moved and really, I'm not too worried about what some people see as a problem with
these individual Permian wells.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Maybe just to dive in here, kind of following up on some of the Permian questions. With your royalty
position and others' developments and with some of the problems we're seeing from some of those E&Ps,
any risk to your outlook from those who might have overstepped their bounds in terms of the way they
were developing the Permian?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, you're right. I mean, we don't control the royalty barrels because that's
being operated by others who own the working interest. We're a landowner. And as Jay said, we receive
those barrels with no capital, no operating cost, but the flip side is that we don't control the development.
So we're doing it based on an outlook and an expectation. Certainly, we know what the actuals have been,
but you're right that there is some risk of that. It could go either way. It could go bigger or lower than
what we're showing dependent on what those operators activity levels are.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. Great. And then from a guidance standpoint on the downstream, the high refinery turnaround
activity for the third quarter. I was under the impression you'd had fairly high turnaround activity earlier in

the first half of this year. So I was just curious was that the right interpretation and maybe if there's any
geographic specific exposure on the high TARs this quarter.
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, Roger, so we have now adopted a practice of giving pretty clear guidance on planned turnaround
activity in the downstream, and we characterized it as either a low, medium or high. So you're right,
second quarter was high, and that's related to $200 million of after-tax earnings impacts both from higher
costs and from lost profit opportunity beyond volumes not produced. First quarter was actually low, which
is up to $100 million of FX. So in the third quarter, it's another high quarter. That's not unusual. It just
depends on how the planned turnarounds are set up. We won't provide specifics on the locations. It's
commercially sensitive and so it's just something that we won't do ahead of time. We're happy to talk
about it looking back. So in the second quarter, we had some planned turnaround activity in Pascagoula
and in Asia. So we can explain afterwards but we think we're giving pretty clear guidance. So you're right
that you should view the earnings -- after-tax earnings impact of planned turnarounds in 3Q to be the
same or similar to 2Q.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Howard Weil.
Paul Cheng
Scotia Howard Weil, Research Division
Jay, since you are here, and I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the incident in Tengiz
with your contractor, at least in the media it seems like they make it as may have been more serious
talking about between the foreign contractor and the local people and may even be different gender. Can
you give us a little bit more update on that and whether there's any initiatives have been taken trying to
resolve the problem there?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Yes, Paul. I can give you a little bit more. This is really centered around one particular contractor that was
at the 3GP site, and there were obviously some disagreements between some of their workers and the
management of that company. When the issue happened, we shut down the entire site, the 3GP site, not
the other site that didn't have any impact on production operations. But we wanted to make sure that the
problem was mitigated and contained, and we understood what was at the root of it. We've worked with
that contractor. They're putting in place corrective action to make sure that they deal with some of the
concerns that were there. That is the only contractor that's had an extended ramp-up so they are working
back to their normal strength, and we expect to see then that normal strength by the end of August. So
at this point in time, we don't see it as having a material impact on the overall progress of the work. That
contractor was about 1 month ahead of where we expected them to be on the workflow. So unfortunately,
we've used up some of that float that they'd built up, but we believe we're going to be able to mitigate
the impact to this. The worker and the workforce relations are always important to us, and this is one that
we continue to stay focused on. It's very important as now our focus continues to shift to site, and I can
assure you we'll stay focused with our workforce to make sure that we're trying to anticipate and deal with
any other concerns.
Paul Cheng
Scotia Howard Weil, Research Division
And the second question, Jay. I think in Angola, Block 14, I think that the expiration is 2023. And in
Nigeria, in Agbami, I think, is 2024. When you guys will start the process for renegotiation on those?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
Well, that's not something we normally are going to talk much about publicly, Paul. That's between us and
our partners and the government. So I can tell you that those discussions and the planning for that is well
in hand, but I really won't be able to go into much detail on those at this time.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
So in the Permian, one of the things that you talked about contributing to your rig count staying relatively
flat is that you're building up a nice stack of vintage wells, and you've got some legacy production that's
supporting the outperformance of the new wells. Just really quickly, Jay, can you shed some light on the
performance of those older wells, it sounds like you're leading edge wells are meeting your expectations,
but how are the vintage wells doing as far as -- how are they holding up and as they get a little longer in
the tooth?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
Actually, they're doing quite well. Our focus from day 1 has been to maximize the returns that we can
get from our investments in the Permian. So there's been a lot of questions why don't we increase our rig
fleet, why don't we be more aggressive, but the reality is we continue to learn as everyone in the industry
as we move forward, and I think a lot of the moves we've made to stay focused on returns now are paying
off. Many people talk about how high their initial production rates are and their first 6-month rates. But
what we're really looking at, that can actually damage wells and cause aggravated decline curves. So
we're are looking at the total expected recovery. We're looking at the economics of the well over its life.
We're very careful in our drawdown rates in those early months to make sure that we don't cause damage
in a wellbore or in the formation. When we put all that together, we're seeing our base production. That
is the production that's already online continuing to perform such that when we drill these new wells,
we can add that on top. And as you saw from the chart, I believe it was on probably Page 9, we've been
able to continue to deliver right on our production profile, and we feel very good about how our wells are
performing.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
And then this one should be relatively quick, just in reference to the strategic partnership between
CPChem and Qatar. Qatar has got a portfolio of other things that Chevron is probably a good candidate
to participate in. Do you see that relationship deepening as you kind of advance on the chemical side
throughout the Chevron organization? Or are you keeping that siloed into Chems?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
No. No. Look, we have a good relationship with Qatar Petroleum for sure and so does CPChem. And
when the Qataris look at CPChem, they look at it as 3 companies, right, Chevron Phillips, Phillips 66 and
ourselves. And so we have a good relationship with them. I will say that the trend -- the deals stand on
their own. I mean the project in Qatar was bid out. U.S. Gulf Coast again, there's other alternatives that
are considered. So each transaction stands on its own, but we're very proud that we have this platform
with them. And whether that leads to other opportunities or not, I won't speculate, but we certainly have a
good base to work off of.
Operator
And our final question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL | AUG 02, 2019
You alluded to the gas takeaway issues in the Permian and that you were trying to avoid flaring as much
as possible. But of course, your realized gas price was $0.60 in Q2. So I'm curious if it might get to a point
where you have no practical choice but to either flare gas or shut in wells. And if that happens, which
would you choose?
James William Johnson
Executive Vice President of Upstream
We don't flare. We are not flaring and we haven't flared. Our policy is that we find flow assurance, as I
said, is our first priority so that we can move the gas, and we've been doing that. And we've got that flow
assurance covered, so I don't see us being forced into the choices that you just presented. I do -- as I
said earlier, we're going to be increasing the amount of export capacity out of the basin to try and achieve
better realizations, and that's part of our overall strategy to maximize the returns that we can get from
our investments in the Permian.
Pavel S. Molchanov
Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division
Okay. And then based on what I just asked but taking a much broader perspective, you're talking
about reducing carbon emissions. Just about every other U.S. oil and gas producers talking about the
same, when we listen to what's being said onstage at the debates, as I'm sure you saw this week, that
point seems to be lost on the policy community. And I'm curious what you think the industry has not
communicated that is -- or what the dynamic is that has led to this disconnect between what you're saying
and what the policymakers seem to be believing.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Well, Sam, that's a big last question on the call here. Look, I mean, it depends which policymakers, right?
We're in the midst of an energy revolution renaissance here in the United States. For sure, wind and
solar is a big part of that but what's going on in the Permian basin, what's happened in the Marcellus and
Utica and growing natural gas production, growing crude oil production, exports to world markets and
all the geopolitical implications and benefits of that, you can see our President talks a lot about that. At
the same time, we share the concerns on climate change. We referred on the earnings call to a couple
of investments that lower the carbon intensity of our operations. It was wind PPA in the Permian, so we
are consumers of electricity, we are using renewable electricity there, it lowers the carbon intensity of
our operations and the renewable natural gas, which is in California, which takes methane that otherwise
would be vented to the atmosphere, processes it, puts it in the grid. Yet we have offtake agreements with
trucking companies. It generates low carbon fuel standards under the California regulatory regime. It's
modest capital. It earns an attractive return, so it's something that we believe is good for the environment
and good for our shareholders. So we'll look to do more of that. We'll be very balanced but it's a big
question and we'll be part of the conversation.
Wayne Borduin
General Manager of Investor Relations
I'd like to thank everyone for your time today. We do appreciate your interest in Chevron and everyone's
participation on today's call. Jonathan, back to you.

Presentation
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for joining Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings
Conference Call. At this time -- good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Jonathan. I will be your
conference facilitator today.
Welcome to Chevron's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder,
this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to the Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
All right. Thank you, Jonathan, and welcome back. We missed you.
I'd like to welcome everybody to Chevron's First Quarter Earnings Call and Webcast. Our new CFO, Pierre
Breber, and our Head of Investor Relations, Wayne Borduin, are on the call with me. We'll refer to the
slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and
other forward-looking statements. Please review the cautionary statement and important information for
investors and stockholders on Slide 2.
Moving to Slide 3. Today, I'll make a few opening comments. Pierre will review the first quarter results,
and then we'll take your questions.
As I've said before, we're well positioned to win in any environment. During our Security Analyst Meeting,
we shared that our advantaged portfolio, strong balance sheet and low breakeven, capital discipline
and lower execution risk position us well to deliver superior shareholder returns. With the announced
acquisition of Anadarko, our story gets even better. It builds strength on strength. We submitted our
antitrust filing yesterday to begin regulatory approvals, and we've begun joint integration planning. We
know how to integrate 2 strong companies to create an even stronger one. We've done it well on prior
transactions, and we'll do it again. We remain confident that the transaction agreed by Chevron and
Anadarko will be completed.
With that, I'll turn it over to Pierre who'll take you through the financial results.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Mike.
Turning to Slide 4. Our disciplined, returns-focused approach to the business continues to drive solid
earnings and cash flow. First quarter earnings were $2.6 billion or $1.39 per diluted share. Excluding
foreign exchange losses, earnings were $2.8 billion or $1.47 per share. Cash flow from operations for the
quarter was $5.1 billion. Excluding working capital changes, it was $6.3 billion. We maintained a strong
balance sheet with a debt ratio less than 20% at quarter-end. During the first quarter, we increased our
quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, up 6%. Share repurchases during the quarter were around $500
million, lower than our $1 billion per quarter guidance. During the quarter, we were restricted from buying
back shares in light of the Anadarko acquisition.
Turning to Slide 5. Despite lower refining and chemical margins, cash flow was solid, and the trend is
in line with full year guidance. Working capital effects in the quarter consumed $1.2 billion, generally
consistent with our seasonal pattern. Free cash flow, excluding working capital changes, was over $3
billion. Other cash flow items included pension contributions of about $325 million, asset sale proceeds of
around $300 million and TCO co-lending of $350 million.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2019
We continue to make progress high grading our portfolio. Total asset sale proceeds since the beginning of
2018 are $2.3 billion, and we remain on track to reach the low end of our current 3-year $5 billion to $10
billion guidance range by the end of this year.
Slide 6 compares first quarter 2019 earnings with first quarter 2018. Earnings declined from a year
ago, largely due to lower crude oil prices and weaker downstream and chemicals margins. Special items
increased earnings by $120 million due to the absence of a first quarter 2018 asset impairment. A swing in
foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $266 million.
Excluding special items and FX, upstream earnings were relatively flat as higher production was offset by
lower realizations. Downstream earnings decreased by about $500 million, mostly due to weaker refining
and chemicals margins coupled with unfavorable timing effects. The variance in the other segment was
primarily the result of higher corporate charges.
Turning to Slide 7. This compares results for first quarter 2019 with fourth quarter 2018. First quarter
earnings were about $1 billion lower than the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange impacts decreased
earnings by $405 million between periods. This was partially offset by the absence of a project write-
off. Excluding special items and FX, upstream results were flat between quarters. Lower realizations and
listings were offset by lower depreciation and operating expenses. Downstream earnings decreased by
about $600 million primarily due to unfavorable timing effects coupled with lower refining and marketing
margins. These impacts were partly offset by lower turnaround activity this quarter. The variance in the
other segment largely reflects an unfavorable swing in corporate tax items.
On Slide 8, first quarter 2019 oil-equivalent production increased 186,000 barrels a day or almost 7%
from first quarter 2018. Production exceeded 3 million barrels per day for the second straight quarter.
Shale and tight production increased 143,000 barrels per day. First quarter unconventional production
in the Permian was 391,000 barrels per day, in line with our guidance and up 55%. Production for major
capital projects increased by 128,000 barrels per day, primarily due to Wheatstone, Hebron and Big
Foot. Base declines were 30,000 barrels per day, net of production from new wells, notably in the Gulf of
Mexico. The effects of unplanned downtime, primarily at Gorgon, reduced production by 29,000 barrels
per day.
Now looking ahead, in upstream, we continue to expect 2019 production growth to be 4% to 7% excluding
2019 asset sales. We closed on the sale of our Denmark assets earlier this month and are evaluating
bids on our U.K. North Sea assets. Our full year guidance for TCO co-lending is unchanged at $2 billion
dependent upon price, investment profile and dividends. In downstream, we expect to close on the
purchase of the Pasadena refinery in the second quarter. We also expect high refinery turnaround activity,
which equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of more than $200 million.
For the second quarter, we expect restrictions on share repurchases to continue in light of the Anadarko
acquisition. Post-closing, we expect to buy back shares at a rate of $1.25 billion per quarter. In the second
quarter, we expect the pension contribution around $400 million. And our full year guidance for the other
segment is unchanged at $2.4 billion.
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take your questions. [Operator Instructions]
Jonathan, please open the lines.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Devin McDermott from Morgan Stanley.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
So I wanted to start because I'm sure it'll be asked if I don't, just on the Anadarko deal and the process
there. Appreciate the additional color in the prepared remarks. I guess first, can you just walk through,
remind us what the time line is in key milestones and process from here? And any comments you could
make on the competing offer from Oxy would be helpful as well. I'll leave it to you to answer that how
you'd like.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. So the time line is probably a little different today than I would have told you a couple of weeks
ago because we now have Anadarko's Board back considering unsolicited proposal. We made our Hart-
Scott-Rodino filing. I mentioned that, that went in yesterday. We don't see any material antitrust or
anticompetitive issues that arise from the combination, and so we would expect that to be handled within
a pretty reasonable period of time, say 60 days. It depends if they come back for a second review with
any questions. And then we have an Anadarko shareholder vote that will be scheduled and could result
in a third quarter close. So I think we've always said second half of this year. And so that would be the
time line. I think we're going to wait and see what -- the Anadarko Board has said they're reviewing this
unsolicited offer, and so we'll -- that obviously will have some bearing on the overall time line.
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Understood. Makes sense.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Thanks, Devin. Do you have a follow-up?
Devin J. McDermott
Morgan Stanley, Research Division
Yes, one follow-up. Just wanted to switch over to TCO and the co-lending. You mentioned the guidance
there is unchanged. But any color you can give us just on the shaping and how we should think about that
playing out throughout the year?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, Devin, this is Pierre. I mean you should view it as roughly ratable. And -- but again, it will vary
depending on prices and project spending and affiliate dividends. But if you think of it being roughly
ratable during the course of the year, that's appropriate at this point in time.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2019
First question. In light of the competing bid that's put out there and the details behind that, I think one
thing that surprised investors would be perhaps the degree of synergies that Oxy talked about in their
proposed transaction even if you back out the capital reduction component. And so I think you've been
asked about the degree of conservatism already to some degree about your synergy forecast. But now
that, that's out there, I was just wondering if maybe you'd have a comment about your numbers and
where upside could come from.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure, Phil. So look, I'm not going to comment on the details of another offer. I'll tell you our synergies
are real, and we're confident in our ability to achieve the $2 billion in run rate synergies in the first year
post close and delivering significant value from the deal. As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun joint
integration meetings with Anadarko. We have full teams from both companies meeting for multiple days
this week already. We're committed to delivering the synergies. We've got a strong history of successfully
integrating 2 companies and meeting and often exceeding our synergy targets. This can go back to Gulf,
it can go to Texaco, it can go to Unocal. And so this is something we've done before, and we're very good
at it. We're very confident that we can deliver the $2 billion. And as we -- we know what we know at this
point. And as we get more detail, we certainly will know more. The other thing that I'll just mention is we
have great confidence that we can accelerate value realization in the Permian, which is not really reflected
in the cost synergies. We have indicated that we can see increased capital spending and increased activity
in the Permian. We've got a strong, contiguous position that results from this transaction. We've got
a royalty position that we can accelerate value from, and we will absolutely be able to deliver strong
performance out of there. We benchmark very aggressively in the Permian on a virtually continuous basis.
We benchmark well performance, well design, completion design, execution performance, cycle time,
service facilities, efficiency, OpEx, unit cost, realization, all the financial metrics, and do that on a regular
basis. And we have a strong performing Permian business that will bring realizations and value forward
that is not in that $2 billion. And so I think you can feel very confident that we will deliver. And as we see
more value there, we will be talking to you about it.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay, fair enough. Just a follow-up question would be, obviously, there's more to an acquisition than just
the price offered. And I was hoping maybe could help us think through why your lower-priced offer should
win from your perspective? And if Anadarko's Board is forced to go back and quantitatively decide that
this is -- your offer is not good enough, is there a point at which -- that you look at this and not consider
raising a bid because it's returns disruptive to you to do so?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Sure. Well, I won't speak for the Anadarko Board. But even with the information that was made public
this week, our offer was viewed by Anadarko as superior. And we have a signed merger agreement
approved unanimously by the boards of both companies. We strongly believe that the combination of our 2
companies create superior long-term value for shareholders of the combined company. The industrial logic
of our transaction is very compelling. Anadarko's assets further strengthen already leading positions that
we have in large and attractive shale, deepwater and natural gas basins. It enables further portfolio high-
grading cost reductions and focused investment in an even stronger company. Our financial position and
balance sheet strength enables us to take on the leverage and issue the additional equity and still continue
to increase shareholder distributions. Our company simply have the best strategic fit. We can operate in
the Gulf of Mexico in ways that others cannot. We're a world-class operator of LNG. We've got leading
performance in many different dimensions in the Permian, and that strong balance sheet mitigates risk.
We won't be over-levered coming out of the deal. We'll be financially strong with accretive cash flow and
earnings and full-on certain value. There's no shareholder vote required to approve the transaction, and
there's strong upside on what is already a very strong currency in Chevron stock. So I think there are a
whole host of reasons why we have a very compelling transaction.

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
Mike, when we think about the potential for you to bid higher, we look at your balance sheet and
obviously, there's a tremendous amount of firepower there, but we suspect it's not how you would be
looking at potentially adding to your bid. Can you talk about the metrics that you're looking at in terms of
Anadarko value to Chevron?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. And I want to close off, Phil actually asked a question that I failed to get to at the end of that
last answer which kind of ties to this. And Phil, yes, there is -- we've been very disciplined as we've
approached this, as we've looked at valuation. And I think you said, is there a point at which you're done?
And of course, the answer to that is yes, there is, and this isn't the time to address that specifically.
But we've said we will do things that are value creating for our shareholders, and we don't need to do
anything. We've got a very strong story without doing a transaction. So Paul, to your question, we look
at a whole host of metrics, and some of the primary ones are the accretion metrics. Does this give us
accretive free cash flow after capital spending? Does it give us accretive earnings? Do we get a strong
return on this investment? And does it give us the investment queue, the investment set and opportunities
over time to continue to improve return on capital, which the entire industry is working to improve. And
this does -- it gives us over 10 billion barrels of resource at less than $3 a barrel, which is an attractive
resource acquisition cost. And so there are a whole host of metrics like that, that are the ones that we look
at.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, and Paul, I don't know if your question was getting to the mix of the equity in cash. I mean we've
talked about the 75-25 was mutually agreed to. Anadarko shareholders wanted exposure to our stock.
We have very good stock. But clearly, we have the capacity to have alternative structures. We could put
more -- we could have put more cash in if that's what Anadarko wanted to do, but we agreed to where we
ended up.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
Yes, I realize, Mike, that you've talked about free cash flow at some point [indiscernible] cash flow-
accretive. [indiscernible] previously mentioned, from your point of view, it seems to be the single metric
that we should look at. We're just wondering how to think about it.
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
So Paul, sorry, was there another follow-up question in there?
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
No, I think that the other aspect was that you said [indiscernible] is obviously a tough thing to measure,
but it does seem that you have a great fit. Could you talk a little bit about Mozambique and how you see
that? I think that's one of the differentiators between -- potentially between you and Oxy.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL | APR 26, 2019
Sure. As I discussed on the call a couple of weeks ago, we view Mozambique as a world-class gas
resource. We are pleased with the progress the project has made. It's a very cost-competitive LNG
project, and that matters. We do not intend to slow the project time line down. We think that there's a
good team of people working on this, and that they've been a good job. I plan to visit Mozambique soon
to see the sights and visit with both government leaders and people working on the project there, and we
think this fits well into our portfolio and with our strengths, and so we like the project. We think we can
bring some value. We've got a balance sheet to support the project. We've got experience in things like
shipping that this will have a large shipping component. So I think there are ways we can improve and
enhance execution and value and mitigate risk in execution of the project.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I guess my first question is related to the -- your ability to operate in the Permian. And the reason I say
that is the competing bidder has talked about their ability to create the most return enhancement and
their superiority as an operator. So Mike, can you address where you think you benchmark relative to
competition in terms of Permian development right now?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I mentioned earlier that we benchmark a wide range of metrics, and you really need to look at
performance in its -- in all the dimensions. And there are ways that we've seen in the past, Permian
operators that will optimize certain metrics, particularly things like early production. We don't -- we're
very careful about choke management, to deliver the best ultimate recovery. But there are other operators
that run with their chokes wide open and can show very strong early production numbers. You look at it
a year out, and there's quite a different picture that you see. So I think, number one, I would say you
have to be very careful about which metrics you look at. And we're focused on value creation and returns.
Short-term production is not the goal, and we're really looking at driving ultimately long-term recoveries,
a capital-efficient model that generates leading EURs, low cost per barrel and high returns. And you take
that and you put it together with an advantaged royalty position, and we can deliver value that is difficult
for anyone else to match. And over time, a company like ours has a technology capacity that few others
have, and we can add even more value as we drive cost down further as we improve recoveries and we
see technology do what it always does, which is unlock greater degrees of performance. And so I will
simply say that we look at our metrics and performance through a value lens, not a production lens.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
Appreciate that, Mike. My follow-up question is at the time you announced the transaction, you did raise
the target on annual buybacks to $5 billion from what it had been before. Now I appreciate the run rates
right now are affected by the transaction being in the public domain. But was the $5 billion -- was the
increase to $5 billion contingent upon the deal completing? Or is that a run rate you would expect to have
regardless?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
It was an announcement we made to indicate our strong confidence in the cash flow accretion and value
creation that this transaction enables. And so it is tied to the transaction. And as I said, we've got a strong
case. Pre-existing the transaction, we had increased from a run rate of $3 billion last year to a run rate of
$4 billion this year. And so the step up to $5 billion was a signal that this deal makes us even stronger.

Yes. And if I can just clarify on -- again, the first quarter buybacks were lower, Jason, as you said. We had
to stop buying back shares. We thought that was prudent when we believed we could be -- we could find
ourselves in possession of material nonpublic information related to the transaction. So we expect these
restrictions to continue in the second quarter. Circumstances could change, and we could be able to buy
back shares from time to time. But right now, expect low to no buybacks in the second quarter. And then
again, post-closing, we intend to increase the rate to the $5 billion annual or $1.25 billion per quarter.

Our next question comes from the line of Biraj Borkhataria from RBC Capital Markets.
Biraj Borkhataria
RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division
I just had one on your exploration strategy and this also relates to Anadarko. But we talk a lot about the
Permian in terms of synergies, but it seems like there's also quite a lot of an upside to exploration in the
GoM if you combine the 2 portfolios and follow a infrastructure-led exploration strategy. Could you just talk
a little bit about that and how you're thinking about that on the basis that this transaction does close? And
then the second question is there was a couple of articles earlier in the year around you transferring your
Permian royalty interest into a new subsidiary. I was wondering if there's anything to that, or if that's just
a non-news.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Yes, so the first one, exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. We've talked earlier about the fact that we
would see exploration synergies as we bring the 2 companies together and our exploration portfolios, and
we've talked about the fact that we would have a very powerful infrastructure position in the deepwater.
When you combine that with extended reach tiebacks, which we're in the final phases of technical
qualifications to significantly extend the length of tiebacks that we can do, we can cover a lot of the Gulf of
Mexico without necessarily needing new surface infrastructure. And this allows us to begin to explore for
accumulations that might not be economic on a stand-alone basis to support a new greenfield project, but
that could be developed through drilling and tieback into existing infrastructures platforms as ullage opens
up. And so it really enables a very different approach to exploration, and I think a much higher-return,
shorter-cycle, lower-risk way to look at the next phase of development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Not to say we might not have some greenfield projects, because certainly, there could be circumstances
where that becomes the right economic outcome. I'd also point out that we're an equity holder in a
discovery that was just announced this week, the Blacktip discovery, which Shell is the operator on,
encountered over 400 feet of net pay. It's about 30 miles away from Perdido and Whale, so we continue
to see discoveries and we've got great strengths in an area that has tremendous resource opportunity,
and the challenge is to find ways to deliver it and generate better returns out of that. Your question on
the Permian royalty, what we've done is consolidated all of our royalty into an entity, which allows us to
manage that royalty with focus and efficiency, and ensure that as activity in the Permian continues to grow
and we have a strong royalty position, that, that royalty is properly accounted for, collected and managed.
It certainly opens up options to do things that you've seen others do. I don't want to indicate that we
would or would not do that, but it certainly positions us with an entity that could enable those kinds of
alternatives if at some point we saw that as one that was desirable.

Congrats, Pierre, again on the new role. So the first question I had was actually on the oil macro. Two
months away from the OPEC meeting, prices have clearly been very firm here off bottom in 2019. Mike,
just wanted your perspective on some of the moving pieces as it relates to oil macro. Has your view that
we're in an age of abundance fundamentally changed as you've had a more conservative worldview? Or do

you think price has been artificially lifted by OPEC cuts? And how do you think about OPEC behavior from
here? Not asking you to forecast the price, but your unique position to comment, given the fact that you
play across the value chain and you operate in some of these countries.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So let me give you my best shot on that one today, Neil. Global demand continues to be strong. We're
seeing demand go up by over 1 million barrels per day again this year. We had a very strong GDP number
for the first quarter in the U.S., I think surprisingly strong that has come out today. And we've consistently
said that we don't see evidence of weakening around the world. We're across the value chain in many
different products in many different geographies. So economic growth looks solid, and oil demand growth
continues to march upward. At the end of last year, as we saw some weakness, there were concerns
about trade in China and economic activity, and those have somewhat receded. On the supply side, you've
got the usual set of dynamics underway, right. We've got geopolitical issues with the Iran waivers not
being extended, which creates the prospect of some tightness. Venezuela continues to be very difficult.
Libya is in and out of the news, and so you have some of the same things that create concerns and real
tightness, in some cases, on the supply side. And then you have OPEC plus the non-OPEC countries,
which for the last couple of years, maybe 3 years or so, have demonstrated the resolve to manage their
supply in a way that's consistent with more stable markets. You throw on top of that commentary from
the President, which again today, I guess he's out with comments about OPEC. And I think you still have
OPEC in a place where they do play a role in creating a forward expectation on the supply side. And so in
some ways, the dynamics, while the specifics of which countries might have supply issues and how the
global demand picture shapes up, it's a story of forward expectations on supply and demand and then the
geopolitical overlay that can change that. Fundamentally, we still believe that the world needs more of all
types of energy, and so we're in favor of renewable energy. We're in favor of conventional energy and the
economics, markets and technologies sorting out what the best mix is in each country around the world.
There is no shortage of resource to be developed, and so costs matter and we continue to drive to be very
competitive from a cost of supply standpoint. So I'm not sure I gave anything really brand-new there, but
that's how I see it.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
No, that's helpful. Just the follow-up from our side is if we were to take the Anadarko transaction out of
the equation, one of the concerns some investors have expressed over the course of the year has been
does Chevron have the portfolio that -- to thrive in 2023 to 2028? And you kind of gave us some flavor of
what that looks like at the Analyst Day. Post the Permian ramp and post Tengiz, what's that next wedge
of growth? And it sort of -- it begs the question, was the Anadarko potential transaction an offensive
transaction or a defensive transaction? So I just wanted to give you an opportunity to respond to that
because I think your view here is that you do have a stand-alone opportunity set independent of that
transaction, but it's certainly something that's been brought up by investors.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, absolutely. I mean I said it in March and I'll say it again, we do not have resource anxiety. We've
been replacing reserves. We've got nearly 70 billion barrels of resource. We've given transparency on the
production outcome for 5 years because people have wanted to see a longer view on that. And so you see
there's 3% to 4% growth now steadily being delivered over 5 years, which has been difficult for companies
to do consistently over an extended period of time at the scale that our company operates. We're very
confident that we can do that. And we stopped at 5 years just as a matter of convention, not because
we think there's a problem after that. And so unconventionals don't flatten out after that. Our Permian
position has got decades of resource, not a few years. We tried to highlight our other shale and tight
resource positions, which are in the very early stages of development and continue to have very strong
performance metrics and economics that are converging on Permian level economics, which is really the
goal that we've put in front of them. I've already talked on the call a little bit about deepwater, where
we've got Anchor more -- Anchor Ballymore, Whale, Blacktip now. We've got the ability to bring tiebacks

into a larger system or into the existing system. Your question is ex the Anadarko transaction. We've got
acreage in Brazil, in Mexico, in West Africa. So there are positions around the world. We've got -- we're
still operating in Venezuela where there's an enormous amount of resource. And one day, that will begin to
be developed again. We've got production offline in the Partitioned Zone. I'll stop there, but I'll simply say
that the opportunities for us to invest in and develop a resource that we hold today extends well beyond
2023, and it's a function of which projects compete the best for capital investment. A lot of short-cycle
stuff in there that is pretty low risk, and then there's some longer-cycle things that are larger, and I think
you'll see a blend of those deliver strong economic outcomes, which is what drives our decisions, not
production targets. But I think the cupboard is -- the cupboard is full, not empty.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons Energy.
Blake Michael Fernandez
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Pierre, I'm sorry to flog the buybacks, but I just want to make sure I'm 100% clear on this. Is it fair to
say 2Q buybacks should essentially be 0? And assuming that is the case, even when you ramp up to $1.25
billion per quarter, obviously, on a full year basis, we're going to come in below that $4 billion number due
to the Anadarko deal? Is that the correct way to look at it?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes, essentially. And let me just restate it. So yes, the $4 billion guidance was -- did not anticipate a
transaction or an acquisition at the time. There are 2 sort of restrictions that we're operating under. One
is when we're in possession of material nonpublic information, we're not allowed to buy back shares.
Even if and when that clears itself up, there are other restrictions on buybacks when there's a business
combination happening and equity's being issued. So you can't buy back during the proxy solicitation,
other limitations on buybacks versus historical rates. So we're just operating under a different regime here
during the transaction. Post-closing, absolutely, we have talked about the gross debt ratio being below
20%, lots of capacity to increase it. So there could be some buybacks, but again, the guidance is low or
no buybacks in the second quarter. And then when we get post-closing, we'll be able to give -- achieve the
guidance and won't be encumbered by restrictions tied to the acquisition.
Blake Michael Fernandez
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Very clear. The second question is really on the Permian and more on the gas side. I know you've worked
a lot to get firm takeaway capacity on the crude side. Waha pricing has been really weak. Can you talk
about, I guess, what alleviation avenues you have on that side as far as takeaway or improving your price
realizations as you continue to grow there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'll take that, Blake, and then Pierre might have some perspective as well. We've got takeaway
capacity for all our production. And so whether it's oil, NGLs or gas, we're moving it and taking it to
market. We are not engaged in routine flaring and would not intend to flare gas to enable production.
And we have shed in a little bit of dry gas. So if you don't have liquids right now, sometimes, it's better
to just keep that gas in the ground for a better market. Our current production in the Permian is 75%
liquids and 25% gas. We're focusing on liquid-rich benches. And as we've described and you alluded to,
we've been looking at takeaway capacity several quarters ahead of our production the entire time here.
And so I think what you're seeing in the market is something that you should expect to see for a number
of years in the future, which is we've got a lot of people out there that are developing resource. Got a lot
of people investing in midstream infrastructure. And there are going to be times when those all sync up
and you see pretty normal transportation-type differentials. And you'll see other periods of time where
the market may anticipate some tightness, and you'll see the differentials widen out. I know Waha's been

pretty ugly here lately. Kinder Morgan's got some pipes that come online this year and next year, which
probably start to change that equation. The Mexico market has been a little slower to come than people
expected. And we've got some Waha exposure in our portfolio, but it's not anything that is material in the
scope of our company. And I think we're, like I said, we're well positioned on takeaway capacity across all
the commodities to support our production into the future.
Operator
Our next question comes the line of Jon Rigby from UBS.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
It's around the CapEx side and the capital side of the transaction, actually. The first is something I don't
think has got enough attention is the high-grading process that will -- that you intend to indulge in after
the deal closes. And I just wanted to explore that because as we think about -- as we start to look at the
future combination, we need to think about what it is you might be doing around that. So I just wanted
to confirm whether you see that as part of the sort of value proposition, there's actually a value to be
delivered through that disposal process, and the sort of portfolio management that you can do. Secondly
is whether that process is already underway. And thirdly, whether you can maybe lift the curtain a little
and give us some idea about not necessarily the assets, but the kind of thoughts that you have around the
type of portfolio you'd like to emerge with and the things that you will be -- the criteria which you will be
using. And then the second question, if I'll just add it because somewhat linked, is the $1 billion of CapEx
efficiencies that you identified as part of the transaction, can you just confirm that those are about doing
the same thing for less rather than just ramping down activity so we just compare like-for-like?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay. Well, there's a lot in there, Jon. That was well done. So let me start with the portfolio and try
to frame that up for you, and then I'll come to the capital. You asked about the process. We've got an
ongoing process where we look at high grading our portfolio. We've had $2 billion to $3 billion in asset
sales kind of on average over a long period of time. We're continuing -- always looking to high-grade the
portfolio from a strategic alignment standpoint, the ability to compete for capital, what the assets are that
will allow us to compete and deliver strong returns into the future. And oftentimes, those may not be the
same ones that satisfied that criteria in the past. As I was out last week, I mentioned to people, if you go
back about 15 years and you think about our upstream portfolio, Tengiz was our real flagship asset. It was
in the process of an expansion with SGI/SGP that took 100% production from 350- to 650-or-something-
thousand barrels a day. Our share of that was half. So we were on the way to the asset that we have
today. And the Permian was kind of out of sight, out of mind for most people. Our Australian LNG projects
have not been sanctioned. None of our LNG products have been sanctioned. And we were just beginning
to move off the shelf into the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. If you think about it today, in Australia, we're
producing 400,000 barrels of equivalent and nice cash margins. Tengiz is on its way to 1 million barrels
a day on 100% basis. Our share, half of that, so 500,000 a day. The Permian we outlined is on its way to
900,000 barrels a day, our share, and that doesn't stop when you get to that number. The deepwater is,
with the combination of 2 companies, is pushing close to 400,000 a day. So we now have 4 positions that
have scale, that have resource depth and length, that have strong economics, that have lots of running
room. And we have the ability to drive costs down and returns up through the way we manage and invest
in those resources over time. So it's a very different portfolio than when we would have had just 1 smaller
asset and a lot of other ones then that were required to have the scale to compete. So we need to take
a look at the rest of our portfolio and determine those assets that really can still compete for capital and
offer the low-cost, high-return characteristics, the resource length, and we'll compete for capital over
time. I hope you're still with us, Jon. It sounds like you might be evacuating.
Jonathon Rigby
UBS Investment Bank, Research Division
Yes, sorry. No, it's classic timing of the annual -- sort of the weekly test. Apologies for that.

All right. I'll be quick so you can comply. So we got a different portfolio, and we will look to make some
decisions on those assets that really will compete for capital that offer the resource potential and the value
for our shareholders over time, what those are, we'll disclose as we get into transactions. The capital
that we've indicated, you should think of it as both reductions and spend between the 2 companies and
efficiency in that spend. So we'll look at contracts and the ability to execute and drive capital efficiency
into the system and also drive overall spend down, while at the same time, investing more in the Permian,
which is what we indicated our intention is to do. So we'll squeeze capital out of the combined system.
We'll squeeze efficiency into the combined system. And we will find ways to accelerate activity in the
Permian, which will bring value forward.

Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Hopefully you can hear me, and I don't believe there are any problems in the background right now.
I guess, Mike, kind of unusual situation here in terms of the bidding and typically, you put your teams
together, you expect them to be very focused going forward. I was wondering, in an environment like this,
do you end up having to divert people's attention to dealing with what may be an ongoing process here
in terms of the Anadarko bid? And then how do you think about managing your way through that, kind
of keeping everybody doing the things they need to do, plus the team that's focused here on the merger
integration and all that stuff.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Look, I mentioned that we've put together joint integration teams already and that they met this week.
And this isn't just a small group of people, this was a sizable group of people that spent multiple days
together. And we've got a playbook for doing this. We did Unocal a decade ago, Texaco a few years before
that. We have some of the same people involved that led those integrations. And so people have their eye
on the ball and are focused on moving forward with things. And so I'll just remind everyone, we've got a
signed deal that's been approved by both boards, and we're moving forward with integration planning so
we can deliver value.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Okay. Well, good luck on that. Maybe to flip back and actually think about the operations here. In the
quarter, we saw a little lighter on the gas side globally, stronger on the crude side. Just curious how
much of that is -- we had some unplanned downtime, I believe, in Australia with the LNG. As you look
going forward, this kind of global mix between oil and gas and taking into account maybe some dry gas
remaining shut into the Permian for a while.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I mean I do think what you saw was primarily some downtime at one of the trains in Australia at
Gorgon. And because that's a bigger part of our portfolio now, we've got the train down for some work.
You'll see that. The dry gas isn't a big number, and so I wouldn't worry about that so much. There was

also some weather in Australia that create an impact. There was a cyclone that came through, and we had
to take some slowdowns at both Wheatstone and Gorgon as we rode through that. So but those are really
the things that are hitting the gas production.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
Just real quick, if I could follow-up on that. Is there any planned downtime between Gorgon and
Wheatstone we should consider in the rest of the year?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, we're moving into normal turnaround mode now for both of those. The plan at Gorgon would be to
only have one train down in any given year. And so our plan right now would be to execute Train 1 at
Gorgon later this year. The upstream, in aggregate, from a turnaround standpoint, the turnaround season
begins really in the second quarter. You can think about the third quarter as probably the heaviest quarter
because we'll have one of the KTL lines at TCO and turn around there. And then as we go third into fourth
quarter, you'll see 1 train at Gorgon down for a turnaround. But it's -- we're into the normal operations
and turnaround cycle with the LNG plants.

And Roger, this is Pierre. I mean, we generally will provide guidance if there's heavy upstream turnaround
activity in the earnings call.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Mike, as you know, we're big fans of what you guys have done here, but I want to ask a little bit of a
sensitive question, if I may. There's been some speculation, I guess some fact-checking in the press
that given that Anadarko already had a bid in hand from Oxy for their letter, they then went ahead and
increased their change of control for their senior management. I wonder if you could speak to your opinion
on that and how -- what perspective you would offer in terms of perhaps the history of your discussions
that maybe led to that point. Obviously, it's a little bit sensitive, but it's something that some shareholders
are raising some concern about.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Doug, there are numerous aspects of our negotiation and the deal that will be explained in the S-4
filing. It's premature and inappropriate for me to comment on any of the aspects of how this all came
together. I'd encourage you just to read the S-4 when it's filed.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Okay. I know it was going to be a tough one to answer, so I appreciate you trying. My more specific
question to Chevron is, obviously, post deal, there's going to be a very significant tailwind from synergies
and all the things that you've laid out. One assumes that if you did match the higher bid, does that change
anything by way of your buyback plans, dividend growth trajectory, any of those kind of issues? And what
I'm really getting at is that if for some reason, you did hit a high bar where you did not decide to move
forward in that event, I realize it's unlikely, but the bulk of your future growth through to 2023 is largely
-- it looks like a lot of it is coming from Permian gas. So I'm just curious how absent this deal, would you

be able to sustain the buybacks and commit to a strong growth trajectory for dividends? And I'll leave it
there.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I'm not going to speculate on what Anadarko's Board may do and how that plays out. I'll just tell you
that in our base case, we produce 75% liquids in the Permian, so it's not primarily gas. We've indicated
that we expect to see our industry-leading cash margins sustained as the production grows, and that
we've initiated a buyback program that we intend to stick with through any reasonable commodity price
environment. And so there are not risks to be cashed that would support shareholder distributions here in
the vein of what you're talking about. So we're very confident in the plan we've laid out and our ability to
deliver.

Wolfe Research, LLC
Shouldn't be muted. Okay. Sorry about that. I just have a quick question. We've been through a lot on the
Anadarko topic already. I've got a question for Pierre, a follow-up to the TCO topic earlier. If TCO keeps
taking up the co-lending program, theoretically it's to preserve dividends. But if that's happening at the
same time that commodity prices are broadly higher than what was planned for, does that flow into the
Chevron capital program as sort of like a net cash surprise? Or is the authorization part of your sort of free
cash flow outlook and it's not dynamic what TCO decides to do? And then just as a follow-up, like if it's
the former, does Chevron then have headroom to rotate cash at the Chevron level into other things like
Permian, incremental Permian, for example?
Pierre R. Breber
VP & CFO
Yes. Thanks, Sam. No, the financing doesn't impact capital, how we characterize capital. So the capital
is going to be what is invested in the project. Again, that's affiliate capital, so noncash capital. What can
vary is -- where I thought you were going is if prices are higher, then there's clearly more cash generation
within TCO, and therefore, their ability to balance making investment and paying dividends is easier
and might pull less on the loans. So again, we're giving guidance on the financing, but it is subject to
prices, level of investments that are happening and the level of dividends. All of those are in interplay.
But if prices stay higher longer, then that gives them more flexibility to either decrease the lending or the
borrowings or increase the dividends, which in either case, that's more cash to the company. It shows up
in different parts of the cash flow statement, but in neither case does that affect CapEx.

Okay. Yes, that's why I was asking, because it sounded like there was a potential outcome where TCO is
self-funding and inclusive of the dividend, but they still uptake the co-lending, in which case, you've got
like surplus cash, but I guess it's not. It wouldn't affect anything else, so okay. All right.

I'm not going to ask about the Anadarko deal because it seems like it's been covered on the call. I want
to actually ask about what's going on in California right now just given you guys are -- have a pretty big
footprint in the state. Commerce is in the process of reviewing a bill to kind of institute a change in how
oil production goes on there, kind of the setback rules similar to what Colorado tried to put forth. I'm
wondering what you see as potential risks, if any, to your portfolio in the state both on the refining side
and the production side relative to that regulation.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Okay, Jason. Yes, so California has pretty aggressive ideas on regulating our industry. And what you
referred to is AB-345, which is in the assembly right now. Wouldn't impact downstream at all. It's really
-- you can think of it as analogous to what has been going on in Colorado. And the primary concern is
setbacks for activity. Our portfolio in California is primarily in the San Joaquin Valley, and it tends to be
an area where it's not populated the same way the L.A. Basin is, which is where historically, there was a
lot of -- the roots of our company and a lot of the industry trace their way back into the L.A. Basin. And
so there, you've got a much more densely populated urban and suburban land use matrix and concerns
about the proximity of drilling activities to residential, schools, commercial, et cetera, is really I think
what's behind this. So we are working closely with the state government to ensure they understand the
impacts. Others in the industry and trade associations are as well. And so it's prospective legislation that's
being considered here. It really impacts permitting for new wells. It doesn't impact things that are already
on production. We've got a big producing business that's online today. And then I think our portfolio is in a
part of the state that would likely be less impacted than if our production were more heavily concentrated
into the L.A. basin.
Okay. Thank you very much. Jason, I think we are right about at the top of the hour here. And I know
everybody's busy on a Friday, so I want to thank everyone for your time today. Appreciate your interest in
Chevron and your participation on the call today. Jonathan, back over to you.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Presentation
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jonathan, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Welcome to Chevron's
Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call
is being recorded.
I will now turn the conference call over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Chevron
Corporation, Mr. Mike Wirth. Please go ahead.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thank you, Jonathan. Welcome to Chevron's fourth quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On
the call with me today are Pat Yarrington, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Wayne Borduin,
General Manager of Investor Relations.
We'll refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website. Before we get started, please be reminded
that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. Please review
the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
Back in March, I laid out Chevron's strategy to win in any environment. I outlined our 3 compelling
strengths: an advantaged portfolio, sustainability at lower prices and a strong balance sheet. I also
indicated that the combination of these distinct advantages, together with the commitments to action,
highlighted in blue, would deliver growing free cash flow and shareholder returns.
In 2018, we delivered. We grew oil and gas production by more than 7%, achieving our highest
ever annual production. We grew cash margins in our operated upstream assets, contributing to an
improvement in cash returns. We lowered our unit costs, and we sold $2 billion of assets. These outcomes
yielded record free cash flow, a dividend increase and the initiation of a share repurchase program. 2018
was a very successful year, and we intend to build on this momentum in 2019.
Turning to Slide 4, a view of our sources and uses of cash. Excluding working capital, we generated over
$31 billion in cash flow from operations. We achieved record free cash flow of nearly $17 billion, the
highest level ever achieved by Chevron in any price environment. This allowed us to deliver on all 4 of our
financial priorities.
For the 31st consecutive year, we maintained our commitment to dividend growth and paid out $8.5 billion
in cash dividends to our shareholders. Earlier this week, we announced a $0.07 per share increase in our
quarterly dividend to $1.19 per share, representing a 6% increase.
Second, we allocated capital across a diverse portfolio and funded our highest-return projects. We have
confidence these investments position us for sustainable growth and free cash flow.
Third, we strengthened our balance sheet and paid down debt by $ 4.5 billion. Finally we began
repurchasing shares in the third quarter and increased the rate in the fourth quarter, demonstrating
further confidence in our future cash generation. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pat, who will take
you through the financial results. Pat?
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
Okay. Thanks, Mike. Turning to Slide 5, an overview of our financial performance. Fourth quarter earnings
were $3.7 billion or $1.95 per diluted share. 2018 full year earnings were $14.8 billion or $7.74 per diluted
share, up more than 60% from 2017. In the quarter, foreign exchange gains of $268 million were offset by
a special item related to a project write-off. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange
is included in the appendix to this presentation.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
For the full year, earnings excluding special items and foreign exchange, totaled $15.5 billion. Return
on capital employed for 2018 was 8.2%, up from 5% in 2017. Our debt ratio at year-end was 18% and
our net debt ratio was approximately 14%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2.1 billion in dividends,
bringing the full year total to $8.5 billion. And we increased the rate of our share repurchases from $750
million in the third quarter to $1 billion in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. For the full year, cash flow from operations totaled $30.6 billion, about 50% higher
than 2017. Headwinds, as we've defined them in the past, totaled $3.2 billion for the year, in line with my
original guidance.
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $9.2 billion. It was lower than in the third quarter, primarily
because of lower commodity prices, but it was well above first quarter, when prices were comparable. This
improvement within the year was due to the growth in production.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4 billion and $13.8 billion for the year. The resulting free
cash flow of almost $17 billion reduced our dividend breakeven price. We are covering our cash CapEx and
dividend at just under $53 Brent without consideration of asset sale proceeds.
Before moving off cash flow, a little guidance for 2019. If prices hold at current levels, we expect
headwinds for 2019 to be between $2 billion and $3 billion.
Now on to Slide 7. Full year 2018 earnings of $14.8 billion were approximately $5.6 billion higher than
2017. Special items, primarily the absence of a U.S. tax reform gain of $2 billion, lower gains on asset
sales and an increase in charges relating to project write-offs, resulted in a net $3.9 billion decrease in
earnings. A swing in foreign exchange impacts benefited earnings between the periods by $1.1 billion.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased by about $9.3 billion between
periods, primarily because of higher realizations and increased lifting. Slightly offsetting were higher
operating expenses largely associated with continued ramp-up in production along with additional taxes
and other costs.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by just over $90 million.
Lower volumes reflected the sales of our Canadian and South African refining and marketing assets, while
higher operating expenses were associated with planned turnaround activity in the U.S. These items are
mostly offset by favorable timing effects and improved results at CPChem.
In the Other segment, excluding special items and foreign exchange, net charges for the period increased
by almost $750 million, due primarily to higher interest expense and lower tax deductibility for corporate
charges. Full year net charges were $2.3 billion, in line with our guidance.
Our 2019 guidance for the Other segment remains about $2.4 billion in net charges. As a reminder,
though, quarterly results in this segment are nonratable.
Now on Slide 8. 2018 production was 2.93 million barrels a day, an increase of 202,000 barrels a day or
more than 7% from 2017. This is the highest level of production in the company's history.
Excluding the impact of 2018 asset sales, production grew approximately 8% or 1% above the top of the
guidance range we provided last January. Major capital projects increased production by 227,000 barrels a
day as we continue to ramp up production at multiple projects, most significantly Wheatstone and Gorgon.
Shale and tight production increased 132,000 barrels a day, primarily in the Permian, where production
grew by more than 70% from 2017.
Base declines, net of production from new well, mostly in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Nigeria, were 19,000
barrels a day. The impact of asset sales, in particular from the U.S. Mid-Continent, Gulf of Mexico shelf
and the Elk Hills Field in California reduced production by 50,000 barrels per day. Entitlement effects
in total reduced production by 46,000 barrels per day, 17,000 of which was due to the effect of higher
prices during the year. Higher planned turnaround effects, primarily at Angola LNG and Tengiz, reduced
production between years by 26,000 barrels per day.
I'll now hand it back to Mike.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 9, reserve replacement continues to be a real success story. In 2018, our
reserve replacement ratio was 136%. We added almost 400 million more barrels than we produced and
divested. This outcome is especially significant because it was achieved while growing production more
than 7%.
Our reserved/production ratio stands at a healthy 11.3 years, showing the strength and sustainability of
our portfolio. Our 5-year reserve replacement ratio of 117% further illustrates that strength through the
price downturn.
Moving to Slide 10. We continue to maintain our commitment to capital discipline. Total C&E in 2018 was
$20.1 billion. This included approximately $600 million of inorganic spend for which we don't budget,
primarily related to bonus payments for offshore leases in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico.
The stacked bar depicts our organic C&E budget for 2019 of $20 billion. Within this budget, the cash
component is $13.7 billion while the remaining $6.3 billion is expenditures by affiliates, primarily TCO and
CPChem.
In the 2019 budget, $3.6 billion is allocated to the Permian and another $1.6 billion is allocated to other
shale and tight assets. We expect approximately 70% of our total 2019 spend to deliver cash within 2
years. Our current spend profile has significantly lower execution risk relative to the past when we had
several large-scale major capital projects underway concurrently.
Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to provide an update on our portfolio optimization efforts. During 2018, we
received before tax asset sale proceeds of $2 billion, with the largest contributors being the divestment of
our Southern African refining and marketing business and our interests in the Elk Hills Field in California.
We recently completed the sale of our interest in the Rosebank Project, West of Shetlands in the U.K.
In addition, we expect to close the sale of our interest in the Danish Underground Consortium in the first
half of 2019. And earlier this week, we executed an agreement to sell our interest in the Frade field in
Brazil. We continue marketing our U.K. Central North Sea and Azerbaijan assets. As with all divestments,
we're focused on generating good value from any transaction.
The progress we made last year is consistent with our guidance of $5 billion to $10 billion in asset sale
proceeds from 2018 to 2020.
Turning to the Permian. Production in the fourth quarter was 377,000 barrels per day, up 172,000 barrels
per day or 84% relative to the same quarter last year. Annual production was up more than 70%. In the
Permian, we remain focused on returns. We are not chasing our production target nor are we altering
our plans based on the price of the day. Over the last 2 years, we transacted more than 150,000 acres
through swaps, joint ventures, farm-outs and sales, further optimizing our large land position.
In 2018, we had takeaway capacity for oil and liquids that was more than sufficient, and we've already
added more capacity this year. We are pleased with our position and leading performance in the Permian.
In just 2 years, we've doubled our rig count, increased our resource base, decreased unit development
and operating costs and more than doubled our production. We'll provide new guidance for our Permian
portfolio in March.
Moving to LNG. The plants at Gorgon and Wheatstone performed well during the fourth quarter and
averaged almost 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was despite higher summer temperatures
in December. Higher temperatures, as you know, generally reduce LNG throughput. We loaded 329 LNG
cargoes from Gorgon and Wheatstone last year. We've now commissioned the Wheatstone domestic gas
plant and expect to provide gas to the local market in the next few weeks. We'll begin our routine cycle of
planned turnarounds at Gorgon this year. We'll be on a 4-year cycle, with 1 train undergoing maintenance
each of the first 3 years and the fourth year having no turnaround scheduled. We expect turnarounds at
the Gorgon trains to last about 40 days. These turnarounds offer the opportunities to perform routine

maintenance and also to make small enhancements that increase reliability and throughput. We anticipate
significant cash generation from these assets for many years to come.
Slide 14 shows our production outlook for this year, assuming a $60 Brent price. We expect production to
be 4% to 7% higher than last year, excluding the impact of any 2019 asset sales. Our growth is largely
driven by shale and tight assets and full year production from Train 2 at Wheatstone. These forecasts
always need to acknowledge the uncertainties in our business, as noted on the slide. In summary, we
anticipate a third consecutive year of strong production growth.
Moving to Slide 15, as announced earlier this week, we've signed an agreement with Petrobras America
Inc. to purchase its 110,000 barrel-per-day refinery and related assets in Pasadena, Texas. This addition
to our Gulf Coast refining system allows us to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of
our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron-produced products; and realize regional synergies
through coordination with our refinery in Pascagoula. We expect to close by midyear, and we'll provide
further updates at our analyst meeting in March.
Now just a few comments about future expectations. We expect positive production trends to continue in
the first quarter and throughout 2019, reflected in the 4% to 7% growth forecast. And as early as first
quarter, we expect additional coal lending to TCO in support of the Future Growth Project.
In downstream, we expect low refinery turnaround activity in the first quarter, which as you recall from
our previous disclosure, equates to an estimated after-tax earnings impact of less than $100 million.
Earlier in the call, Pat provided you guidance on cash flow headwinds and corporate charges for 2019. And
as we communicated earlier this week, there will be a $0.07 per share quarterly dividend increase and we
anticipate $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 17, I'd like to share a few closing thoughts. As I mentioned before, we intend to win
in any environment. As a result of our advantaged portfolio, capital discipline, lower execution risk,
strong balance sheet and record-level free cash flow, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong
shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take your questions.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019","Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Gresh from JPMorgan.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
First question, you talked about the dividend breakeven of $53 in 2018. You stepped up the dividend here
at a higher rate than last year, and you're also stepping up the buybacks. So I guess, maybe if you can
just elaborate a little bit on this -- on the breakeven, where you see that going. Is it moving lower and
giving you more confidence in the -- more return on capital? Or just how you think about that calculus?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Phil, we worked really hard over the last few years to get that breakeven down. We were in the 80s
not that long ago and have made significant progress in bringing the dividend breakeven down. We've
provided, I think, kind of a simple way to think about it in some of our prior definitions. And as we look
forward in 2019, we think the dividend breakeven remains in the area where it was last year. You see
we've got really strong cash flows coming in right now. And the commitment to a competitive increase in
the dividend, the confidence to step up the rate of share repurchases is evidence of our confidence that
we've got those cash flows coming in, and in a price environment, any reasonable price environment, as
Pat has said, that we'll be able to sustain those kinds of payouts. The other thing I'll just point out is our
capital spending is still the same, and we've got the ability to provide strong production growth, sustain
the kind of cash of margins that you've seen out of our portfolio and do that at really modest capital
spending relative to our history.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Sure. Okay. The second question, I guess, will just be on that capital spending budget specifically for
2019. The Permian piece, pretty flattish year-over-year, which I think you highlighted last quarter. The
non-Permian shale piece is stepping up quite a bit here. And I just want to know if you could maybe
elaborate on that a little bit, not to steal any thunder from the Analyst Day, but is that something that
is going to be contributing to this 2019 production growth guidance? Or is that something that you're
ramping in '19 and it'll be more of a future contribution?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, we are beginning to ramp in the other basins. So we've added rigs, actually, in all the other shale
and tight basins in which we operate. We've seen significant reductions in development cost in the
Marcellus, in the Duvernay and in the Vaca Muerta as we've shared the learnings and improvements that
are emanating from the large-scale activity we have in the Permian. The economics on each of these
are compelling. The EURs are coming up. And while the Permian may be in the spotlight within our shale
and tight portfolio, it's far from the only asset that we have. The other thing that I'll just note is we've
begun an 8-well appraisal program in El Trapial, in the north of the Vaca Muerta. We're currently producing
in the Southern area, Loma Campana, but our folks are intrigued by the possibilities up in the North at
El Trapial, and we continue to prosecute that program. We've also picked up additional acreage in the
[indiscernible], 25,000 net acres we were nonoperated with YPF. And we've got a 4-well pilot that we plan
to execute there in 2019 as well. So great potential in Argentina. And we really like our entire shale and
tight portfolio. And again, it brings some of the characteristics we've been talking about, which is short
cycle time, attractive economics, low development costs and the ability to generate cash relatively rapidly.
The last thing I'll say about that is it brings a much lower risk profile than multiyear, multi-billion dollar
capital projects.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
Okay. And Pat, what was the amount of the coal lend there for TCO?
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
In 2018, the coal lend was 0.
Philip Mulkey Gresh
JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division
No, for the 1Q guide, I'm sorry.
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
Oh, the 1Q guide. Okay. So I don't have, I guess I would say, a confirmed number here for you because it
will depend on what happens to price. It will depend on what happens and how cash flow that's generated
from operations matches against the investment profile for the project. It will also depend on the dividend
distribution requirement for the partners. But I think order of magnitude, if you go back and you look
at 2016, when we first started the coal lending, that was about $2 billion. And I think as an order of
magnitude, starting off base, maybe think about $2 billion for this year. But as I said, we reserve the
right to change that number as the year progresses and we'd see what actually happens to prices and the
investment profile and as discussions are underway on dividends.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Paul Cheng from Barclays.
Paul Cheng
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
Mike, you talked about Argentina. I'm wondering, given the political environment and the infrastructure
or lack of infrastructure over there, how quickly do you think you can proceed with the development plan?
And any kind of timeline or the pace or the capital outlook that -- any kind of data that you can share?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
We'll probably talk about this a little bit more in March, Paul. But I'd just reiterate, YPF has been a very,
very good partner there. The Macri government is committed to improving the investment climate in
Argentina and has instituted a number of reforms to encourage and support energy development in the
country. We have great resource there that's benefiting from the Permian learnings and competitive
economics, multiple blocks that we've picked up. And much of the production can actually stay in the
country. So at this point, yes, the infrastructure is not developed the way that it is in the United States or
perhaps North America more broadly. But there's a commitment on the part of the government to do that.
And we'll pace our development with gas and liquids takeaway and market conditions. So the realities on
the ground in Argentina are a little bit different, but I've got to say, the resource is tremendous, and we
are very encouraged by the policy reforms that have been put forth by the government.
Paul Cheng
Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division
And for Pasadena, the refinery that you just bought, what's the game plan for that facility? I mean, are
you going to need to make a significant investment upfront to bring them to the Chevron standard?
Because that facility probably has been under-invested at least for 20, if not 30-plus years, and that the
labor relationship has been always very rocky. So what's the game plan? And how much is the upfront
investment? And extending it, are you going to run the asset full-blown facility or would that sort of be an
extension of Pascagoula?
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, okay. So let me try to respond to that, Paul, as best I can. We just executed an agreement this
week. We don't expect to close here until somewhat later here in the first half of the year. So it's a
little premature for me to lay out an investment plan until we actually close the transaction. In the due
diligence, we've satisfied ourselves that we can operate the facility safely and reliably at the standards
that we would expect, and so I don't think you should have any concerns there. It meets our kind of 3
primary criteria. One, we're getting it at a good price, and I believe one of the ways that you take risk out
of refinery acquisitions is you don't overpay. And I don't think that we're overpaying for the asset. It's in
a great location, and that allows us to integrate to increasing light crude production out of West Texas. It
allows us to serve our markets in Texas with a product that we run through our own system as opposed
to exchange or purchase product. And it will allow us to optimize and integrate with the Pascagoula
refinery. The third thing is it provides good strong economics. And because of our system and the 3 kind
of strategic levers that I just talked about, we ought to be able to optimize that refinery as a part of our
system in a way that is different than what the current owner can, simply because they don't have those
other assets and those other positions. And so within our business, this builds -- it builds a bit of a gap. It
gives us the ability to capture value in multiple different dimensions. And over time, we'll evaluate what
investments we may choose to make there as we would in any other refinery. I would expect those to be
relatively modest. I would expect them to be thoughtfully paced over time and to fit within the level of
spending that we've established over the past many years in our downstream business.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Neil Mehta from Goldman Sachs.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
The first question I had was around Tengiz and the latest on the project. Are you feeling good about the
timeline and thoughts on cost and the contingency as well?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Neil, so I probably don't have a lot to add to what we've previously said on this. We're still on
schedule. So we're still targeting a 2022 startup. As I think Jay mentioned on our third quarter call, on-
site productivity has improved. We had a very good summer. The logistics are working very well as we're
moving modules now from Korea to the staging points. We can't move through the inland waterway
system during the winter time because it freezes up. With modules arriving from Korea, from Italy and
from Kazakhstan, the quality levels are very high. We're about halfway through the project, about 50%
complete at this point. And 2019 will be a key year. There's a lot of activity in terms of moving modules
into the Caspian to the site, a lot of fieldwork. We will see if these productivity gains can be built upon
again in 2019. And it's certainly a year where we will reduce uncertainty. Jay is actually headed there this
weekend, and we'll be there next week and when we get to New York in March, he will have had recent
field visits to Kazakhstan and also to Korea. He was in Korea visiting the module fabrication yards last
week. And he'll be in a position to give you very good insight into exactly where we stand and what our
expectations are.
Neil Singhvi Mehta
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division
Yes, looking forward to that. And the follow-up. We just want to get some more color on the share
buyback, to follow up on Phil's question. I think most of us were expecting $750 million. It came in at $1
billion in the fourth quarter. As we think about the share buyback program, our view had been that this
program would be a kind of a baseload $3 billion program into perpetuity. But you're demonstrating that
you're willing to flex and lean into it. So can you talk about the philosophy behind that share repurchase
program? Is a higher run rate potential -- potentially sustainable? And how do you think about flexing it
from a big picture than a more granular perspective?

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I'm going to let Pat take that.
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
Okay. So Neil, thanks for the question. And I think the key word here is sustainability. And what you saw
with our increase was just our view of our future cash generation, the confidence that we have in our
future cash generation and a belief that we could move that rate of quarterly purchase up to $4 billion.
When we first initiated this back in the second quarter call, the points that I made were that we really
wanted to have this be through the cycle and sustainable through the cycle. And so that's really -- we paid
$3 billion because we thought that would be supportable through any reasonable price environment. We
obviously had stronger prices in 2018, and now they've come off a little bit. But we still feel very strong
about our cash generation in 2019 and, frankly, in the years to come. You will note -- maybe you won't
note, but we did release an 8-K this morning as well, that talks to the fact that our board has supported a
resolution for a $25 billion share repurchase program with no term limit. So I think that $25 billion gives
you an indication of the commitment that we have to this program, our view about the sustainability, and
yes, I think that should be a very strong message to our investors about our willingness and intent to
boost shareholders' distribution.

Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gammel from Jefferies.
Jason Gammel
Jefferies LLC, Research Division
I wanted to ask a question about the cost structure of the company. And the reason I ask is you've already
taken a lot of cost out of the upstream, but you seem to be with divestitures and some explorations
concentrating more and more into the highest-quality assets. And I'm just wondering if there's a potential
to take further overhead out of the business through medium-term shutting down regional offices, et
cetera. And this seems to be right out of the Mike Wirth downstream playbook of taking further cost out
and enhancing returns through concentration.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Well, Jason, I'll give you a short answer. The answer is yes. I think in a commodity business, you always
have to be looking for efficiencies. And I think scale matters. And we need to continue to look for ways
to control our own destiny, and a big part of that is moving into assets that have inherently lower cost
structures and continually seeking an efficient overhead structure to support that. I will tell you that
not only can we do that through what I would call conventional means in the way that it's always been
done, but technology today offers us the ability to do even more as we bring digital technologies into
our business and can do things. In a business that really grew up in an analog world, there's a lot of
opportunity to find more efficiencies. The other thing, when you're growing your business, it's important
to pay attention to unit costs. And we've seen unit cost come down significantly. We see this year another
2% reduction or so in unit cost. And as you look out to 2020 and 2021, I think that number can go up
even more in terms of the percent reduction, or the other way to say it is unit cost can come down even
more. So we need to be prepared to be competitive in an environment where prices are not what we look
to, and we'll continue to work on cost efficiencies across our entire portfolio.

Yes. So we've got the first well online, and it's been performing very well. It came on in November of last
year. The second well is being drilled and completed as we speak. And we anticipate that coming on here
in the first quarter. And so we'll steadily move through the process of adding wells at Big Foot, and you

Our next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey from Mizuho.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
You mentioned that you've got about 150,000 acres of swaps for sale, I believe, in the Permian, Mike. And
hi, Pat, by the way. Sorry, I slightly caught offguard there. I wanted just an update on where your final
numbers are for Permian acreage and how you feel about that given that there's some -- potentially some
fairly major assets available. I guess, you're strongly outperforming your volume targets. Can you also
talk about your returns there? Because there's concerns that you're perhaps not as leading edge as we
might want you to be in terms of your Permian performance on a returns basis.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we'll share a lot more detail in March because, as you can see, the performance out of the Permian
continues to be exceptionally strong. With the large land position that we have, we've got good currency
and optionality to try to improve that because everybody is interested in drilling longer laterals, finding
contiguous development areas. And so with our 2.2 million net acres and 1.7 million in the Midland and
Delaware basins, we've got lots of levers with which to optimize our position. And the nice thing about
these transactions is they are truly win-win because you can transact with other people. There's enough
economic value creation that you're not trying to split a finite pie but you're actually creating a bigger pie
for both. Our currently disclosed resource, there's 11.2 billion barrels. That's a figure we would expect to
grow. And so our confidence in the Permian is higher today than it was the last time that I spoke to you.
When you're talking about returns, these -- we've put out data before on the returns that we're seeing,
and they're well up in the 35%-plus range as we've moved to longer laterals, a better basis of design. And
even in a modest price environment, we're seeing very, very strong returns. It's as good as -- good or
better than anything else we could be doing. We are returns-driven, and I mentioned that in my prepared
remarks and I'll reiterate that. And it's returns across the life cycle of the assets and it's returns across the
entire value chain. And so we're not looking to put the most wells online or have the biggest IPs. We're
looking to get the best returns out of the system. We paused at 20 rigs. For several years, we've been
telling you we're going to grow to a 20-rig fleet. And as you go through that kind of growth, you stress
the system a little bit. And so we're pausing in terms of adding rigs at this point in order to ensure that
anything that needs to improve, from a performance standpoint, will. We engage in regular benchmarking
within the basin. We have a number of nonoperated joint ventures. We've got really good visibility into
what other operators are doing and what levels they're performing at. And I'll simply tell you that we are
continuing to improve performance in every dimension and intend to continue to and using benchmarking
to identify the areas where we can get better. So Jay will talk a lot more about this in March. We'll have a
breakout session that will give you a chance to go into detail with questions as well. But we feel like we're
delivering better performance. And across the value chain, I mentioned we've been well-situated with
takeaway capacity, and we've added capacity already in 2019. So we're able to capture margin across the
value chain. And later this year, that will include refining margin.
Paul Benedict Sankey
Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Research Division
And we know you've got an advantaged mineral right position there, which seems to be one of the issues
with any potential major deals that might occur in the Permian in the near future. But Mike, if I could ask
you another one. I was going to make some elaborate joke about you keeping it competitive by not having
just the CEO on the call but also the CFO. But I'm obviously referring to Exxon's CEO being on the call this

morning. There is a major -- the number of major differentiations between the 2 companies, and one of
them is your flat CapEx outlook. I think that you do well to maintain that. I think it is a relatively long-
term outlook as it stands. You just drifted towards the top of the range without going above it. What are
the prospects, have you actually seen falling CapEx and CapEx that surprised us to the downside going
forward given that your growth trajectory looks very good for a company of your size.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we're committed to capital discipline. We can grow our business at modest capital levels. And
we have -- we've got more good things to invest in than we will invest in. And last year, there are 2
notable examples. We relinquished our rights to the Tigris development projects in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico, not because it's not a good project, not because it can't generate a return, but we have better
opportunities within our portfolio. Same thing with Rosebank, a good project, a lot of resource, but one
that probably fits better for someone else than it does for us given our alternatives to invest. And so we
will continue to make those kinds of choices. The one thing that came up in the call earlier were the other
shale and tight opportunities, and those are really economic as well. And so there's opportunities for us
to, whether you're talking to the Permian or some of these other areas, over time to find highly attractive
opportunities to invest further capital, generate strong returns, minimize execution risk, short cycle. And
as our portfolio grows -- we were up 5% in production 2 years ago, 7% last year, we've just outlined
4% to 7% this year -- a growing portfolio over time does require modestly higher base capital spending
that would go with that. And so we're committed to capital discipline, and I think you've characterized
our ability to grow at relatively flat capital well. We'll update forward views beyond what we've already
articulated when we get to the March meetings. Thanks, Paul.

Our next question comes from the line of Blake Fernandez from Simmons.
Blake Michael Fernandez
Simmons & Company International, Research Division
Two questions for you. One, could you talk a little bit about Venezuela? I know it's early days, but
obviously, you do have exposure there both upstream and downstream. And just any helpful thoughts that
might help us out on our end.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, I can give you a quick update on Venezuela, Blake. First and most important thing for us is the safety
of our people on the ground. And so that's what we're really focused on. We also want to be sure the
operations where we have an interest are safe and environmentally sound. And I can tell you that, that
is the case. We've worked closely with the government to be sure that we understand the intent of the
sanctions. We've got a number of new general licenses issued by the Treasury department, and so we're in
close consultation to be sure we understand them and how they are to be applied. And I will say that the
U.S. government has been very interested in engaging with us to understand our position on the ground.
And we continue to operate, and I think for the foreseeable future, we feel like we can maintain a good
stable operation and a safe operation on the ground in Venezuela. If you look at it from the downstream
side in the U.S., Pascagoula is the one refinery of ours that tends to run Venezuelan crude, and it runs
kind of 70,000, 75,000 barrels, give or take. For some time, the prospects of actions like this have been
clear. And so we've had contingency plans in place. We've got alternate sourcing. We've got plenty of
crude in tank for Pascagoula. We've got crude on the water there. And so we're good here for the balance
of the first quarter and maybe a little bit beyond, and we've activated our contingency planning into a
full-scale execution right now. So we'll keep the refinery full with crude. We'll optimize. And I think we
feel like we're going to be able to navigate through this. Our biggest hope is for stability on the ground in
Venezuela and the safety of, not only our employees, but our contractors and the people in Venezuela.

Okay, I appreciate that. The second question, I know you've kind of covered Pasadena and we'll get some
additional color in March. But just more broadly speaking, I think you've kind of alluded to a potential
acquisition of a refinery on the Gulf Coast for some time. The size of this is 110,000 barrels a day or so,
which isn't small, but it's not really large in context of some of the Gulf Coast facilities. Does this satisfy
kind of your appetite or integration potential there? Or do you think there's additional scope to kind of
expand that over time?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
I don't want to speculate. We've got one transaction here that we've signed an agreement on. The key is
value and the ability for it to not only yield value on a stand-alone basis, but to integrate into our network
and be sure we can capture value out of that. So we're focused on that with the Pasadena refinery. And I
think I'll just -- I'll leave it at that.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Roger Read from Wells Fargo.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
I know all the really fun stuff has got to wait until March. But maybe to take a look at your CapEx mix.
You mentioned 70% as a 2-year or less weighting to cash flow whereas the rest, obviously longer. Do you
think, if we not so much look at a total CapEx number but the mix within that CapEx, does that start to
change back over the next couple of years? I'm thinking, number one, you signed a long-term deepwater
rig contract, obviously aimed at some of the more challenging parts of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. So
as things like that start to come in, do we see that start to move maybe to more of a 50-50 on CapEx? Or
is that something you want to maintain maybe more at the 70-30 levels, we think, over the next several
years?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, Roger, it's a good question because our mix has shifted very dramatically from where it was not long
ago. And it's come down by 50% from the high watermark and it's shifted in terms of its makeup, I think
both really important issues. And going back to Paul Sankey's question, I think that is the new normal
for us. We've got, in this year's budget, a little bit over $5 billion for shale and tight, $3.6 billion in the
Permian and $1.6 billion on other shale and tight. And over time, I think that number is likely to grow
rather than shrink. We've got FGP, which is in the peak spending years this year and next. And so that's
a nontrivial amount, a little bit over $4 billion in this year's budget. And so as that moves past the peak
and comes down, it creates room for other things, and that could include deepwater. It could include
more shale and tight or other major capital projects. On the deepwater, our intent would be to have a
ratable development program. And I think one of the things that we have learned over this past cycle,
I mentioned we had many large MCPs underway simultaneously, is that, that introduces execution risk
that is real. And so our intent would be to have a balanced approach as we go forward and not to find
ourselves so overly skewed to that kind of risk that it becomes an issue that's difficult to manage. And
because we've got the really strong shale and tight portfolio, I think that, plus our base business, which
again requires investment but is typically short cycle and quick to go from capital spend to cash in the
door, I think the kind of range that we're in today is more likely to, plus or minus, be the range you would
see in the future as opposed to something that flips back the other direction.
Roger David Read
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division
And then just to beat the Pasadena refining horse a little bit harder here. Part of the acquisition indicated
some undeveloped acreage. Are we wrong to think about this as just a refining acquisition and maybe you
should think about it more as an infrastructure opportunity across the board? I'm thinking we're moving
more and more towards crude exports from the U.S.

CHEVRON CORPORATION FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL | FEB 01, 2019
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
No, I think there's a reason we disclosed that because the asset there is not simply the refinery, but it's
the port access, it's the tankage and it's the land. And I've mentioned a couple of times that our goal is
to integrate this into our system. That means our upstream system, our downstream system, our trading
system. And when I was a young pup, one of the lessons I learned from a seasoned engineer in one of our
refineries is, he said, the cheapest process we have in this refinery is called a tank. And so there are times
when we can fall in love with building complex equipment, and there are realities that you can create
optionality in margin through infrastructure and in commercial activity at relatively low investment. And I
think this asset offers us the opportunity to not just participate in the refining margin, but also to look at
the other ways that, through our integrated system, we can capture value across the entire value chain,
both up and downstream. And that's the way we're approaching this.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Sam Margolin from Wolfe Research.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Mike, I'm going to try to not ask you to say the same thing again in a different way. But one of the
outcomes of the much [ passionately ] expected Permian growth is maybe that the free cash flow profile
of the Permian as a stand-alone entity has been pulled forward significantly. And maybe that's sort of an
obvious statement, or it's not new. But it seems like that's an important pendulum swing with respect to
how you might think about additional long-cycle projects. So among all these other factors that are sort of
-- that you've commented on kind of pointing you to thinking about expanding the portfolio in deepwater
or other long-cycle areas, is that something that's important, too? Or is that more something that's on
plan and you're just thinking about that within the buyback and the dividend growth and all your other
sort of uses of cash that are out there?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So I think the increased performance of the Permian is a good news story. We did spend a little
more capital last year because we're finding that we can drill more hole. We've changed our basis of
design. So a little bit of the capital overrun was related to the good news story that we're getting a lot
more production out of the Permian. And our guidance has been we're free cash flow positive in 2020.
And that's -- I think that's still a good way for you to think about it. As we reach the crossover point, it
crosses over. And we've increased the dividend. Pat's already addressed the confidence in increasing the
rate at which we're repurchasing shares and our intent to sustain that through the cycle. Having strong
free cash flow creates alternatives, and we intend to use the free cash flow to be very mindful of the
need for shareholder distributions and also, to look for good investment opportunities. I mentioned, we
were able to meet all 4 priorities this last year in terms of dividend, investment, balance sheet and share
repurchases, and our intent is to continue to respect that going forward. This kind of growth in free cash
flow allows us to do that.
Sam Jeffrey Margolin
Wolfe Research, LLC
Okay. And then just on a related note, I guess, this one's for Pat. Is there -- your leverage came down
a lot. Is there a target leverage to think about conceptually? Or is it just something that's going to be a
function of commodity prices in terms of the rate at which the balance sheet fluctuates here?
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
Right. Sam, we don't have a target leverage rate. We think of the balance sheet as being the outcome
of other previously outstanding decisions about how we've used the cash that we're generating. As I've

said in the past, maybe a 20% leverage ratio, on average, through the cycle. And that when you were
in a stronger price environment, you'd obviously build back your balance sheet some. And when you're
in a weaker price environment, you'd use it some. And so I think that's really what we're trying to --
that's kind of the sweet spot or the sweet area that we're trying to play in. Having a good balance sheet
is a good insurance policy. And having a good balance sheet allows us, for both dividends and share
repurchases, to sustain those through any period of price weakness. And we feel that, that's an important
component.

Alastair R Syme
Citigroup Inc, Research Division
Just really, just one on your view on the state of the Gulf Coast chemical polyethylene market and how
that makes you think about potential expansion plans.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes, we're still very positive on the petrochemical investments opportunity, and particularly here in the
United States. It's -- I think it's a good, long-term story. We've seen some pressure on margins here
recently. Feedstock costs in the third quarter were up. I think olefin chain margins have been under a
little bit of pressure. But these things happen in commodity markets with long cycle times for projects
and it kind of ebbs and flows in the economy. So that hasn't fundamentally changed our view on the
attractiveness of the sector.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Douglas George Blyth Leggate
BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division
Mike, we always appreciate you getting on these calls, so thanks again for doing it this time around. Mike,
my question might actually be for Pat. Pat, you talked about the $13 billion-plus of cash spending. Can
you give us an idea, as the affiliate spending rolls off with Tengiz completed, how do you anticipate that
cash CapEx to trend given that you're holding the line on the $18 billion to $20 billion absolute spending,
at least through 2020?
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
So I think Mike answered that question in a way, although he didn't split out cash versus total headline
C&E. But as you see TCO spending come off, and as we move towards first production there in 2022,
the other affiliate where we have potentially investment opportunities would be CPChem. And so that --
what occurs in that particular category will be a function of how decisions are made on final investments
of [indiscernible] for example. So it's not something that I can predict with any degree of certainty. I
think what's important is, that the summation of both, I would say, company-owned and operated and
affiliate-owned and operated, we're staying within that $18 billion to $20 billion C&E range for the near
term here, certainly. And we'll give you an update in March on a prospectively longer period of time. So I
think capital discipline is the theme that you want to read through all of this. And the fact is, that we have
the opportunity to be very judicious and very selective about how we work in additional projects into our
queue.

I know it's a tough one to answer, but given all the variables. My follow-up is kind of related, I guess.
But if we go back to '10, '11, '12 through '14, '15, obviously a lot of big oils, yourselves included, were
spending much higher levels than you are today. And one assumes that, that created a lot of cost recovery
barrels in some of the PSCs. So I guess my question is, to the extent you can, as you look forward in light
of Thailand, how do you see your entitlement barrels trending if you maintain that CapEx at these levels?
Do you start to see cost recovery barrels peel off? And if you can maybe offer some quantification of that,
I'd appreciate it.
Patricia E. Yarrington
VP & CFO
Doug, I don't think we've got numbers here that we can isolate for you on that. Cost recovery applies
across a number of locations in our portfolio here. You're obviously aware of what's happened in
Indonesia. So I don't think I have a pinpointed answer that I can give you on that.

Our next question comes from the line of Doug Terreson from Evercore ISI.
Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Mike, I have a question about portfolio optimization and specifically, the divestiture part of the plan.
And on this point, you guys have had a pretty active program over the years, but you still also have a
decent amount of value left in the queue. And so my question is, is this because the market for assets
has softened somewhat? Or do you consider it to be kind of normal course of business during the cycle?
Or is it something else? So any color on your divestiture program and the market trends you guys are
experiencing, is really the question.
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'm not 100% sure I'm tracking with you there, Doug. We've always had a program of divestitures,
and there are times it's a little high, there are times it's a little bit lower. But in this business, you're
continually looking to upgrade your portfolio. We've got some things now that are really attractive, and
I earlier mentioned a couple of things that we stepped away from because we didn't think they would
compete for capital. Divestments are driven by a view on strategic alignments with our broader portfolio
and our view of the future, the resource potential that remains in a particular asset. Will it compete for
capital within our portfolio? And there are good things, as I mentioned earlier, that cannot. And then, can
we receive fair value? So that may be a little bit of a function of what's the macro environment and the
forward view on commodity price. But we're in a position that I think you can expect us to continue to
high-grade our portfolio.
Douglas Todd Terreson
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division
Yes. So maybe I should ask it differently. So it seems like you guys are experiencing healthy enough
appetite for assets, if you're a seller. Is that a good way to think about it?

It was just -- it was actually on the reserve replacement. In 2018, you had 136%. That's a pretty
impressive figure given the growth trajectory over the last few years. I was wondering if you could just
disaggregate some of the impacts there, particularly on the price impacts in terms of revisions from '17 to
'18? And then what the key kind of moving parts were?
Michael K. Wirth
Chairman & CEO
Yes. So we did have another strong year. And our largest adds came through our Permian shale and tight
activity, through other shale and tight and some of these other basins we've been talking about, Gorgon
and Wheatstone. So primarily in the unconventionals, with contributions across the board from Australia,
Canada, Asia, Gulf of Mexico, Eurasia, price was relatively small, negative revision, less than 100 million
barrels on price. We produced just short of 1.1 billion barrels. We sold about 60 million barrels. So it
was -- there was not a big price impact in there and while unconventionals were the big piece, we had
contributions from others. The one thing that I would call your attention to is what we view as very high-
quality reserve additions. They are barrels that bring with them lower risk, that's lower execution risk
and lower geologic risk, and lower breakeven prices. And so we would expect to continue to have a good,
strong reserve replacement story as we go forward, given the quality of our portfolio and the continued
improvements that we see, particularly in our unconventional development activities.
All right. Well, that is the top of the hour. I want to thank everybody for your time today, and I appreciate
your interest in Chevron and everyone's participation on the call. And I look forward to seeing many, if not
