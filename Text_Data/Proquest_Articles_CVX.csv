Chevron Corp.
Spending projections are sliding at two of the world's energy giants. Chevron Corp. on Thursday said it will cut its annual capital spending budget by 26% next year and sharply through the middle of next decade, as the coronavirus pandemic forces an industry-wide reappraisal of fossil fuel investment. That followed Exxon Mobil Corp.'s retreat from a plan to increase spending to boost its oil-and-gas production as the struggling company reassesses its next decade. Chevron shares fell 0.1 % Thursday.
General Motors Co.
General Motors Co. is tapping the brakes on its relationship with electric-truck startup Nikola Corp. The Detroit auto giant revealed Monday it is scaling back a pact that had fueled investor enthusiasm for both companies. Under the revised deal, GM still intends to provide Nikola with fuel-cell technology but is scrapping plans to build an electric pickup truck called the Badger for Nikola and will no longer take a stake in the company. The move comes after a short seller's report raised questions about the readiness of some aspects of Nikola's business, allegations the company said were false and misleading. GM shares fell 2.7% Monday.
Kohl's Corp.
A new face-off is unfolding in the world of beauty. Sephora plans to install 850 shops inside Kohl's Corp. stores by 2023, upending the beauty retailer's longstanding partnership with J.C. Penney Co. That follows Ulta Beauty Inc.'s deal announced in November to open more than 100 shops inside Target Corp. stores by next year. Beauty has been one of retail's brighter spots during the pandemic. Department stores are struggling to find new revenue sources as shoppers turn to fast-fashion chains, discount retailers and e-commerce players. Shares of Kohl's rose 13% Tuesday.
Zoom Video Communications Inc.
Investors may have Zoom fatigue. Despite posting another quarter of record sales and lifting its outlook due to the proliferation of remote working and distance schooling, Zoom Video Communications Inc. reported higher costs that disappointed holders of the company's stock. Zoom has been providing some of its services free to users, and that is weighing on its profitability, Zoom said Monday. Gross margin for the quarter fell to 67%, down from 71% in the prior three-month period, as the company spent heavily on its cloud-computing needs. Shares dropped 15% on Tuesday.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.
So long, Silicon Valley. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co.—a descendant of the firm that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard famously started in their Palo Alto, Calif., garage—is moving its headquarters to the Houston area , the latest sign that Silicon Valley is losing some of its gravitational pull. HPE said the cheaper real estate in Texas would help it save money, and hiring is also generally cheaper and less competitive in that state than in California. The company is currently based in San Jose. That city's mayor, Democrat Sam Liccardo, said HPE's decision was ""a wake-up call."" HPE shares rose 2.9% Wednesday.
3M Co.
Masks are not offering enough protection to 3M Co. The industrial conglomerate said Thursday it plans to cut 2,900 jobs to account for slumping demand for some products during the pandemic. The St. Paul, Minn.-based company produces N95 face masks that protect medical workers and others from the virus. But sales of 3M's office supplies, industrial products and other goods have slumped as people stayed home from work and postponed dental appointments and medical procedures. 3M has said nonemergency medical procedures are unlikely to recover through next year as people stay away from facilities where patients are being treated for coronavirus. Shares of 3M fell less than 0.1% Thursday.
AT&T Inc.
A Hollywood giant is blurring the traditional boundaries between your TV screen and the neighborhood movie theater. AT&T Inc.'s Warner Bros. said it will release its entire 2021 slate of theatrical films simultaneously in theaters and on its HBO Max streaming service , taking the most drastic step yet in eliminating the exclusivity theater chains have enjoyed for decades. Warner Bros. movies will play on HBO Max during their first month of theatrical release before leaving the service while staying in theaters. The hybrid model will apply to all of Warner Bros. films next year, from smaller-scale releases to big-budget movies that traditionally require gargantuan box-office sales to turn a profit. The head of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., the world's largest movie theater chain, said WarnerMedia must be willing to give up ""a considerable portion of the profitability"" of its studio division to ""subsidize"" HBO Max, adding ""we will do all in our power to ensure that Warner does not do so at our expense."" AT&T shares rose 0.5% Thursday."

Chevron Corp. said it would cut its annual capital spending budget by 26% next year and sharply through the middle of the decade, as the coronavirus pandemic forces an industrywide reappraisal of fossil-fuel investment.
Chevron said it would spend $14 billion next year and no more than $16 billion a year through 2025. It previously said it would spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year through 2024 before the pandemic.
The reductions by the U.S. oil giant follow those announced this week by rival Exxon Mobil Corp., which on Monday said it was reducing its yearly capital spending by about $5 billion to $10 billion each year through 2025. Exxon, which has lost more than $2.3 billion over the first three quarters of this year, also said it would slash the book value of its assets by up to $20 billion.
By some measures, the pandemic hit the energy industry harder than any other major segment of the U.S. economy in 2020. Oil-and-gas companies collectively lost more market value, on a percentage basis, from the beginning of the year than any other major sector. Dozens of companies sought chapter 11 protection from creditors, while tens of thousands of oil workers have lost their jobs.
The sizable spending cuts by Exxon and Chevron this week mean that there will be even less work for the oil-field services companies that employ many of the industry's ground-level workers, and that oil regions in many parts of the world will see reduced economic activity.
""Chevron remains committed to capital discipline with a 2021 capital budget and longer-term capital outlook that are well below our prior guidance,"" Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth said.
In October, Chevron told investors it would spend around $14 billion in 2021 and indicated its long-term budget could be reduced as well. Chevron has lost nearly $5 billion this year, but unlike Exxon has managed to avoid taking on large amounts of new debt due to a relatively strong balance sheet.
The company's share price is down about 5% over the past six months and closed at $89.78, up 0.1%, Thursday.
Pierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said the company's spending plans represent an expectation of lower commodity prices over the next five years.
""It also reflects that we are an industry performing poorly relative to other investment opportunities,"" Mr. Breber said. ""Everything [Chevron is] looking at is through the lens of capital discipline and generating higher returns.""
Covid-19 has gutted demand for oil and gas as automobile and plane travel declined sharply amid global lockdowns and other measures to contain the virus. Chevron has let its production slide due to the weakened demand, choosing to give priority to directing its cash flow to dividend payments. It reiterated Thursday its commitment to its dividend.
Even before the pandemic, the fossil-fuel industry was contending with an oversupply of oil and gas unleashed by U.S. frackers, increased competition from renewable-energy sources and electric vehicles, while also contending with the prospect of increased climate-change regulation.
Since the end of last year, Chevron has been implementing a year-long restructuring in response to an anticipated period of prolonged low commodity prices. It is in the process of cutting up to 15% of its 45,000-person staff.
In July, Chevron agreed to acquire Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, one of the larger energy deals this year. Chevron didn't say Thursday how much of its capital spending would be directed to Noble's assets. It previously said it expects about $300 million in annual cost savings from integrating Noble.
Paul Sankey, lead analyst at Sankey Research, said Chevron's capital cuts are significant, especially because Noble wasn't factored into the prior spending guidance. Still, Mr. Sankey said Chevron is in a better position than many of its peers. ""Chevron came into 2020 best prepared in terms of capex and balance sheet, and leaves 2020 in best shape,"" he said.
Chevron said it would increase investments in its stronger assets, including offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and in U.S. shale, including in the Permian Basin in New Mexico and Texas. It also said it would invest $300 million in projects related to a transition to a lower-carbon-energy economy."

| Jump to first hit SENATORS aired misgivings on Tuesday over potential violations of the law in Udenna's purchase of the shares of Chevron Corp. in the consortium that runs the Malampaya gas field in Palawan.
At the Senate Energy Committee hearing on Resolution 533 to look into the Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to-Power-Project, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, panel chairman, noted there was no prior approval by the Department of Energy (DOE) of the purchase by Udenna of 45 percent shares of Chevron in the Malampaya gas project.
Gatchalian was referring to the March 11, 2020 buy in deal by Davao-based businessman Dennis Uy's Udenna of the Chevron shares amounting to $565 million.
The Senate panel was told that the DOE was reportedly informed only on October 28,2020, after the 'done deal' even as it was supposed to have been submitted for prior scrutiny by the DOE to assess the 'technical capability' of Udenna to enter
Malampaya.
Energy Assistant Secretary Leonido Pulido, however, explained they saw no violation in the sale of Chevron shares, adding there was no issue involving the actual operations of Malampaya, as Shell will run the gas project.
He added that the DOE is also evaluating the capability of Udenna, which is said to be entering into such an energy project for the first time, prompting Senator Imee Marcos to ask if this is 'incomplete' and could then be considered as not a done deal yet.
DOE officials, however, explained that the deal to buy in shares could not be considered incomplete, but added it is 'voidable,' indicating the contract could be voided if the DOE does not approve the sale.
In turn, Senator Panfilo Lacson wanted to know the DOE back-up plan if the sale of shares collapses and a case is brought to the Supreme Court. Lacson likewise asked about the option to acquire the Chevron shares by the state's Philippine National Oil Co.
The PNOC, however, told the Senate panel that 'technically and financially' they were not ready to take over the Malampaya gas project even as Udenna affirmed the legitimacy of their transaction.
Apart from Udenna, senators were told that among those reported to be interested in Malampaya shares were San Miguel Corporation and the PXP Energy Corporation of businessman Manuel V. Pangilinan."

LONDON—Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would start raising its dividend again—after slashing it just months earlier—and planned to eventually increase shareholder payouts further, projecting an upbeat assessment of its ability to weather the pandemic-induced oil-demand shock.
The pandemic forced Shell to reduce its dividend by two-thirds in April— its first cut since World War II —and helped trigger a restructuring of the company, part of a broader plan at Shell to accelerate investments in low-carbon energy.
The company is now increasing its dividend 4% to 16.65 cents a share and said that once it has reduced its debt to $65 billion, it would aim to give 20% to 30% of cash flow from operations back to shareholders. Shell's debt was $73.5 billion at the end of September.
""The strength of our performance gives us the confidence to lay out our strategic direction, resume dividend growth and to provide clarity on the cash allocation framework, with clear parameters to increase shareholder distributions,"" said Chief Executive Ben van Beurden.
Shell now plans to spend 25% of its annual $19 billion-to-$22 billion investment budget on ""the future of energy businesses"" which include marketing, power, hydrogen and biofuels, up from an average of 11% over the past three years.
Shell intends to focus on investing in oil projects that have the highest returns, while growing its liquefied natural gas business. It will shrink its refining portfolio to six energy and chemical parks, from the current 14 sites.
The accelerated investment plans in low-carbon energy follow a similar move by BP PLC, which said in September it would cut its oil and gas production by 40% over the next decade and increase its expenditure on renewables and other low-carbon energy sources.
Mr. van Beurden declined to say whether Shell's oil production would shrink, saying the company was focused on value, not volume. The company plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs , about 11% of its workforce, following similar cost-saving moves at Chevron Corp. and BP.
Shell's third-quarter performance was hurt by lower refining margins and a fall in refining activity, along with lower margins in its LNG business, as lower crude prices started to filter through to LNG contracts linked to oil prices.
Refining can act as a hedge for major oil companies during times of lower energy prices, but recently even these areas haven't been as profitable. Refining margins have in the past risen when oil prices fell, but fuel demand is also weak, with people driving and flying less because of Covid-19.
Shell said that its gas-trading results were lower than during the comparable period a year ago. BP, which posted earnings earlier this week, also said trading suffered.
Shell further reduced the value of its giant floating gas project Prelude by around $1 billion. In July, the company cut the value of its assets by $16.8 billion and didn't give a breakdown of projects affected, but about $4 billion was attributed to Prelude, said a person familiar with the matter.
During the second quarter, oil prices plummeted as countries locked down to slow the spread of the virus. More recently, lower volatility has reduced trading opportunities as Brent oil prices have stabilized at around $40 a barrel.
Shell reported a third-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis—a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report—of $177 million Thursday. That compared with a profit of $6.08 billion in the same period last year.
The company said that its marketing division reported strong margins, which helped offset lower sales volumes.
Shell's shares traded up 1.5% Thursday.
""We have challenged the lack of a clear financial framework since the dividend cut in April, and the plan set out by the Shell management team clearly addresses this,"" said Lydia Rainforth, an analyst at Barclays.
Shell said it would give more information in February on how its restructuring feeds into its strategy, including details on its future portfolio, and plans for low-carbon energy investments.
Its gearing level—net debt as a percentage of total capital—was 31.4% for the three months to the end of September, down from 32.7% in the previous quarter and above the company's target of 25%.
The company said it expected divestment proceeds of $4 billion a year on average, helping reduce net debt.
U.S. oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp. are due to report results Friday. Exxon has already indicated a potential loss from its oil-and-gas production business.

| Jump to first hitConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for about US$9.7 billion in stock, the largest shale industry deal since the collapse in energy demand earlier this year and one that will create a heavyweight driller in America's most prolific oilfield.
Investors will get 1.46 Conoco shares for each Concho share, the companies said Monday in a statement. The transaction represents a 15 per cent premium over Concho's closing price on Oct. 13, the last trading session before Bloomberg News first reported the companies were in talks.
The pandemic-induced price crash and lacklustre global economic recovery have accelerated the push for consolidation across the shale patch, which is under severe financial strain after years of debt-fuelled growth.
The combination of Conoco and Concho will be one of the dominant operators in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, rivalling only the likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. in terms of crude output.
The deal may also signal further mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Despite a compelling rationale for more consolidation in order to cut costs, a lack of cash and Wall Street's antipathy toward the sector has, until recently, made it hard to get deals across the line.
But with oil stable at around US$40 a barrel, there are signs that M&A is now gaining momentum. Chevron Corp. completed its acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. in early October, and in late September Devon Energy Corp. announced it was buying Permian operator WPX Energy Inc. Unlike some shale deals in 2019, Devon's tie-up with WPX was well-received, with both companies agreeing on a small deal premium. That follows investor criticism of some deal premiums last year for being excessive.
The Concho takeover is Conoco's biggest under its current chief executive, Ryan Lance, who until now has sought to position the company almost as an anti-shale option for Wall Street, touting little-to-no-growth, steady cash flow and disciplined spending.
While Lance has made no secret of his desire to take advantage of the downturn to expand in shale, he said in July that any transaction must meet Conoco's criteria of having a low cost of supply while being able to compete with the rest of the company's portfolio.
Houston-based Conoco emerged from the oil market slump in a relatively strong position with about US$7 billion of cash on hand. It recently resumed share buybacks.
But its growth outlook is challenged: second-quarter production was down by almost 25 per cent from a year earlier after it joined many other U.S. drillers in curbing output in response to lower prices.
Conoco and Concho said on a conference call that the deal didn't arise from a need to fix anything but rather a desire to bulk up.
""Evaluating the go-forward size and scale really becomes more and more important,"" Concho CEO Tim Leach, who will be executive vice-president and president of the merged companies'operations in the lower 48 U.S. states, said on the call. ""The 'why now'is that we have common vision on this, and creating a company that can attract capital and be a leader in that regard is the compelling reason why we wanted to move now.""
Adding Concho will dramatically alter Conoco's production profile. The Midland, Texas-based shale company is entirely focused on the Permian and pumped 319,000 barrels in the second quarter, about six times what Conoco produced there.
The combination will save US$500 million a year by 2022, and hand shareholders more than 30 per cent of cash from operations through dividends and other distributions, the companies said.
Concho ""was an attractive company and had one of the deepest tier 1 resource bases in shale,"" analysts at Wells Fargo said in a note. With a deal premium of 15 per cent along with the projected efficiencies, Conoco ""seems to be getting a bargain.""
Though the transaction may be good for shareholders, the extensive cost cuts mean it's unlikely to benefit already declining U.S. oil production, or the companies like Halliburton Co. who provide drilling and other services. Halliburton said Monday that business outside the U.S. is still weak.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is Conoco's financial adviser on the deal and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is its legal adviser. Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are Concho's financial advisers and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is its legal adviser.
Concho's shares rose 0.14 per cent to US$48.67 as of early afternoon trading in New York while Conoco's dropped 0.7 per cent to US$33.54.

| Jump to first hitConocoPhillips agreed to buy Concho Resources Inc. for about US$9.7 billion in stock, the largest shale industry deal since the collapse in energy demand earlier this year and one that will create a heavyweight driller in America's most prolific oilfield.
Investors will get 1.46 Conoco shares for each Concho share, the companies said Monday in a statement. The transaction represents a 15 per cent premium over Concho's closing price on Oct. 13, the last trading session before Bloomberg News first reported the companies were in talks.
The pandemic-induced price crash and lacklustre global economic recovery have accelerated the push for consolidation across the shale patch, which is under severe financial strain after years of debt-fuelled growth.
The combination of Conoco and Concho will be one of the dominant operators in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, rivalling only the likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Chevron Corp. in terms of crude output.
The deal may also signal further mergers and acquisitions in the sector. Despite a compelling rationale for more consolidation in order to cut costs, a lack of cash and Wall Street's antipathy toward the sector has, until recently, made it hard to get deals across the line.
But with oil stable at around US$40 a barrel, there are signs that M&A is now gaining momentum. Chevron Corp. completed its acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. in early October, and in late September Devon Energy Corp. announced it was buying Permian operator WPX Energy Inc. Unlike some shale deals in 2019, Devon's tie-up with WPX was well-received, with both companies agreeing on a small deal premium. That follows investor criticism of some deal premiums last year for being excessive.
The Concho takeover is Conoco's biggest under its current chief executive, Ryan Lance, who until now has sought to position the company almost as an anti-shale option for Wall Street, touting little-to-no-growth, steady cash flow and disciplined spending.
While Lance has made no secret of his desire to take advantage of the downturn to expand in shale, he said in July that any transaction must meet Conoco's criteria of having a low cost of supply while being able to compete with the rest of the company's portfolio.
Houston-based Conoco emerged from the oil market slump in a relatively strong position with about US$7 billion of cash on hand. It recently resumed share buybacks.
But its growth outlook is challenged: second-quarter production was down by almost 25 per cent from a year earlier after it joined many other U.S. drillers in curbing output in response to lower prices.
Conoco and Concho said on a conference call that the deal didn't arise from a need to fix anything but rather a desire to bulk up.

| Jump to first hitChevron Corp. overtook Exxon Mobil Corp. as the largest oil company in America by market value, the first time the Texas-based giant has been dethroned since it began as Standard Oil more than a century ago.
California-based Chevron had a market capitalization of US$142 billion at the close of U.S. trading on Wednesday, compared with Exxon's US$141.6 billion.
The entire oil and gas sector is suffering from the plunge in energy prices this year caused by Covid-19. But Chevron has emerged with the strongest balance sheet among its Big Oil peers - it was able to complete its US$5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. last week.
Exxon, by contrast, is struggling to generate enough cash to pay for capital expenditures, leaving it reliant on debt and putting pressure on its US$15 billion-a-year dividend.
Chevron had been closing in on its longtime rival for more than a year, even before the pandemic crushed oil demand. Chief executive Mike Wirth has focused on Chevron's shale operations, cutting costs and keeping a tight rein on new projects. Exxon pursued a series of expensive projects that promised growth after years of stagnating production, but which became a drag on its cash flow when the pandemic hit.
The American giants'biggest European rivals, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, face problems of their own - their shares slumped after cutting their prized dividends earlier this year. Some analysts believe Exxon may be next in line to cut its payout. The U.S. company will be unable to fund its dividend without drawing down cash or selling assets before 2025, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note Tuesday.
Fossil-fuel producers are under mounting pressure to be more transparent about their greenhouse gas emissions and to help combat climate change.
Chevron said Wednesday it is doubling down on its plan to turn cow manure into renewable natural gas.
The oil major formed a joint venture with waste solutions manager Brightmark LLC to build biomethane projects in multiple states, marking its second foray into producing renewable gas from dairy waste. Chevron plans to then buy the biomethane to power its trucks, buses and other vehicles.

Major oil companies signaled they remain under extreme financial pressure and oil prices slid Thursday as demand for fossil fuels rebounds slowly after being crushed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Despite a modest economic recovery, oil-and-gas companies are being hammered by a sustained drop in consumption of gasoline and jet fuel as millions of people work from home and avoid driving and flying. That is combining with longer-term concerns about future competition from renewable energy and electric vehicles to drag down the value of many oil-and-gas companies to decade lows.
A stock index of U.S. oil-and-gas companies is down about 57% in 2020 even as the overall stock market is up slightly. On Thursday, the share prices of Royal Dutch Shell PLC and BP PLC hit fresh 25-year-lows, and Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. dropped. U.S. crude prices fell to $38.58 a barrel, levels at which most companies cannot produce profitably.
Exxon and Shell said this week that key parts of their business continued to struggle through the summer and early fall, which will weigh down third-quarter results.
Exxon warned Thursday that it expected earnings from its oil-production unit to improve by as much as $1.8 billion from the second quarter, but that its natural-gas sales and its refining business could lose more money. Analysts forecast a quarterly loss of more than $500 million when the company reports on Oct. 30, which would mark its third consecutive quarter in the red.
Shell said Wednesday it would cut up to 9,000 jobs in a broad restructuring and warned it was also poised to report poor third-quarter earnings, including a second consecutive quarterly loss in its oil-and-gas production business. The planned job cuts follow similar moves at peers including BP and Chevron Corp. to rein in costs amid the pandemic. Exxon has said it is conducting a workforce review, which might lead to layoffs.
Lousy oil-and-gas earnings this year have turned off many investors, who remain unenthusiastic about the sector despite a modest rebound in crude prices from the historic lows.
Smaller, independent players continue to struggle for survival. On Wednesday, Houston-based shale driller Oasis Petroleum Inc. filed for chapter 11, joining at least three dozen other North American oil-and-gas producers in seeking bankruptcy protection this year, according to law firm Haynes and Boone LLP. ""Due to historically low global energy demand and commodity prices, we determined that it is best for Oasis Petroleum to take decisive action to strengthen our liquidity and overcome the headwinds now challenging both our company and industry,"" Oasis Chief Executive Thomas Nusz said in a statement.
As the number of global Covid-19 infections continues to rise, the return of restrictions that could reduce the number of cars on the road and overall economic activity is leading to market pessimism that oil demand will take a long time to recover. Russia's energy ministry has said it doesn't expect a fast recovery, while Vitol Group, the world's biggest independent oil trader, said it doesn't expect oil prices to rise until 2021.
""The demand side of the equation will continue to be under threat during the fourth quarter of the year, with Covid-19 cases rising at an alarming rate, notably in Europe, which has already imposed new restrictions to curve down the number of cases,"" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, an analyst at Rystad Energy.
Rystad expects about 150 additional North American oil and gas producers to file for bankruptcy by the end of 2022 if crude prices remain around $40 a barrel.
The U.S. is now generating fewer than 11 million barrels of oil daily, down from around 13 million barrels a day early this year, Energy Information Administration data show. Two-thirds of oil-and-gas executives who responded to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said they think U.S. oil production will never fully recover.
Meanwhile, domestic consumption of gasoline and distillates including diesel remains depressed, down about 9% from a year ago, according to the EIA. That is weighing on refiners such as Marathon Petroleum Corp., which said Wednesday that it was laying off some 2,000 employees. In all, Marathon Petroleum is cutting around 12% of its jobs, excluding roles at its Speedway gas station chain, which 7-Eleven Inc. has agreed to buy.
For major oil companies with large liquefied-natural-gas businesses, analysts expect weaker margins. LNG is sold via long-term contracts where prices are often linked to oil with a time lag of three to six months. That means the fall in oil prices earlier this year reached LNG only during the third quarter.
Longer-term doubts are also clouding the industry's outlook. BP said in September that global oil demand could have already peaked and that it would potentially never recover to pre-pandemic levels.
BP, Shell and other major European fossil-fuel companies have said they plan to invest heavily in renewable energy over the next decade. Exxon, Chevron and most U.S. shale companies remain committed to oil and gas.
Still, some executives are hopeful that the reduced investment in oil and gas production this year will result in higher oil prices in the future. Total SA has drawn up a 10-year investment plan based on a $50 a barrel price for the Brent crude oil benchmark. On Thursday, Brent oil traded for around $41 a barrel.

| Jump to first hitChevron Corporation has told its employees around the world to delete Tencent’s WeChat app from their work phones, describing it as a “non-compliant application” in a staff email seen by Bloomberg News.  Any staff that don't delete the Chinese social media and chat app will have their access to Chevron's internal system revoked, it said.  The American oil giant is one of the first companies in the US to take the Trump administration’s ban of the social media and chat app on board.  A federal judge blocked the US government from banning WeChat app downloads from Sunday, September 20. The US Commerce Department said it will challenge the order, and that the app poses a national security risk. 
US oil company Chevron has ordered staff worldwide to delete WeChat off their work phones, despite President Donald Trump's ban on the app being blocked by a federal court.
Chevron described WeChat, owned by Chinese tech giant Tencent, as a ""non-compliant application."" Staff would be disconnected from the firm's internal network unless they remove the social-media-and-chat app from their devices, according to a staff email seen by Bloomberg News.
""Due to a recent Executive Order banning the use of WeChat, Chevron is requiring that you remove the application from your mobile device,"" the memo said. ""If no action is taken, prior to September 27, 2020, your access to the Chevron system will be removed.""
Chevron and Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A government executive order published Friday, September 18, said that WeChat and video-sharing app TikTok would be banned from Sunday, September 20 onwards, preventing US citizens from downloading or updating the app from Apple or Google's app stores.
However, a federal judge in California blocked the Trump administration from banning the app on Saturday, September 19, saying the ban violated free speech rights. Bloomberg first reported that US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler issued a preliminary injunction, stating in the ruling that WeChat ""serves as a virtual public square for the Chinese-speaking and Chinese-American community in the United States.""
Banning it ""forecloses meaningful access to communication in their community and thereby operates as a prior restraint on their right to free speech,"" Beeler added.
In response, the US Commerce Department said Monday it would challenge the order because the ban is ""necessary to protect the national security of the United States,"" per Reuters.

Norway's largest private money manager, Storebrand Asset Management, excluded and divested itself of more than two dozen listed companies under its new climate change policy, citing concerns with lobbying, coal and oil sands.
The investment firm, a unit of insurer Storebrand ASA with around $91 billion under management, said Monday it sold off more than $47 million in 21 companies and excluded another six from future investments.
Storebrand's decision comes as more investors in Europe and abroad have called for polluting companies to align their lobbying and businesses with the Paris Agreement on climate change, with some threatening to divest.
Under its new policy, Storebrand said it would no longer invest in companies that earn more than 5% of revenue from coal or oil sands or that lobby against the Paris Agreement, among other criteria. The companies Storebrand exited from are mostly in oil and gas and the broader energy sector.
Jan Erik Saugestad, chief executive of Storebrand AM, said in an interview that the companies the firm divested itself of aren't on track to transition to a lower-carbon economy and are too risky in the long term.
""Companies that don't recognize climate risk or do not seize those opportunities are, in our mind, less attractive,"" he said.
Big names Storebrand exited from due to their lobbying activities were U.S. oil-and-gas giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., German chemical maker BASF SE, and Australian miner Rio Tinto Ltd.
A spokesman for Exxon, which Storebrand divested itself of nearly $12.3 million, pointed to a statement from Stephen Littleton, vice president of investor relations, that was made in advance of this year's shareholder meeting following criticism from some investors of its lobbying. Mr. Littleton said Exxon would provide more disclosures on its lobbying.
""We recognize not all shareholders will agree on the best way to manage risks, and we respect those with different perspectives and welcome their engagement,"" he said in May.
A spokesman for Chevron, from which Storebrand pulled more than $10 million, said the board of the San Ramon, Calif.-based oil giant is carefully considering a shareholder resolution that would require it to disclose lobbying on climate change.
""We are not always aligned with all the views of those organizations, but it's important for us to be part of conversations on challenging issues where there are multiple points of view,"" the spokesman said.
A BASF spokesman said it wouldn't comment on moves by shareholders, but stressed that the chemical maker ""clearly supports the Paris Climate Agreement."" Storebrand pulled more than $2.7 million from the company.
A Rio Tinto spokesman also declined to comment on its shareholders, but pointed to disclosures it provides on its website regarding its lobbying. Storebrand pulled nearly $3.8 million from the mining company.
ConocoPhillips, which Storebrand divested itself of close to $4 million over its oil-sands business, declined to comment.
In Asia, Storebrand sold more than $373,000 from Taiwan Cement Corp. and more than $313,000 from Japan's Kansai Electric Power Co., both due to their coal activities.
The companies said through spokespeople that they are working to cut their emissions and become more energy efficient, though Kansai declined to comment directly on Storebrand's decision.
Taiwan Cement's spokesperson said the Taipei-based company ""has been striving to become a green environmental engineering company"" because of advice from shareholders.
Mr. Saugestad of Storebrand said he hopes the new policy serves as an example for other investors and inspires them to follow suit.
""It's a natural step in evolution,"" Mr. Saugestad said.

Chevron Corp. is in talks to invest in a major Iraq oil field, according to Iraqi officials, part of a string of prospective deals with U.S. companies signaling confidence in that country's energy industry despite years of instability and start-and-stop foreign investment.
Chevron and the Iraqi government tentatively plan to sign a memorandum of understanding to develop one of Iraq's large oil fields in the south of the country, according to these officials. The preliminary deal, if it is consummated, could be announced later this week during a planned visit to Washington by Iraq's new prime minister. He is expected to meet President Trump on Thursday.
On the sidelines of the visit, U.S. and Iraqi officials also intend to unveil progress toward finalizing natural-gas and power-technology deals with Honeywell International Inc., General Electric Co., and Stellar Energy, the officials said.
Any deal with Chevron would be limited in scope -- calling for an investment on the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars once it is finalized, according to these people. That is a relatively small commitment for an oil company the size of Chevron, but it comes at a time when the entire industry has scaled back spending. Oil demand has fallen dramatically amid pandemiclockdowns and economic uncertainty.
Chevron's discussions focus on exploration work in the Nassiriya field, estimated to hold about 4.4 billion barrels of crude, according to the people familiar with the matter. The field isn't one of the country's easiest to explore. It requires the sort of complex technologies that big, international oil companies like Chevron can provide, these people said.
The global oil-and-gas industry is in a deep retrenchment after the coronavirus dramatically lowered demand for hydrocarbons. The sector's largest companies have announced layoffs and cut billions of dollars from capital budgets. Chevron said earlier this year it would cut its spending by $4 billion, or 20%. It plans to lay off as much as 15% of its staff.
Still, Chevron has shown a willingness to spend despite the market uncertainty. Chevron entered the pandemic with a relatively strong balance sheet and in July agreed to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, in what would be the largest oil-patch tie-up since the pandemic took hold.
A spokeswoman said Chevron doesn't comment on matters of a commercial nature. A spokesman for the Iraqi oil ministry didn't return a request for comment.
New Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi is set to meet Mr. Trump on Thursday to discuss the pandemic, the fight against terrorism and other issues, including energy cooperation, the White House has said.
Mr. Kadhimi's government is also planning to sign interim agreements with U.S. companies that will help his country's power sector, where $2 billion of natural gas is wasted instead of being redirected to electricity plants.
Washington has encouraged the deals, seeing them as a way to reduce Iraq's dependency on Iran's energy supplies -- a longstanding demand from the Trump administration, Iraqi officials say.
The Iraqis are set to disclose new steps toward contracts with Honeywell to help develop the $2.2 billion Ar Ratawi gas hub, and deals with Stellar Energy and GE to rebuild the electricity system, Iraqi officials said. Honeywell, GE and Stellar didn't return requests for comment.
The companies' decision to pursue projects in Iraq underscores that country's longtime lure. As with some of its Mideast neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, Iraqi crude is often relatively easy and cheap to tap. That has spurred interest among the world's biggest oil companies, but that enthusiasm has long been tempered by political instability.
Baghdad opened its fields up to foreign investment in the aftermath of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. What followed were years of political instability and what industry officials have sometimes deemed unattractive terms offered by successive governments.
More recent attempts by foreign firms to enter the country -- the fastest-growing oil producer in the Middle East -- have been stymied by a fresh wave of popular unrest and tensions between Baghdad and Washington.
Starting in October, protests against perceived corruption and mismanagement spilled into the streets. That triggered the resignation of the cabinet of former Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi in December. He agreed to stay as a caretaker but was unable to make key decisions. Iraqi relations with the U.S. also frayed in January after the killing of a top Iranian general by Washington in Baghdad.
In May, the Iraqi parliament appointed intelligence chief Mustafa al-Kadhimi as prime minister. He has maintained friendly relations with Washington. New Oil Minister Ihsan Ismaael was anointed the next month, prompting U.S. companies to restart talks to get business in the Iraqi oil sector, the people familiar with the matter say.
Exxon Mobil Corp. has also restarted talks for another stage of its West Qurna 2 oil-field development in Iraq, people familiar with the matter said. But the U.S. oil giant hasn't made progress in discussions to move ahead with its much-bigger Iraq bet, called the South Integrated Project, according to these people.

| Jump to first hitUnited States energy giants Exxon lost $1.1bln and Chevron lost $8.27bln in the second quarter as coronavirus lockdowns shuttered businesses and forced consumers to shelter in place, gutting crude demand in the US and around the world.Exxon, the Irving, Texas-based oil giant, brought in $32.6bln in revenue during the second quarter, less than half of what it brought in at the same time last year, according to Al-Jazeera.The quarter was one of the worst on record for the oil industry. A roughly 30 million barrel-a-day drop in global crude demand resulting from lockdowns and a halt in air travel was exacerbated by a price war initiated by Saudi Arabia.In April, with the world awash in crude and storage space on land and at sea filling up, the price of US benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude turned negative for the first time ever as traders paid to have oil they had contracted for delivery taken off their hands rather than scramble for a place to store it.Exxon announced that month that it would cut its capital spending budget by 30 percent to $23bln, and its cash operating expenses by 15 percent, in 2020.On Friday, the company's Senior Vice President Neil Chapman stated it expects to spend less than $19bln next year, which would be the lowest for the company since at least 2005.Oil prices have recovered somewhat since April's historic rout, but have been stuck at about $40 a barrel for weeks. That is roughly 30 percent less than a barrel fetched a year ago and well below what most US producers need to cover their cost of production. As a result, the US oil industry has lost more than 100,000 jobs since February, with 45,000 of those shed by upstream oil and gas companies in Texas alone, according to Rystad Energy, a consulting firm.""The global pandemic and oversupply conditions significantly impacted our second quarter financial results with lower prices, margins, and sales volumes,"" said Darren Woods, chairman and CEO, in a statement on Friday, adding, ""We responded decisively by reducing near-term spending and continuing work to improve efficiency by leveraging recent reorganizations.""Exxon Mobil Corporation produced 3.6 million barrels of oil-equivalent, down 7 percent from last year. That included a 12 percent drop in natural gas production.Chevron Corp lost $8.27bn during the quarter, a sharp contrast to the $4.3bln it brought in during the same quarter last year.The San Ramon-based oil giant brought in $13.49bln in revenue, about a third of what it brought in last year.""The past few months have presented unique challenges,"" said Michael Wirth, Chevron's chairman of the board and CEO, in a statement, adding, ""The economic impact of the response to COVID-19 significantly reduced demand for our products and lowered commodity prices.""Phillips 66, the Houston-based oil refining and logistics company, lost $141mln during the quarter. -FNA"

Amazon.com Inc.
Big tech keeps getting bigger despite concerns about their size and influence. Amazon.com, Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc. delivered soaring quarterly sales and profit Thursday, highlighting the resiliency of their operations during the pandemic. The results came a day after their CEOs faced scrutiny from Congress about their business practices. Amazon shares gained 3.7% Friday.
Altria Group Inc.
Smoking is making a comeback. Marlboro maker Altria said Tuesday that Americans are lighting up more during the pandemic, enough to slow the yearslong decline in U.S. cigarette sales. People are spending more on cigarettes as they spend less on travel and entertainment and have more time to smoke at home, Chief Executive Billy Gifford said. Stimulus checks and increased unemployment benefits also helped ease the financial hardship for low- and middle-income cigarette smokers. Adult smokers are making fewer trips to the store, but they are stocking up on packs when they go. Altria shares added 0.9% Tuesday.
McDonald's Corp.
McDonald's investors aren't ""loving it."" The fast-food giant said its profit suffered a deeper-than-expected drop during its most recent quarter, as the coronavirus shut restaurants around the world. The company said it spent $200 million to help franchisees advertise their restaurants and boost sales, while restaurant margins fell 25% as owners spent on personal-protection equipment for workers and free meals for first responders. To-go sales have helped McDonald's U.S. operations, where nearly 95% of locations have drive-throughs. As coronavirus cases rise, the company will likely continue to depend on drive-throughs for the near future. McDonald's shares fell 2.5% Tuesday.
Procter & Gamble Co.
Now more than ever, consumers want to keep their houses clean. That was evident in numbers released Thursday by the maker of household staples from Bounty paper towels to Tide laundry detergent. P&G posted its strongest annual sales gain since 2006 as the pandemic kept the world's consumers at home and vigilant about cleanliness . Demand in the U.S. surged through the spring and early summer, while the reopening of China, P&G's second-biggest market, drove sales there. Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller expects consumers' hygiene needs have changed forever, saying it's ""hard to imagine we'll snap back to the old world."" P&G shares rose 2.4% Thursday.
Kellogg Co.
The pandemic hoarding may be over, but consumers still can't get enough of certain favorites . Cereal and snack maker Kellogg said its North American cereal sales increased more than 15%, and 26% for its Eggo frozen breakfast items. Kellogg and fellow food maker Kraft Heinz Co. said they have increased their production capacity and continue to sell essentially everything they can make. The two companies are increasing advertising for the rest of the year in hopes of keeping their sales momentum going beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Kellogg shares fell 0.5% Thursday.
United Parcel Service Inc.
The online shopping boom delivered a surprise surge in demand for UPS. The delivery giant said on Thursday that its average daily shipping volume rose a record 21% in its June quarter. Shipments to homes increased 65% as well. Chief Executive Carol Tomé said UPS was planning for demand to pull back after the early days of the pandemic. The sudden growth does come at a cost: Carriers incur greater expenses from more miles driven and fewer packages delivered per stop as they deliver more to homes instead of businesses. Ms. Tomé said she sees room to raise rates on large retailers, who she said can pass them along to consumers by raising prices. UPS shares surged 14% Thursday.
Chevron Corp.
The tank is emptying at some of the world's oil giants. Chevron said Friday that it lost $8.3 billion in the second quarter , as the pandemic continues to sap global demand for fossil fuels. Chief Executive Mike Wirth said his company faced an uncertain future for energy demand and couldn't predict commodity prices with confidence right now. The dismal results from Chevron and its peers are exacerbating their existing struggles to attract investors, which many of the companies have sought to retain by paying out hefty dividends that are proving hard to sustain during the pandemic. Chevron shares fell 2.7% Friday.

Big oil companies endured one of their worst second quarters ever and are positioning themselves for prolonged pain as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sap global demand for fossil fuels.
Exxon Mobil Corp. posted a quarterly loss for the second straight quarter for the first time this century on Friday, reporting a loss of $1.1 billion, compared with a profit of $3.1 billion a year ago. Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, hadn't reported back-to-back losses for at least 22 years, according to Dow Jones Market Data, whose figures extend to 1998.
""The global pandemic and oversupply conditions significantly impacted our second-quarter financial results with lower prices, margins, and sales volumes,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.
Chevron Corp. said Friday it lost $8.3 billion in the second quarter, down from $4.3 billion in profits during the same period last year, its largest loss since at least 1998. It wrote down $5.7 billion in oil-and-gas properties, including $2.6 billion in Venezuela, citing uncertainty in the country ruled by strongman Nicolás Maduro. Chevron also said it lowered its internal estimates for future commodity prices.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SA reported significant losses in the second quarter earlier this week, as the impact of the pandemic and a worsening long-term outlook for commodity prices spurred them to write down the value of their assets.
The dismal results are ratcheting up the problems for the oil giants, which were struggling to attract investors even before the pandemic, as concerns over climate-change regulations and increasing competition from renewable energy and electric vehicles cloud the future for fossil fuels.
Holdings of oil-and-gas stocks by active money managers are at a 15-year low, according to investment bank Evercore ISI. BP PLC, Shell and Total are all trading at 30-year lows relative to the overall S&P 500. Exxon is trading at its lowest level to the S&P 500 since 1977, according to the bank.
Many of the big oil companies have sought to retain investors despite slowing growth and profits over the past decade by paying out hefty dividends, but those payouts are proving hard to sustain during the pandemic.
Crude prices have stabilized at around $40 a barrel, providing modest relief for the industry after U.S. oil prices briefly turned negative for the first time ever in April. But none of the world's largest oil companies now foresee a rapid recovery as countries continue to struggle with containing the coronavirus.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said his company faced an uncertain future for energy demand and couldn't predict commodity prices with confidence right now.
""We expect a choppy economy and a choppy market,"" Mr. Wirth said in an interview earlier in July. ""It all depends on the virus and the policies enacted to respond to it.""
Oil and gas production by both Exxon and Chevron decreased in the quarter, down 7% and 3%, respectively, from a year ago, as the companies shut off wells to avoid selling into a weak market. Exxon's production-and-exploration business lost $1.7 billion, which Exxon attributed to lower commodity prices. Chevron's production unit lost $6.1 billion.
U.S. oil prices closed below $40 per barrel Thursday for the first time in three weeks.
For the entire second quarter, U.S. oil prices averaged $28 per barrel and Brent crude averaged about $33, according to Dow Jones Market Data, prices at which even the largest oil companies struggle to turn a profit, analysts say.
While major stock indexes have recovered from April, when they fell to their lowest levels in years, oil and gas stocks have continued to lag despite the slight rebound in commodity prices.
Many of the world's largest energy companies, including Exxon and Chevron, have for years used an integrated business model, which has historically allowed them to weather most market conditions.
By owning oil and gas wells, along with the downstream plants to manufacture refined products like gasoline and chemicals, the companies were long able to capitalize in one sector of their business, regardless of whether oil prices were high or low.
But that model has failed to deliver strong returns for most of the past decade, as the world has faced a glut of fossil fuels triggered in part by America's fracking boom, and it isn't protecting the companies now, according to Evercore ISI analyst Doug Terreson.
""A broad-based reassessment of the capital-management programs at the big oils is required at this point,"" Mr. Terreson said.
Oil companies have been forced to take dramatic action to shore up their finances in recent months, including cutting tens of billions of dollars from their budgets and laying off thousands of employees.
Exxon, which had previously disclosed a 30% cut to capital expenditures in 2020, said on Friday it has ""identified significant potential for additional reductions"" and said capital spending in 2021 will be lower than this year's spending.
Its steepest cuts have been to U.S. shale drilling, particularly in the Permian Basin, the most active U.S. oil field, where it removed half of its drilling rigs and will cut half of the remaining 30 rigs by the end of year. Chevron is operating just four rigs in the Permian and said production there would decline around 7% this year.
Shell in April cut its dividend for the first time since World War II to avoid having to borrow to fund it. It reported a second-quarter loss of $18.4 billion on Thursday, which included a $16.8 billion write-down, while French giant Total posted an $8.4 billion loss including an $8.1 billion write-down. Both companies report net income attributable to shareholders, a proxy for net profits. BP reports Tuesday.
Excluding impairments, Shell and Total actually turned a profit during the quarter as their trading units helped stave off even larger losses.
Exxon and Chevron have promised they will maintain their dividends, viewed by many investors as the most attractive part of owning their stocks. Some analysts predict Exxon may be forced to cut its dividend in 2021 if market conditions don't recover.
Exxon's dividend payments cost the company almost $15 billion a year. The company's debt grew by $8.8 billion in the quarter, according to Goldman Sach Group Inc., which said Exxon will need oil prices around $75 per barrel in 2021 to cover its dividend payments from cash flow. Exxon said Friday it wouldn't take on additional debt.
Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of energy investment firm Pickering Energy Partners LP, said the industry can survive at $40 oil but needs significantly higher prices to thrive. According to Mr. Pickering, who said he holds small positions in Exxon and Chevron, oil companies will have to continue cost-cutting for the foreseeable future.
""You've got to assume that this is the world we're going to be in, Mr. Pickering said. ""And, if this is the world we're going to be in, the cost structure is too high.""

| Jump to first hitHOUSTON Chevron Corp. said on Monday it would buy oil and gas producer Noble Energy Inc. for about US$5 billion in stock, the first big energy deal since the coronavirus crisis crushed global fuel demand and sent crude prices to historic lows.
Chevron, which last year dropped its offer for Anadarko when Occidental Petroleum Corp. bid more, has been seen as a financially disciplined oil major best positioned to strike a deal during the downturn. This purchase boosts its investments in U.S. shale and in natural gas with Noble's flagship Leviathan field in Israel, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean.
The deal diversifies Chevron's energy assets and makes it the first oil major to enter Israel. It ""is a tremendous expression of confidence in the Israeli energy market,"" Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement.
The Israel assets ""will rebalance the portfolio towards gas and provide a springboard"" in the region, said Tom Ellacott, senior vice-president at Wood Mackenzie. Chevron's shift to more natural gas output comes as oil companies are under pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Gas is seen as a cleaner burning fuel.
Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth said the company was ""mindful"" of tensions between Israel and nearby countries where the company has business including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and the Kurdish region of Iraq. He said the company was ""apolitical"" and a ""commercial actor"" in the region.
""We engage with all of our different stakeholders as we go through something like this,"" Wirth said, declining to detail the timing of discussions with partner governments. ""We're certainly are mindful of the fact that there are political differences and tensions ...among those countries.""
Noble ""offers an unique combination of shale as well long-cycle assets,"" much as Anadarko would have, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones, adding that she thought the deal was unlikely to spark a wave of consolidation.
Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James, said a bidding war was unlikely, noting the smaller scale of this deal - US$5 billion versus the US$33 billion Chevron had offered for Anadarko. He said other ""prospective buyers would find it easier to replicate via other means.""
Noble's assets will expand Chevron's shale presence in Colorado and the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field where Chevron had been under pressure to expand. Last year's bid for Anadarko was an attempt to boost Permian production, but Chevron ultimately walked away and instead pocketed a US$1-billion break fee.
Since then, margins and drilling in the Permian have been decimated by the coronavirus crisis, which slammed fuel demand and pushed U.S. crude prices down to an average price of US$20 per barrel in April. Prices have rebounded, yet they remain depressed, making assets cheaper. Just seven months ago, Noble had a market capitalization of about US$12 billion.
Shares of Noble closed Monday at US$10.18, up 5.5 per cent, after falling more than 60 per cent this year through Friday's close. Chevron fell 2.2 per cent to US$85.27.
The offer values Noble at US$10.38 a share, a 7.5-percent premium to its Friday close. Including the company's debt pile, the deal is worth roughly US$13 billion.
Chevron is paying a ""moderate premium"" reflecting a cautious outlook, said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at data provider Enverus, who said ""there aren't that many companies with Chevron's balance sheet strength and investor support to make up a buyer base"" even though target companies are ""plentiful.""
Noble shareholders will own about three per cent of the combined company, after the deal closes, expected in the fourth quarter.
The deal will help save about US$300 million on an annual run-rate basis and add to free cash flow and earnings one year after closing, if global oil prices stay at US$40, Chevron said.
It would add about 18 per cent to Chevron's proved reserves. Noble had proved reserves of 2.05 billion barrels of oil and gas, while Chevron reported 11.4 billion.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Low oil prices meant consolidation was bound to happen in the energy sector. Chevron Corp. made the first move Monday morning, announcing a $5 billion bid for Noble Energy in an all-stock deal.
Chevron's shares fell 2.2% to $85.29 on NYSE, while Noble Energy gained 5.4% to $10.18 on Nasdaq on Monday.
The acquisition, expected to close in the fourth quarter, values Noble at a 7.6% premium over Friday's closing price. That pales in comparison to the 39% premium of Chevron's bid for Anadarko Petroleum last year, which -- fortunately, as it turns out -- was snatched by Occidental Petroleum.
The deal values Noble at eight times its expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2021, according to an estimate by Raymond James -- a reasonable discount to Chevron's current 9.5 times multiple.
Although the premium is relatively modest, Chevron's shareholders might wonder whether this was the best deal the company could strike, given the wave of distress hitting the energy sector. By some estimates, more than 200 shale companies may file for bankruptcy over the next two years.
Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth stressed Monday morning that quality was important, too. ""Getting bigger isn't necessarily the goal; getting better certainly is important,"" he said on an investor call. Though Noble's shares were down almost 60% year-to-date by Friday, its debt remained investment grade.
Absorbing Noble means Chevron will get additional exposure to the prolific Permian Basin in West Texas, where it had tried to expand last year through Anadarko. The combination also will add acreage in the Eagle Ford in the southern part of Texas and the DJ Basin in Colorado, which Chevron's chief executive said was more mature and therefore less risky compared with other so-called ""unconventional"" assets Chevron owns.
The deal certainly offers immediate perks for Noble Energy shareholders, who will benefit from Chevron's 6% dividend yield, a much more generous number than Noble's 0.8%. Modest synergies aside, the immediate benefit to Chevron's shareholders is less clear, but at a $13 billion enterprise value -- representing 8% of Chevron's market capitalization -- it seems to be a risk they can afford to take."

Chevron Corp. agreed to a deal to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, in what would be the largest oil-patch tie-up since the coronavirus pandemic delivered a shock to the industry.
The all-stock takeover values Noble at $10.38 a share or 0.1191 Chevron share. Chevron said Monday that would represent a roughly 7.6% premium over Noble's Friday closing price of $9.65 and nearly 12% based on a 10-day average. Including Noble's hefty debt load, the deal would be valued at roughly $13 billion.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal was imminent earlier Monday.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that Noble's assets have low operating costs and require little near-term investment, preserving Chevron's ability to navigate global economic uncertainty.
""The downturn in energy prices and demand have put pressure on a lot of different companies in our industry,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""This is an opportunity to bring together two companies and have a stronger company, I think, coming out of it.""
Noble, based in Houston, is an independent oil-and-gas producer with U.S. and international operations. Buying the company would expand Chevron's presence in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Permian Basin, which spans West Texas and New Mexico. It would also give San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, which has a market value of $163 billion, assets in the eastern Mediterranean and West Africa and yield potential annual cost savings of $300 million, according to Chevron.
Noble has about 92,000 acres in the Permian, the largest U.S. oil field, and much of that land is near Chevron's existing assets, according to energy analyst Enverus. Chevron has prioritized the Permian for future investment to increase oil production.
Noble's natural-gas projects in the eastern Mediterranean are also a key component of the deal, say analysts. Those assets will supply natural gas to Israel, Egypt and Jordan, and signal a long-term bet on gas demand by Chevron as countries shift away from coal-powered electric generation, according to Enverus.
Chevron's planned $5 billion purchase is the largest U.S. energy M&A deal in 2020 thus far, according to Dealogic. Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy Dominion Energy Corp.'s natural-gas storage and transmission network for $4 billion, excluding debt.
The Chevron deal for Noble is one of the first signs of life in energy-sector deal-making since oil prices plummeted in March as a result of widespread shutdowns and travel bans. Futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate -- the U.S. bellwether -- briefly entered negative territory in April. While prices have partly recovered and stand at about $40.47 a barrel, the sudden crash sent several energy companies spiraling downward.
More than 20 North American oil producers have filed for bankruptcy this year, according to law firm Haynes & Boone LLP, and dozens more are expected to follow suit if oil prices stay around current levels. Small and midsize oil-and-gas companies have performed poorly in recent years and faced investor pressure to slow growth and deliver more consistent profits and cash flow. That has fed expectations of a potential wave of mergers as stronger players snap up weaker rivals.
Mr. Wirth said investors are clamoring for consolidation, but the industry needs responsible deal-making that can generate returns. Despite a sizable war chest, Mr. Wirth indicated Chevron is unlikely to go on a buying spree in the short-term and is instead focused on an ongoing internal restructuring and integrating Noble. ""This deal positions us to continue to weather an uncertain future and deliver dividends to our shareholders,"" Mr. Wirth said.
Noble is Chevron's first big strategic move after Chevron walked away from a high-profile bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. last year. Chevron was outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp., which paid roughly $38 billion for Anadarko with help from Warren Buffett. Occidental has been languishing under a roughly $40 billion debt load, which it has been taking steps to lessen.
The two rivals had coveted Anadarko's assets in the heart of the oil-rich Permian. After Occidental's offer was deemed superior, Chevron's Mr. Wirth said his company opted to accept the $1 billion termination fee rather than make a higher offer, citing a focus on discipline.
Major oil companies have been eyeing increased acreage in the Permian, partly because its geology makes it one of the least expensive places in the U.S. to produce oil via fracking. Production in the area was booming and helped lift U.S. crude production to record levels before the pandemic shriveled global demand for oil by more than 20% this spring.
Credit Suisse Group AG was the financial adviser to Chevron and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was its legal adviser. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the financial adviser to Noble Energy and Vinson & Elkins LLP was its legal adviser."

Chevron Corp.'s $5 billion all-stock deal to acquire Noble Energy Inc. acts like a hedge against volatile oil prices amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic, the oil major's chief financial officer Pierre Breber said.
""Even in normal times, oil prices move a lot. There is a lot of uncertainty,"" Mr. Breber said in an interview. ""[An all-stock transaction] makes sense at any time, but when you have volatile oil prices and an uncertain economic situation, it makes even more sense.""
San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron on Monday announced it would issue about 58 million in new shares to acquire Noble. Houston-based Noble's shareholders are set to receive 0.1191 Chevron shares for each of their shares, with no cash exchanging hands.
Issuing new equity is attractive to both Chevron and Noble shareholders, Mr. Breber said. Chevron won't take on new debt, as it will simply add to its 1.9 billion of shares already in circulation. And due to the value of Noble's assets, the dilution for existing Chevron shareholders will be limited, analysts said.
""Having equity provides the best value proposition for both the buyer and the seller,"" Mr. Breber said.
Still, as part of the deal, Chevron will be taking on Noble's debt of about $7 billion, Mr. Breber said. Chevron's financial obligations are substantially lower than those of other oil majors, analysts said. The company had net debt of $23.8 billion at the end of the first quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Mr. Breber pointed to Chevron's strong balance sheet, adding that the company has been faring better than some of its competitors. ""We are positioned to be a potential buyer at a reasonable price,"" he said. ""Our resilience in the downside is very well understood by investors.""
Monday's deal is supposed to become accretive within a year after closing, which is expected for the fourth quarter, Mr. Breber said.
Chevron in recent years struck several deals that had equity-components. Its last all-stock deal was its acquisition of Texaco Inc . in 2000, according to a spokesman.
Noble's stock fell from about $37 in May 2018 to a low of approximately $3 in March as global oil markets tumbled amid concerns about the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Noble's share price has recovered but was 70% off its 2018 high on Monday, closing at $10.18.
Chevron's stock has also suffered because of the pandemic, hitting a low of about $54 in late March, down from $121 at the start of the year. The stock has risen in recent months but fell about 2.20% to $85.27 on Monday.
Brent crude was trading at $43.23 on Monday afternoon, up over 127% from its low of about $19 in April.
An all stock-purchase minimizes the risks of the deal in the current environment, said Jason Gabelman, a director at investment bank Cowen Inc. ""This arrangement makes sense given the elevated uncertainty on the commodity outlook as a result of the continuing pandemic,"" Mr. Gabelman said.
Oil prices have increased after a futures contract traded negative in April , but producers expect it will take time for them to return to pre-pandemic levels. ""There is a lot of uncertainty around demand,"" said Sam Margolin, a managing director at Wolfe Research LLC, a research company.

Chevron Corp. agreed to a deal to buy Noble Energy Inc. for about $5 billion, in what would be the largest oil-patch tie-up since the coronavirus pandemic delivered a shock to the industry.
The all-stock takeover values Noble at $10.38 a share or 0.1191 Chevron share. Chevron said Monday that would represent a roughly 7.6% premium over Noble's Friday closing price of $9.65 and nearly 12% based on a 10-day average. Including Noble's hefty debt load, the deal would be valued at roughly $13 billion.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal was imminent earlier Monday.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that Noble's assets have low operating costs and require little near-term investment, preserving Chevron's ability to navigate global economic uncertainty.
""The downturn in energy prices and demand have put pressure on a lot of different companies in our industry,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""This is an opportunity to bring together two companies and have a stronger company, I think, coming out of it.""
Noble, based in Houston, is an independent oil-and-gas producer with U.S. and international operations. Buying the company would expand Chevron's presence in the DJ Basin of Colorado and Permian Basin, which spans West Texas and New Mexico. It would also give San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron, which has a market value of $163 billion, assets in the eastern Mediterranean and West Africa and yield potential annual cost savings of $300 million, according to Chevron.
Noble has about 92,000 acres in the Permian, the largest U.S. oil field, and much of that land is near Chevron's existing assets, according to energy analyst Enverus. Chevron has prioritized the Permian for future investment to increase oil production.
Noble's natural-gas projects in the eastern Mediterranean are also a key component of the deal, say analysts. Those assets will supply natural gas to Israel, Egypt and Jordan, and signal a long-term bet on gas demand by Chevron as countries shift away from coal-powered electric generation, according to Enverus.
Chevron's planned $5 billion purchase is the largest U.S. energy M&A deal in 2020 thus far, according to Dealogic. Earlier this month, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy Dominion Energy Corp.'s natural-gas storage and transmission network for $4 billion, excluding debt.
The Chevron deal for Noble is one of the first signs of life in energy-sector deal-making since oil prices plummeted in March as a result of widespread shutdowns and travel bans. Futures contracts for West Texas Intermediate—the U.S. bellwether—briefly entered negative territory in April. While prices have partly recovered and stand at about $40.47 a barrel, the sudden crash sent several energy companies spiraling downward.
More than 20 North American oil producers have filed for bankruptcy this year, according to law firm Haynes & Boone LLP, and dozens more are expected to follow suit if oil prices stay around current levels.
Small and midsize oil-and-gas companies have performed poorly in recent years and faced investor pressure to slow growth and deliver more consistent profits and cash flow. That has fed expectations of a potential wave of mergers as stronger players snap up weaker rivals.
Mr. Wirth said investors are clamoring for consolidation, but the industry needs responsible deal-making that can generate returns. Despite a sizable war chest, Mr. Wirth indicated Chevron is unlikely to go on a buying spree in the short-term and is instead focused on an ongoing internal restructuring and integrating Noble.
""This deal positions us to continue to weather an uncertain future and deliver dividends to our shareholders,"" Mr. Wirth said.
Noble is Chevron's first big strategic move after walking away from a high-profile bidding war for Anadarko Petroleum Corp. last year. Chevron was outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp., which paid roughly $38 billion for Anadarko with help from Warren Buffett. Occidental has been languishing under a roughly $40 billion debt load, which it has been taking steps to lessen.
The two rivals had coveted Anadarko's assets in the heart of the oil-rich Permian. After Occidental's offer was deemed superior, Chevron's Mr. Wirth said his company opted to accept the $1 billion termination fee rather than make a higher offer, citing a focus on discipline.
Major oil companies have been eyeing increased acreage in the Permian, partly because its geology makes it one of the least expensive places in the U.S. to produce oil via fracking. Production in the area was booming and helped lift U.S. crude production to record levels before the pandemic shriveled global demand for oil by more than 20% this spring.
Credit Suisse Group AG was the financial adviser to Chevron and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP was its legal adviser. JPMorgan Chase & Co. was the financial adviser to Noble Energy and Vinson & Elkins LLP was its legal adviser.

| Jump to first hitIndustry leaders, Keppel Data Centres, Chevron, Pan-United and Surbana Jurong, with the support of the National Research Foundation, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today, committing to harness their combined resources and jointly develop the first end-to-end decarbonisation process in Singapore. This collaboration is aimed at accelerating the development of a highly integrated clean and energy efficient Carbon Capture, Utilisation & Sequestration (CCUS) system that can lead to a low-carbon economy and potential commercial developments for Singapore. Carbon emissions make up 97% of Singapore's total greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Paris Agreement, Singapore has pledged to, by 2030, reduce its emissions intensity by 36% from 2005 levels, and to stabilise its emissions and peak around 2030. The Singapore Government has announced its long-term strategy to halve emissions from its 2030 peak and achieve net-zero emissions as soon as viable. To this end, the partnership will develop CCUS technologies that are readily applicable, with high technical readiness and cost efficiency to implement in Singapore's key industries such as energy, chemicals and construction. Under the MOU, Keppel Data Centres, Chevron, Pan-United and Surbana Jurong will jointly explore, identify and develop mature carbon capture technologies, coupled with novel technologies that utilise cryogens, membranes and hydrogen. The four companies will also leverage the combined resources, knowledge and capabilities with other research partners, Institutes of Higher Learning and international partners to advance the development of the CCUS technologies. When commercially viable, the CCUS technologies are expected to help reduce carbon intensity across the industry sectors and help Singapore reach its goal of net-zero emissions, equivalent to 33 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, by 2050. Mr Thomas Pang, CEO of Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation, the parent company of Keppel Data Centres, said, Keppel is committed to sustainable development and combatting climate change. This MOU augments the different efforts that the Group has taken to reduce the carbon footprint of data centre operations, including exploring floating data centres as well as LNG and hydrogen infrastructure for power generation. The CCUS technologies are scalable and can potentially be implemented in Keppel Data Centre's local and overseas operations, as well as other parts of the Keppel Group, thus contributing to the circular economy and advancing climate action. Chevron shares the society's concerns about climate change. We are committed to advancing technologies and forming strategic partnerships in our efforts to deliver reliable, and ever cleaner energy. I am excited that Chevron will be working with like-minded partners in Singapore to progress polymeric membrane research for carbon capture solutions across various applications and industries. These efforts take us a step further along in Singapore's and the energy industry's long-term, low-emissions development strategy. said Mr Law Tat Win, Chevron Singapore Country Chairman. Ms May Ng, Chief Executive Officer of Pan-United Corporation Ltd, said, Multi-industry collaboration is a key strategy to innovate commercially viable clean technologies that can decarbonise the built environment. I am confident that Pan-United's industry-leading research and development of specialised ready-mix concrete technologies can contribute to this landmark collaboration to combat the adverse effects of climate change. Pan-United is fully focussed on creating concrete solutions in embodied carbon reduction technologies to advance Singapore's sustainability ambitions. Mr Wong Heang Fine, Group Chief Executive Officer of Surbana Jurong said, As a multidisciplinary urban and infrastructure design consultancy, Surbana Jurong is providing step change solutions for sustainability across the project lifecycle. We are actively engaged in R&D to facilitate decarbonisation, focusing on delivering technologies that reduce and eliminate emissions as well as solutions that remove and sequester carbon from the atmosphere. Together with our partners, we are excited about exploring new solutions in carbon capture, use and storage that can scale and be commercially deployed to help us get to a net-zero future. Professor Low Teck Seng, Chief Executive Officer of the National Research Foundation (NRF), said, Investing in low-carbon R&D to drive cost-effective solutions is crucial for Singapore in our journey towards a low-emission economy. While Singapore, like the world, is still dependent on fossil fuels for our energy needs, technologies that enable efficient CCUS would help mitigate our emissions greatly. CCUS also presents opportunities for converting carbon dioxide into novel chemicals, materials and fuels, offering potential in growing new industries. This MOU demonstrates commitment from both industry and researchers to co-develop innovative solutions to achieve Singapore's long-term carbon goals of net-zero emissions.

Chevron Corp. is set to resume oil exports in July from a long-dormant operation it shares with the governments of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, oil officials said Monday.
The expected output surge of roughly 80,000 barrels a day will come as Chevron's partners -- both members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries -- seek to help the cartel curb exports in the aftermath of global pandemic-induced lockdowns that slashed oil demand by about a third.
Oil prices have staged a recovery in recent weeks as pandemic lockdowns ease and drivers return to the roads.
Saudi officials have said they would balance any increased output from the venture with reductions elsewhere. Kuwait's Ministry of Oil didn't respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this month Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, convinced an alliance of 23 producers to extend output cuts of 9.7 million barrels a day by a month until the end of July.
The onshore joint venture, co-owned the two Persian Gulf monarchies and run by Chevron, has been inactive since 2015 because of disputes between the Saudis and Kuwaitis over land-use and environmental permits. Another part of the neighboring field owned by the two countries resumed earlier this year.
The joint venture continues to prepare its operations, a spokeswoman for Chevron said, and ""remains focused on ensuring its workforce is ready to safely resume operational activities."""

By Urvashi ValechaReliance Industries (RIL), India’s most valuable company by market capitalisation, is one of the best performing stocks globally after the market mayhem seen in March. It is among top five companies globally in terms of dollar returns since March 20. According to market experts, there is more value to be unlocked for investors by the oil- to-retail conglomerate. In local currency, RIL’s shares have gained 78.4% in the last 30 trading sessions. The company has contributed to the pull-back rally that the Indian benchmarks witnessed in April. RIL, HDFC Bank and Infosys contributed 58% to the rise in the Sensex from its 52-week low on March 23.RIL has delivered 53.2% returns in dollar terms since March 20 and has added a market cap of $46.35 billion during the same period. The returns are the fifth highest globally after Tesla, T-Mobile US, PayPal Holdings and Chevron Corp. Elon Musk’s Tesla and T-Mobile US have generated dollar returns worth 93.1% and 90.6%, respectively. The dollar returns of PayPal Holdings INC and Chevron Corp stood at 67.4% and 59.7%. This according to market experts shows that RIL has been able to re-align its business model with changing times.Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities, said, “Reliance Industries has managed to achieve this by changing its business model with time and shifted from depending heavily on oil and chemical businesses to depending on the telecom and retail businesses.”In the last three weeks, RIL announced a number of deals, most notably the one with Facebook where the social media giant has agreed to buy a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms, the conglomerate’s subsidiary. After this, US-based private equity firms Silver Lake and Vista Equity Partners announced that they would buy equity stake worth 1.15% and 2.32% in Jio Platforms.Going ahead, RIL is going to open a rights issue on May 14. This according to the street is in line with the management’s vision to make RIL a net debt-free company by fiscal year 2021, which is boosting the sentiment towards the stock and has helped the conglomerate generate superior returns. The general consensus is that there is more value to be unlocked in the stock.Sanjeev Hota, head of research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, said, “There is a lot more value to be unlocked in Reliance digital platform in the coming years. Further, potential value unlocking is also on cards in the Reliance Retail business. In near term, we may have another round of stake sale in Reliance Jio. Overall, we see huge potential for value unlocking in the next two to three years.”RIL was the only Indian and non-American company to feature among the top 10 globally in terms of dollar returns since March 20. Listed entities that generated most returns after RIL were NVIDIA Corp, Home Depot, Broadcom, Facebook - Class A, and Exxon Mobil Corp. The stock of RIL was trading 0.8% higher on the Nifty and closed at Rs 1,575 a piece."

Exxon Mobil Corp. posted its first quarterly loss in three decades as it and rival Chevron Corp. painted a dismal picture of the oil industry, signaling that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic may hang over their businesses for much of 2020.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said Friday the global economic shutdown is putting unprecedented pressure on oil prices. The largest U.S. oil company has cut $10 billion from its planned capital expenditures in 2020, a 30% budget cut.
""We've never seen anything like what the world is facing today,"" Mr. Woods said. ""Bottom line: It's going to be a challenging summer with a pretty sloppy market.""
This time last year, Exxon was reporting first-quarter earnings that topped $2 billion, but in this new world the oil producer sank into the red, with a quarterly loss of $610 million as it took a ""market-related"" $2.9 billion charge. The bulk of the impairment was related to its downstream business, which refines oil into gasoline and other products.
Major oil companies have moved quickly to reduce budgets and production levels as the coronavirus spread globally, gutting demand and sending crude prices plummeting.
Chevron also announced additional budget reductions, saying it would cut capital expenditures by $2 billion on top of the $4 billion it had announced just weeks earlier. Chevron had planned to spend $20 billion in 2020 before the virus took hold but now says it will likely spend $14 billion. It also said it expects operating costs will decrease by $1 billion this year.
""The industry and the world are in a tough place right now,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. ""It feels like we're bumping along a bottom for energy demand when we look at the data. But it doesn't say it's going to snap back.""
The size of the production cuts for each company could have huge consequences, as those that don't have to cut as much could be better positioned to capture rising oil demand as the virus subsides, said Kevin MacCurdy, an analyst for Heikkinen Energy Advisors. ""What's been released so far is just the tip of the iceberg.""
More than 600,000 barrels a day of production cuts have been announced in the U.S., and consulting firm Rystad Energy forecasts that U.S. output will fall from 12.8 million barrels a day in January to 10.9 million a day in June and as low as 10.3 million a day in September. The pandemic has sapped oil demand by as much as 30 million barrels a day, roughly 30%.
Exxon projected that it will reduce production by roughly 400,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, including around 100,000 barrels a day in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
Still, Mr. Woods said the company would continue to invest in projects to increase future oil production. Exxon's oil output was up slightly in the quarter, thanks to 9% increases in two of its key projects: Guyana and the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field.
Chevron reported $3.6 billion in profit for the first quarter, up 36% from the year-earlier period, but said it expects financial results to fall later in the year due to the pandemic-led oil-price crash.
The company projected it would reduce output by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day in May, and 200,000 to 400,000 in June.
While Exxon and Chevron are cutting hundreds of thousands of barrels in the short-term, the volumes are proportionally smaller compared with what smaller companies are being forced to cut. Exxon's planned cuts amount to about 10% of its global oil production. By contrast, some smaller shale companies are cutting 50% or more of their production.
Earnings from Chevron's oil and gas production are already under pressure, falling to $241 million from $748 million during the period last year. The company said it fetched $37 for a barrel of oil during the quarter, down from $48 a year earlier. Overall production of oil and equivalent liquids increased by 180,000 barrels a day from last year.
Exxon shares fell 7.2% on Friday while Chevron edged down 2.8% on the results.
Earlier this week, Royal Dutch Shell PLC cut its dividend for the first time since World War II, upending what has long been a fundamental bargain between oil majors and their investors, who count on steady payments from the companies.
On Wednesday, Exxon signaled it may break its decadeslong run of annual dividend increases, saying it would maintain current levels in the second quarter. Chevron and BP PLC also didn't increase their dividends.
BP reported a $4.3 billion loss for the first quarter as its debt climbed to its highest levels since 2015, while Shell reported a $24 million loss.
For years, Exxon and Chevron have prioritized investing in dividend increases and growing oil production. Those priorities are now stressing their balance sheets, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank estimates Exxon and Chevron will have added $53 billion and $29 billion, respectively, between 2010 and the end of this year, and said they should re-evaluate their capital allocation policies.
Chevron is among a group of companies that are negotiating production cuts with oil-rich nations that have agreed to reduce production. Russia, Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in April to cut global output by 13%, or about 13 million barrels a day. About 15% of Chevron's oil-equivalent production in 2019 occurred in the OPEC members of Angola, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo and Venezuela.
""We're not immune to some of these realities,"" Mr. Wirth said. Despite the cuts, Mr. Wirth said he expected Chevron's annual production to be roughly flat from last year, including in the Permian."

The bank estimates Exxon and Chevron will have added $53 billion and $29 billion, respectively, between 2010 and the end of this year, and said they should re-evaluate their capital allocation policies.
While the first-quarter results were painful for the companies, many analysts believe the next quarter could be even worse as the full impact of the economic shutdown becomes clearer.
""I think the most likely scenario we see is things get a lot worse before they get better,"" said Dan Pickering, founder of energy-focused asset management firm Pickering Energy Partners.
Some are hoping the silver lining is that the virus spurs a much-needed wave of consolidation in the U.S. oil industry, as analysts predict there will be dozens if not hundreds of bankruptcies. Exxon and Chevron could stand to benefit if they are able to swoop in to buy companies that emerge vulnerable following the crisis.
""We're certainly going to come out of this with a lot less companies, and probably more diverse companies,"" said George R. Ward, head of investment bank PJ Solomon's energy group.

The world's largest energy companies are negotiating production cuts with oil-rich nations ahead of Friday's deadline for OPEC and the Group of 20 countries to sharply reduce output—reductions that will limit these firms' options for coping with the crude-price rout.
Earlier in April, Saudi Arabia and Russia ended a price war and joined forces with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil-producing nations,
agreeing to cut global output
by 13% or about 13 million barrels a day. Big oil companies that produce in these countries, including BP PLC, Chevron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, will have to shoulder some of those cuts.
Nigeria has reached out to Chevron and Shell, according to Nigerian oil officials. Oman has ordered Occidental to reduce its production at each of its fields by a total of 58,000 barrels a day.
BP has been asked to reduce production in locations including the Middle East, Angola and Azerbaijan. The company said it hasn't fully shut production at any of its businesses, but was looking at how specific fields and exports would be affected.
""We are working through that level of detail right now—and of course the first of May [the deadline for countries' production cuts] is approaching very, very quickly,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said Tuesday.
He added that Russia was taking steps to reduce output in line with the deal. BP has a 20% stake in Russia's top producer, Rosneft Oil Co.
The oil-reduction pledge follows a 50% decline in crude prices over the last eight weeks, resulting from the combined impact of the Saudi-Russia price war and a collapse in demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
BP, the first oil major to report quarterly earnings for this year, said
its debt had increased
and signaled a negative outlook for the April-June period, underscoring the early impact of the rout on the industry.
Shell said Thursday it
expected its oil and gas production to fall
to between 1.75 million and 2.25 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the second quarter from 2.7 million barrels a day in the first quarter. The company said it saw 40% of the drop resulting from the OPEC-led cuts.
CEO Ben van Beurden said Shell had been ""approached by counterparties—national oil companies, governments—who in the OPEC-plus setting have committed to curtailments."" He said the company must navigate between demands from these governments and the need to respect antitrust provisions.
Algeria, the United Arab Emirates and Kazakhstan have also reached out to foreign oil companies regarding plans to reduce production, officials in these countries and other people familiar with the matter said this week. Chevron, Eni SpA, Occidental, Shell and France's Total SA are among the companies operating in these nations, including through joint ventures.
Norway said late Wednesday it would curtail production by 250,000 barrels a day in June—the first country outside the OPEC-plus alliance to announce compulsory curbs. The decision is set to affect Equinor ASA—the Scandinavian country's national oil champion—along with Total, Shell and ConocoPhillips.
Chevron said its 50%-owned venture in Kazakhstan, Tengizchevroil, ""continues to produce according to the business plan."" In Nigeria, the U.S. company said it was working with its partners to ""explore ways of reducing costs and adjusting production.""

U.S., Saudi Arabia, Russia Lead Pact for Record Cuts in Oil Output

Eni, Occidental and Total declined to comment.
Nigeria reduced its output by 417,000 barrels a day in April, ahead of the pact's start date, and some wells have shut, said the West African country's oil minister, Timipre Sylva.
American companies are being forced to shut down wells in costly shale reservoirs in the U.S. where they have focused in recent years.
About 27% of Occidental's output is outside the U.S., while around 15% of Chevron's oil-equivalent production in 2019 occurred in the OPEC members of Angola, Nigeria, the Republic of Congo and Venezuela. The company also has substantial exposure to Kazakhstan.
European oil companies are even more exposed. About half of the annual barrels BP pumps come from Africa and Asia—where most major producing-countries have joined the 23-nation OPEC-plus alliance. Italy's Eni and Total derive 75% and 68% of their oil production, respectively, from these two continents.
While the OPEC-plus effort may put a floor under plummeting oil prices, it also means some companies will have to make cuts in addition to those planned. Last week, Eni said the move could add more curbs to its already downgraded production plans for this year.
Price collapses often prompt energy companies to cut output from locations where production costs are highest. Suncor Energy Inc. and Total, for instance, recently cut production at their jointly held Canadian oil sands mine in northern Alberta.
OPEC members, where production costs are among the lowest in the world, aren't necessarily where they would choose to cut back.
""If you happen to be in the Middle East, unfortunately that is lower-cost oil production that you may be forced to shut by the government,"" said Irene Himona, managing director for oil-and-gas equity research at Société Générale.

Chevron Corp. is cutting $4 billion from its capital budget as it confronts plummeting petroleum demand and an oil-price rout, the latest major energy company to axe its spending to shore up its balance sheet.
The oil giant said Tuesday it would reduce its 2020 spending by 20% to about $16 billion, with the biggest cut to come in the largest U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.
Chevron will also suspend stock buybacks but promised to protect its dividend and said oil production would be flat.
Chief Executive Mike Wirth said the dual shock of the oil demand-sapping coronavirus pandemic and an increase in supply due to the oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia necessitated drastic measures.
""To see these two things happen simultaneously is really unprecedented,"" Mr. Wirth said in an interview. ""We can't control that, but we're focused on making the moves that will preserve the strength of our company.""
Chevron's announcement follows similar austerity measures by its peers and other large industrial companies.
On Monday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC halted its $25 billion share-buyback program and cut its capital expenditures by 20% in 2020 to $20 billion from $25 billion.
Total SA said Monday it planned to trim spending by $3 billion, halt $2 billion in buybacks and borrow $4 billion to make up for a $9 billion shortfall created by low oil prices.
ExxonMobil Corp. said last week it planned to make significant cuts to its spending.
The industry faces its biggest challenge in decades.
Analytics firm IHS Markit forecast the largest-ever glut of oil this year if current market dynamics continue.
Globally, there could be as much as 10 million barrels a day of oil in excess of demand for the next several months, the firm said.
U.S. producers would be among the hardest hit, cutting as much as 4 million barrels a day of production during the next 18 months, it said.
Such a pullback would have dramatic consequences for the economies of oil-rich states, including Texas and North Dakota, where the industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Chevron said it would cut $2 billion from shale drilling, primarily in the Permian Basin, which will result in 20% lower oil production there than Chevron previously forecast.
Such cuts would likely lead to layoffs at Chevron. Mr. Wirth said Chevron had already planned reductions to its workforce before the virus took hold.
""That remains the reality today,"" he said.
Chevron's priority is maintaining its dividend, which Mr. Wirth said it hadn't cut since the Great Depression nearly a century ago.
The company can pay the dividend from its cash flow at current oil prices but cannot also cover its capital expenditures, he said.
If oil prices remain below $30 a barrel, the company would draw on its balance sheet to cover both, according to Mr. Wirth.
""We may need to lean on the balance sheet if prices remain in that range, which is why we have it,"" he said."

Chevron Corp.'s chief financial officer is resorting to a tested playbook that involves slashing capital expenditures and reducing costs to respond to a sharp decline in oil prices and lower petroleum demand.
""It's obviously more extreme than we expected,"" Chevron CFO Pierre Breber said in an interview.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based oil giant Tuesday said it would
cut $4 billion
in capital expenditures amid lower oil consumption caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the continuing oil price-war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Oil prices have fallen more than half since the beginning of the year to around $30 a barrel.
Chevron said it would reduce its 2020 spending by around 20% to about $16 billion, with deep cuts to its Permian Basin project in West Texas and New Mexico. Chevron said it also would suspend share buybacks but pledged to keep its dividend.
There will be additional cuts to operational costs associated with capital programs, said Mr. Breber, a company veteran
who took over
Chevron's finance function last April.
Mr. Breber said his response to the coronavirus pandemic focuses on preserving short-term cash, managing liquidity and protecting the dividend, a set of actions that mirror those taken by the company in response to the 2008 financial crisis and the 2014 oil-price drop.
Chevron significantly
cut staff
during both periods, and in the latter case,
reduced capital spending
.
Mr. Breber said he talked to predecessors Patricia Yarrington, who ran Chevron's finances from 2009 to 2019, and Steve Crowe, who served as CFO before Ms. Yarrington, to discuss Chevron's response to the steep decline in oil prices in recent weeks.
Chevron has more flexibility than during previous crises to reduce production and cut spending, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research Co. ""Back in 2008, 2009, the Permian Basin was not a big deal,"" Mr. Selesky said. ""Today it is—and they can turn it on and off depending on where the oil price sits.""
S&P Global Inc. on Monday forecast Brent oil to average $30 a barrel for the remainder of the year and West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil-price benchmark, to stay at around $25 a barrel.
""We don't know exactly what's going to happen in the short term, but we have to prepare for what looks like much lower demand in the short term and more supply,"" Mr. Breber said.
Chevron earlier this year presented a five-year outlook based on an average price of $60 a barrel for Brent. Even though the assumptions have changed, it helps to have a long-term framework, Mr. Breber said. ""It's fundamentally looking at a medium-term financial framework where you're looking for cash balance,"" he said.
The company likely will observe how the market develops in the next few months before making more cost-cutting moves, said Jason Gabelman, an analyst at Cowen & Co. ""I don't think that you want to do too much too fast because those decisions could ultimately be incorrect if the market turns on you and then you've become less efficient,"" he said.
Chevron's move follows similar actions by other oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp. Total, for example, said it plans to
cut $3 billion in spending
, borrow $4 billion and suspend $2 billion in share buybacks.

Can new technology suck carbon dioxide, a prevalent greenhouse gas, out of the air—economically? More companies are betting that it can, as governments adopt ambitious carbon-emissions targets and investors
grow increasingly concerned about the risks of climate change
.
Carbon-capture
techniques have existed
for decades. But it's incredibly expensive—not to mention energy intensive—to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on a large enough scale to make a significant dent.
Now, Exxon Mobil Corp., Microsoft Corp. and others are focused on reducing the cost and the amount of energy required to capture carbon dioxide. Some companies are using giant fans to suck up air, then separating the carbon dioxide chemically. One venture plans to fill land in Arizona with dozens of accordionlike machines designed to expand as they absorb the gas.
Carbon-capture technology works similarly to plant photosynthesis in that it takes in carbon dioxide. But rather than producing oxygen or carbohydrates, as plants do, the equipment removes carbon dioxide from exhaust, ambient air or other gas streams, and then concentrates the molecule so that it can be stored underground, repurposed to make fuels or even used to carbonate drinks. 





Fans developed by Climeworks suck air into containers roughly the size of small cars, where filters remove the carbon dioxide. PHOTO: Mattia Balsamini for The Wall Street Journal
Among those leading the charge are major oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., Chevron Corp. and Exxon, whose fuels contribute to global warming. Carbon dioxide traps heat, and most domestic emissions of the gas come from burning fossil fuels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Many oil producers are investing in capture technology because they have an economic purpose for the gas: They inject it deep underground to help release trapped oil. Known as enhanced oil recovery, this process is the top use for captured carbon dioxide globally, according to an analysis of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities by the Global CCS Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for the technology.
Many companies expect there will be more reasons to buy and sell the molecule in the coming decades, though that likely will depend on lawmakers taking additional steps to regulate emissions, such as by putting a price on carbon.

""Part of this has to be economic,"" says Robert Peterson, a senior vice president for Houston-based Occidental, a leader in enhanced oil recovery.
Occidental gets nearly all of the carbon dioxide it injects underground from naturally occurring carbon-dioxide reservoirs. But in the future the company wants captured carbon to play a larger role so that it can take advantage of federal tax incentives, help meet corporate environmental targets and eventually market its fuels as low-carbon.
To do so, Occidental has joined with Canadian firm Carbon Engineering Ltd. to build a facility in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico that would take up to roughly 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere annually. That's equivalent to the greenhouse-gas emissions from more than 200,000 cars a year, according to EPA estimates.
Carbon Engineering plans to start construction next year and open the plant in 2023. It would be the world's largest facility designed to remove carbon dioxide from the ambient air, according to the Global CCS Institute, relying on industrial fans to bring air into contact with a liquid solution that binds to the greenhouse gas. Existing large capture plants suck up the gas where it's more concentrated, such as at natural-gas processing plants.
Carbon Engineering declined to provide a cost estimate for the facility.
Some find the practice of capturing carbon to augment oil production troubling. ""We see at least a strong danger of a moral hazard here,"" says Jan Wurzbacher, chief executive of Swiss carbon-capture firm Climeworks AG, which doesn't sell its carbon dioxide to oil companies. ""Will it just allow us to emit more fossil fuels?""
Climeworks clients include a Swiss greenhouse that uses the gas to help plants grow bigger; Coca-Cola HBC Switzerland, which uses the carbon dioxide to make seltzer; and even individuals who want to offset their carbon footprint by paying to bury the gas that Climeworks captures. At its facility in Hinwil, a village in Switzerland, fans suck air into containers roughly the size of small cars, where filters remove the carbon dioxide.
Carbon capture isn't cheap. If current technology were implemented at scale, it would cost between about $80 and $160 a metric ton to capture and store the carbon dioxide produced by natural-gas power plants, and between about $125 and $449 a metric ton to take the gas out of the ambient air, where it's more diffuse, according to Goldman Sachs estimates.
In the U.S.—which generated roughly 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2017, EPA data show—the tax credit for capturing and storing carbon dioxide was less than $30 a metric ton as of 2019, though that is set to increase to as much as $50 in the coming years.
Globally, the highest price on carbon as of last year was about $121 a metric ton, in Sweden, according to the World Bank.
""Ultimately this is a waste-management problem,"" says Arizona State University engineering professor Klaus Lackner, who developed the accordionlike machine. ""Any carbon-based fuel that you combust will produce CO2, and if you put that in the atmosphere, it becomes your responsibility to take it out.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Can carbon-capture technologies contribute meaningfully to efforts to slow climate change? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.

Mr. Lackner calls his machines ""mechanical trees"" for their ability to filter carbon dioxide from the ambient air. One version of the device is about 5 feet wide and can expand to about 30 feet tall, exposing specialized disks that bind to carbon dioxide molecules. When the disks get wet, the carbon is released and can be collected.
Silicon Kingdom Holdings Ltd., an Irish company with ties to ASU, plans to commercialize the technology, and sell the carbon dioxide and potentially carbon credits or offsets, if those markets take off. It plans to install a dozen of the devices in the Phoenix area this year and eventually build a 360-unit farm in the state.
Powering carbon-capture equipment also typically consumes a lot of energy, potentially undercutting the climate benefits. Generally, researchers have assumed that for every 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity a power plant produces, an additional 25 kilowatt-hours are needed to collect the associated carbon dioxide emissions, according to Stanford University engineering professor Mark Jacobson. However, Mr. Jacobson's research indicates that figure can be as high as about 50 kilowatt-hours.

""There's really no case ever where carbon capture is better than just taking renewable energy and replacing a coal or gas plant,"" says Mr. Jacobson, who has studied the health and climate effects of carbon-dioxide removal.
Microsoft last month pledged to invest $1 billion over the next four years in the development of carbon-removal and reduction technology as part of a climate initiative that would have the technology company become ""carbon negative"" by 2030.
Exxon also is working to address some of those issues by joining with Connecticut-based FuelCell Energy Inc. to develop technology that would remove carbon dioxide from industrial exhaust electrochemically while also converting natural gas to electricity.
Chevron has invested in companies that are fine-tuning how to capture the greenhouse gas more efficiently. Among them are Carbon Engineering and Svante Inc., a Canadian firm whose filters extract the carbon dioxide produced from industrial processes such as burning natural gas or making cement.
Chevron also operates one of the world's largest projects to bury carbon dioxide, in Australia, which the government required Chevron to build as part of a natural-gas development there. In that case, however, Chevron isn't taking carbon dioxide out of the air. Instead, it separates the molecule from natural gas as it flows from underground.
""The demand for energy is growing, and the expectations to lower the carbon footprint are increasing,"" says Barbara Burger, president of Chevron's venture-capital arm.

Amazon.com Inc.
Amazon.com said in a legal filing that President Trump
exerted ""improper pressure""
on the Defense Department to keep a lucrative cloud-computing deal from going to company founder Jeffrey Bezos, a sign of how significant the stakes are in the multibillion-dollar cloud business. Amazon.com is protesting the awarding of the $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract to Microsoft Corp. in October. Amazon shares fell 0.1% Monday.
PG&E Corp.
PG&E has reached a settlement with
California wildfire victims
. The $13.5 billion settlement removes a significant obstacle to its emergence from chapter 11 protection. The bankrupt utility company bowed to demands for more money for fire victims and gave in to pressure from California Gov. Gavin Newsom to improve its corporate governance and implement stricter safety protocols. Under the settlement, PG&E will pay half of the $13.5 billion in cash and half in stock, an important concession to fire victims who were concerned the utility's stock could be a risky bet. PG&E shares gained 16% Monday, the first trading day after the settlement.
NortonLifeLock Inc.
Lots of companies would like the keys to this seller of identify-theft protection and antivirus software. The $16 billion NortonLifeLock
has attracted deal interest from a handful of potential suitors
including rival McAfee LLC, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. The consumer-software firm was once known as Symantec Corp. and changed its name after closing a $10.7 billion deal to sell its enterprise-security business to Broadcom Inc. in early November. Permira and Advent International Corp. also proposed a takeover before the Broadcom deal closed. NortonLifeLock shares gained 3.5% Tuesday.
Chevron Corp.
One of the world's biggest energy producers is making a big concession: In an age of abundant oil and gas some of its holdings won't be profitable anytime soon. Chevron said Tuesday
it wrote down the value of a number of properties
, notably its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia, by a combined $10 billion to $11 billion. Chevron is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of persistently low natural gas prices, and will explore sales of some assets. Chevron shares fell 1.4% Wednesday.
Lululemon Athletica Inc.
Lululemon wants to
test how far men will stretch
. After building its brand by convincing women to wear its pricey yoga pants outside of the gym, the company says its most promising customers now are men. On Wednesday, Lululemon Chief Executive Calvin McDonald said total revenue for men's apparel grew 38% in the third quarter and reiterated the company's goal of doubling the men's business by the end of 2023. As Lululemon seek to expand that business, the company hopes to persuade male shoppers that its pants are worth a price tag approaching $200 for the costliest pair. Shares fell 3.7% Thursday.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV
Peace in the New Year. That's what the United Auto Workers agreed to Wednesday when
it secured a new four-year contract
with Fiat Chrysler. The ratification is the last of three deals negotiated this year by UAW, closing a grueling round of labor negotiations for UAW leaders. The union now has new contracts in hand at Fiat Chrysler, General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. The new deal with Fiat Chrysler includes terms that will likely close a longstanding labor-cost gap between the Italian-American car company and its larger rivals, labor experts say. Fiat Chrysler shares added 2.6% Thursday.
Broadcom Inc.
A limited trade deal between the U.S. and China announced Friday didn't immediately help Broadcom, which has struggled amid the ongoing trade war. Shares fell 3.8% Friday. The chip maker posted
weaker fourth-quarter figures late Thursday
, dented by the U.S. export ban of some items to Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. Huawei accounted for about $900 million of Broadcom's sales in its previous fiscal year. Still, Chief Executive Hock Tan said he expects the company's semiconductor business to bounce back later in the fiscal year.

| Jump to first hitChevron Corp. is considering putting its entire stake in the proposed liquid natural gas project in British Columbia on the block, in a blow to Canada's aspirations to build a robust LNG industry.
""Although Kitimat LNG is a globally competitive LNG project, the strength of Chevron Corporation's global portfolio of investment opportunities is such that the Kitimat LNG Project will not be funded by Chevron and may be of higher value to another company,"" the company said on Tuesday.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based company said its Canadian unit will look for buyers for its 50-per-cent interest in the Kitimat LNG Project, but set no timeline to conclude the process. Chevron's other Canadian projects are not part of the sale.
The company said it would continue to work closely with its joint venture partner Woodside Petroleum Ltd, which owns the other half of the company, and First Nations partners during the process.
Chevron's comments have dented some of the optimism in the Canadian natural gas sector, which had cheered the construction of the $40-billion, Royal Dutch Shell Plcled LNG Canada project and the prospect of Pacific Oil and Gas Ltd.'s smaller Woodfibre LNG project.

| Jump to first hitChevron Corp. is considering putting its entire stake in the proposed liquid natural gas project in British Columbia on the block, in a blow to Canada's aspirations to build a robust LNG industry.
""Although Kitimat LNG is a globally competitive LNG project, the strength of Chevron Corporation's global portfolio of investment opportunities is such that the Kitimat LNG Project will not be funded by Chevron and may be of higher value to another company,"" the company said on Tuesday.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based company said its Canadian unit will look for buyers for its 50 per cent interest in the Kitimat LNG Project, but set no timeline to conclude the process. Chevron's other Canadian projects are not part of the sale.
The company said it would continue to work closely with its joint venture partner Woodside Petroleum Ltd, which owns the other half of the company, and First Nations partners during the process.
Chevron's comments have dented some of the optimism in the Canadian natural gas sector, which had cheered the construction of the $40-billion, Royal Dutch Shell PLC-led LNG Canada project and the prospect of Pacific Oil and Gas Ltd.'s smaller Woodfibre LNG project.
""It would have been nice to LNG facilities come onstream shortly after (Shell's) LNG Canada, but the comments that Chevron made yesterday may be tempering this type of enthusiasm,"" Raymond James analyst Jeremy McCrea said, adding the comments were surprising given how Chevron had been advancing the Kitimat LNG project.
""To see them potentially take the writedown on their gas reserves and make the comments they did is a bit of a reversal from what we've seen from them,"" he said, adding the company might be ""taking a pause"" given the outlook for global LNG prices.
Asked whether there was an obvious buyer for the Chevron's stake in the project, which it co-owns with Woodside, McCrea said ""nobody comes to mind,"" but noted that groups like Rockies LNG have been actively looking to build a project.
Rockies LNG, a consortium of B.C. and Alberta natural gas producers, did not respond to a request for comment.
The LNG project, which Chevron had committed to operate, features upstream resource assets in the Liard and Horn River Basins in northeast B.C., a 471-kilometre Pacific Trail Pipeline and a natural gas liquefaction facility at Bish Cove near Kitimat.
The proposed project envisions three LNG trains with a combined capacity of 18 million tonnes per annum powered by hydroelectricity from BC Hydro.
The move to sell the Kitimat project come as Chevron took an axe to its balance sheet Tuesday and wrote down the value of its assets by US$10 billion to $11 billion this quarter, related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico project and shale gas in Appalachia.
The company said it will hold its 2020 global spending program flat at US$20 billion.
""With capital discipline and a conservative outlook comes the responsibility to make the tough choices necessary to deliver higher cash returns to our shareholders over the long term,"" chief executive Michael Wirth said.
Wirth is preparing sweeping changes that would cut costs and streamline operations with expectations of lower-for-longer commodity prices.
Morgan Stanley expects natural gas prices to worsen next year, amid oversupply.
""To solve this glut, we see increasing risk of U.S. LNG export capacity shutins next summer,"" the Wall Street bank said in a note to clients on Wednesday. ""We are cutting our 2020 Henry Hub price forecast from US$2.50/MMBtu to US$2.25/MMBtu, though maintain long-term estimate of US$2.50/MMBtu.""

| Jump to first hitOil and gas producers could wipe billions of dollars more off the value of U.S. natural gas assets in the months ahead, analysts said on Wednesday, after Chevron Corp. became the fourth oil major to slash its estimates for sector values.
A long, steady increase in U.S. gas production - much of it a byproduct of the shale oil boom - has pushed prices for gas toward a 25-year low.
In response, BP PLC, Repsol SA and Equinor ASA have already written off more than US$11 billion in total from the value of North American shale assets just this year.
Industry players, consultants and analysts all said the move by Chevron was a sign that much more was to come, with one brokerage highlighting exposure for Exxon Mobil Corp. ""Chevron writing down assets - especially of this magnitude - isn't just symbolic, it's indicative of what's to come with impairment testing across the entire U.S. exploration and production space,"" said Dallas Salazar, head of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.
Mizuho Securities analysts urged Exxon CEO Darren Woods to write down the full value of its US$30-billion acquisition of XTO Energy. Exxon bought XTO in 2009 and booked a US$2-billion charge in 2017 against the value of natural gas reserves from the buyout. Exxon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
Chevron on Tuesday said it expects to take writedowns to the tune of US$10 billion to US$11 billion in the fourth quarter, more than half of which is related to its Appalachia gas shale assets.
The write-downs are broadly the result of assuming much higher future prices for natural gas.
Shell, for example, said in its 2018 annual report that it expected prices would rise to US$3.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2020 and 2021 from US$3.25 per MMBtu in 2019. BP said it had determined the size of its recoverable reserves based on a long-term price of US$4 per MMBtu.
Natural gas has been below US$2.70 for most of this year and currently stands around US$2.28. IHS Markit projects U.S. gas prices will average below US$2 per MMBtu next year, the lowest prices since 1995. The low prices are caused by the huge output in the Permian in Texas and New Mexico.
""The real story is the associated gas that's being produced out of the Permian. It puts a lot of pressure on organic development of natural gas,"" said Ben Cook, portfolio manager with BP Capital Fund Advisors LLC.
Artem Abramov at consultancy Rystad Energy singled out producers in Pennsylvania's Appalachian basin, which he said would have to make ""material"" writedowns.

Shares of oil and gas producers dropped after Chevron Corp. wrote down the value of its assets by more than $10 billion and lowered its forecast for commodity prices.
Chevron's move marked a concession that some of its holdings wouldn't be profitable soon as it slashed the value of properties like its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia.
A global glut and mounting worries about demand for fossil fuels have weighed on energy prices and shares of producers recently.
Natural-gas prices have sunk since Chevron bought acreage in Appalachia. The price of natural gas is down roughly 46% over the past year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Chevron stock slipped $1.66, or 1.4%, to $116.23. Shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp. lost 3.9%. Range Resources Corp. fell about 1.5%.
Meanwhile, several stock analysts revised their price targets for Chevron shares lower, FactSet data show.
The shares have already lagged behind the S&P 500 this year, gaining 6.8% -- well behind the broader stock index's 25% advance.
Energy companies within the S&P 500 have been the worst performers of the stock index's 11 groups.
Analysts have also lowered their price forecasts on Antero Resources Corp., which focuses on developing and buying natural gas in the Appalachian Basin.
They also dropped their targets for Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., which fell 1.2% Wednesday.
Natural-gas prices have dwindled as supply has outpaced demand, leading oil-and-gas companies to dial back on drilling this year.
EQT Corp. said this year that it would spend less on drilling in 2019 than it did last year.

Chevron Corp. is writing down the value of its assets by more than $10 billion, a concession that in an age of abundant oil and gas, some of its holdings won't be profitable anytime soon.
In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, Chevron said Tuesday that it was cutting the value of a number of properties, notably its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia, by a combined $10 billion to $11 billion. Chevron is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of low natural gas prices, and will explore sales of some assets.
The second-largest U.S. oil company lowered its forecast for future commodity prices, and said that as a result, it was reducing the value of production from one of its offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico. It also lowered the value of a planned facility to export liquefied natural gas from Canada.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that the company had performed well in a difficult market but wanted to focus on its most promising future prospects, including expanded shale oil drilling in Texas.
""We have to make the tough choices to high-grade our portfolio and invest in the highest-return projects in the world we see ahead of us, and that's a different world than the one that lies behind us,"" Mr. Wirth said.
Chevron's shares closed up less than a percentage point at $117.90 prior to the announcement. Reaction was muted in after-hours trading.
The reappraisal by Chevron is likely to ripple through the industry, forcing others to reassess their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long-term future of fossil fuels.
Chevron's move follows a $5 billion write-down by Spain's Repsol SA earlier this month and an impairment of $2.6 billion by the U.K.'s BP PLC in October. Industry executives and analysts anticipate that many more oil-and-gas companies will soon write down billions in value to comply with accounting standards.
Many companies are also expected to substantially reduce the value of their oil and gas reserves, figures once seen as essential measures of their long-term security, under separate reporting requirements governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission amid uncertainty over whether the fossil fuels can be cost-effectively extracted. Chevron might restate its reserves to the SEC after any asset sales, a company executive said.
""As the data gets more compelling, they have to face it,"" said Myron Boots, co-founder of reservoir engineering consulting firm Buckley & Boots LLC, noting that many wells have failed to live up to expectations.
Exxon Mobil Corp. has written down its U.S. natural gas assets by about $2.5 billion over the last several years. Some analysts have said it should further devalue its largest shale asset, XTO Energy Inc., which it bought for more than $30 billion in 2010. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on Chevron's decision Tuesday, noting that it is difficult to compare write-offs across different companies.
A flood of oil and gas unlocked by the U.S. shale boom has led to low commodity prices and eaten into fossil fuel companies' profits. The techniques behind the boom, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have upended global markets, Mr. Wirth said. ""They have truly transformed the market mind-set from one of scarcity to one of abundance.""
Russia and OPEC have been curtailing oil production for years to put a floor under global prices and agreed last week to further cuts of 500,000 barrels a day until the end of March. Still, oil companies are falling out of favor with investors amid fears that electric vehicles and renewable energy, along with government regulations to address a warming planet, will constrain them. Oil-and-gas companies now make up about 4% of the S&P 500 index, down from roughly 10% a decade ago, FactSet data show.
Chevron has scaled back its footprint. It operates in around 18 countries, according to the company, down from nearly 40 earlier this decade. Mr. Wirth said Chevron must be selective about its investments moving forward, focusing on oil-rich regions like the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico.
Chevron made a big bet on natural gas in 2010, when it acquired Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion and assumed $1.1 billion of the Appalachian producer's debt. At the time, gas prices had tumbled 21% to about $4.21 per million British thermal units. On Tuesday afternoon, prior to Chevron's announcement, prices were roughly $2.26 per MMBtu.

The second-largest U.S. oil company lowered its forecast for future commodity prices, and said that as a result, it was reducing the value of production from one of its offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico,
called Big Foot
. It also lowered the value of a planned facility to export liquefied natural gas from Canada.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that the company had performed well in a difficult market but wanted to focus on its most promising future prospects, including an expansion of shale oil drilling in Texas.

The sobering reappraisal by Chevron, one of the world's largest and best-performing oil companies, is likely to ripple through the oil-and-gas industry, forcing others to publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut
and growing investor concerns
about the long-term future of fossil fuels. Particular pressure is falling on shale producers, especially those focused on natural gas in places like Pennsylvania, which are struggling with historically low U.S. prices caused by oversupply.
Chevron's move follows a $5 billion write-down by Spain's Repsol SA earlier this month and
an impairment of $2.6 billion
by the U.K.'s BP PLC in October. Industry executives and analysts anticipate that many more oil-and-gas companies will soon write down billions in value to comply with accounting standards because low commodity prices have undermined the economics of many projects.

Only 20 years ago, the oil-and-gas industry was worried about running out of fossil fuels and scoured the world for reserves. Today, it faces a different problem: too much oil and gas.
An abundance of discoveries over the last decade, particularly the flood of oil and gas unlocked by the U.S. shale boom, has led to consistently low commodity prices and eaten into fossil fuel companies' profits. The techniques behind the boom, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have upended global markets, Mr. Wirth said.
""They have truly transformed the market mind-set from one of scarcity to one of abundance,"" he said. ""It's the story of our industry.""
Russia and OPEC have been curtailing oil production for years to put a floor under global prices and
agreed last week to further cuts
of 500,000 barrels a day until the end of March. Still, oil companies have struggled to reap the profits of old and are falling out of favor with investors amid fears that electric vehicles and renewable energy, along with government regulations to address a warming planet,
will constrain their futures
. Oil-and-gas companies now make up about 4% of the S&P 500 index, down from roughly 10% a decade ago, FactSet data show.
Amid the changing landscape, Chevron has pulled back on its global footprint. It now operates in around 18 countries, according to the company, down from nearly 40 earlier this decade. Mr. Wirth said Chevron must be selective about its investments moving forward, focusing on oil-rich regions like
the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico
.
The company is also undertaking a restructuring, going from four global production units to three. ""Companies that wait until change is forced upon them fail,"" Mr. Wirth said in a video sent to employees last week. ""We're not going to let that happen at Chevron.""
Some of the layoffs are likely to come from the company's unit in Appalachia. The company is exploring a sale or strategic alternatives for those assets and the Kitimat LNG project in Canada, one of the projects included in the write-down.

Chevron made a big bet on natural gas
in 2010, when it acquired Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion and assumed $1.1 billion of the Appalachian producer's debt. At the time, gas prices had tumbled 21% to about $4.21 per million British thermal units. Chevron upped its wager in 2011 with
more acquisitions in the region
through private transactions that analysts valued at about $1.6 billion at the time.
Those bets look misguided today. On Tuesday afternoon, prior to Chevron's announcement, natural gas prices were roughly $2.26 per MMBtu, up about 1.4% on the day.
Over the past decade, frackers helped release a gusher of gas that has driven down costs for consumers. But the amount of natural gas produced in the U.S. has exceeded U.S. consumption since 2017, Energy Information Administration data show. Gas prices are expected to continue falling, to an average of about $2 per MMBtu, next year, according to analytics firm IHS Markit.
The result has been prolonged hardship for U.S. gas drillers and their investors. That is expected to last well into the next decade, particularly for companies focused on the Appalachian region, which contains much gas but little oil.
Chevron is one of the largest leaseholders in Appalachia but only the 18th largest producer there, according to energy consulting firm Rystad Energy, and has fared better than many of its competitors.
Mr. Wirth said that while some natural gas projects have become uneconomic, the fuel remains an important part of Chevron's strategy.
""The world runs on oil and gas today and any energy transition will take time,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""Our commitment is to be a responsible provider of that oil and gas.""

| Jump to first hitU.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. got a little help from their neighbour to the north last quarter.
A corporate tax rate cut in oil-rich Alberta, where both companies have operations, boosted Exxon's second-quarter profit by almost US$500 million, according to a statement Friday. Chevron noted a US$180-million non-cash tax benefit from the measure in its report.
While a Canadian tax cut benefiting U.S. companies may seem like a misfire in an era of rising trade tensions, the measure is working as intended. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has made the tax cut a centrepiece of his effort to bring jobs and global investment back to the province, which was hit hard by the 2014 crash in global oil prices and by pipeline delays.
The province has seen international companies including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sell their local operations, stoking concerns about the region's competitiveness.
The tax supported by Kenney, who took power in April, trimmed the corporate rate to 11 per cent from 12 per cent starting last month. It's already the lowest in Canada, and will continue to decline in the coming years, reaching eight per cent in 2022. At that point, it will be lower than in 44 U.S. states, according to Kenney's office.
The tax cut represents a material improvement in Alberta's business environment, but it's still only one part of the fiscal, economic and regulatory conditions that determine a region's competitiveness, said Rich Kruger, chief executive of Imperial Oil Ltd., the Exxon-owned Canadian oilsands company that benefited from the tax cut. Kruger lauded other moves by Kenney's government, including changes to the province's carbon tax and reductions in regulations as helping to improve the business environment as well.
""Any step that continues to enhance our competitiveness in a global industry, which oil and gas is because we've got to compete globally for capital, is a good step,"" Kruger said in an interview. ""How fast does it lead to new investment? That's a different question because we still have other things we're dealing with, like a lack of pipeline space right now.""
To be sure, Alberta-based oil producers including Suncor Energy Inc. and Cenovus Energy Inc. also reported substantial second-quarter benefits from the measure.
""These tax cuts are a vital part of our plan to reignite the economy, support job creators and get Albertans working again,"" Kenney said in a statement after the cuts were signed into law in June. ""We are hearing from companies around the world that are looking at Alberta as a prime location for investment, relocation and expansion.""

The province has seen international companies including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, ConocoPhillips and Total SA sell their local operations, stoking concerns about the region's competitiveness. The tax supported by Kenney, who took power in April, trimmed the corporate rate to 11 per cent from 12 per cent starting last month. It's already the lowest in Canada, and will continue to decline in the coming years, reaching eight per cent in 2022. At that point, it will be lower than in 44 U.S. states, according to Kenney's office.
The tax cut represents a material improvement in Alberta's business environment, but it's still only one part of the fiscal, economic and regulatory conditions that determine a region's competitiveness, said Rich Kruger, chief executive of Imperial Oil Ltd., the Exxon-owned Canadian oilsands company that benefited from the tax cut. Kruger lauded other moves by Kenney's government, including changes to the province's carbon tax and reductions in regulations as helping to improve the business environment as well.
""Any step that continues to enhance our competitiveness in a global industry, which oil and gas is because we've got to compete globally for capital, is a good step,"" Kruger said in an interview. ""How fast does it lead to new investment? That's a different question because we still have other things we're dealing with, like a lack of pipeline space right now.""
To be sure, Alberta-based oil producers including Suncor Energy Inc. and Cenovus Energy Inc. also reported substantial second-quarter benefits from the measure.
""These tax cuts are a vital part of our plan to reignite the economy, support job creators and get Albertans working again,"" Kenney said in a statement after the cuts were signed into law in June. ""We are hearing from companies around the world that are looking at Alberta as a prime location for investment, relocation and expansion.""

| Jump to first hitChevron Phillips Chemical Co. potential stake in Calgary-based Nova Chemicals could signal the return of oil majors in Alberta's energy sector, according to analysts.
Reuters reported Thursday that a joint venture between Chevron Corp. and Phillips 66 Co. made a US$15-billion bid to acquire Nova Chemicals, quoting people familiar with the matter.
""Nova's been spending a lot of money lately, but none of it in Canada other than the Sarnia plant so it might mean we've seen the multinationals exit Alberta on the oilsand side,"" said Bill Rawlusyk, executive director of natural gas liquids at IHS Inc. ""It means a multinational with big pockets coming back to Alberta, which would be a good thing in my opinion.""
Nova is run by the UAE stateowned Mubadala Investment Co., while Chevron Phillips is headquartered in Texas with 31 facilities in the U.S., Singapore, Belgium, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar.
Chevron has off-loaded some of its Canadian assets, including the 57,000-bpd Burnaby refinery in British Columbia, to Parkland Fuel Corporation in 2017. It maintains a 20-per-cent interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, operated by Canadian Natural Resources, and a 60-per-cent operated interest in its Ells River heavy oil leases, and is investing in its shale resources in the Duvernay in west-central Alberta, apart from other oil and gas interests.
Chevron did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If the deal proceeds, Chevron Phillips will become the third largest producer of polyethylene in North America, behind Exxon-Mobil Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. It will also become the largest producer of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in the continent, ahead of LyondellBasell Industries N.V.
Another buyer may yet emerge for Nova, and Mubadala could also decide to keep a stake in Nova in any deal that arises, Reuters reported.
HDPEs are used in plastic water bottles, corrosion-resistant piping and plastic lumber. The global market for HDPEs is expected to hit US$85.19 billion this year.
""The Nova acquisition would increase ethylene merchant exposure for Chevron Phillips. After the recent ethylene capacity increase at Cedar Bayou, TX, Chevron Phillips was exposed to 500 thousand tonnes of ethylene to the merchant market, while Nova, post its acquisition of Williams Geismar (an LA cracker) is exposed to approximately one million tonnes of ethylene,"" said Ashish Chitalia, Wood Mackenzie chemicals principal analyst. ""Together, the companies would have ethylene volumes equivalent of a world-scale cracker size of 1.5 million tonnes.""
Nova is proceeding with a $2-billion expansion plan for their Sarnia polyethylene plant in Ontario this year. It's backed by $100 million through Ontario's Jobs and Prosperity Fund and $35 million through Ottawa's Strategic Investment Fund.
The potential acquisition comes as the country's petrochemicals industry is in the midst of a rebound, boosted by dirt-cheap natural gas prices.
Capital spending on industrial chemical industry projects in Canada this year is expected to jump by 65 per cent to $1.9 billion, the highest since $2.2 billion spent in 2014, according to a year-end members survey by the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, which represents producers that contribute 75 per cent of the country's chemical products by value.
Rawlusyk sees a unique advantage for companies to build petrochemical plants in Canada, especially given the incentives offered by the previous government in Alberta.
""Certainly the attraction would be cheap ethane because natural gas prices are so low, and the market is pretty much balanced at the moment. There's been a lot of talk about another big ethane cracker being built in Alberta,"" said Rawlusyk. ""The government has offered a bunch of money for that as well. These are multi-billion investments for new crackers, and they would need some way to get incremental ethane out of the natural gas so there would need to be some investment in extraction facilities as well.""
Headquartered in Calgary, Nova Chemicals was founded in 1954. Over the years, it has diversified its business beyond foam packaging and insulation to foam beverage cups and containers.
Nova Chemicals reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $271 million in the first three months of 2019, down from $418 million a year earlier, according to its website.
Abu Dhabi acquired Nova Chemicals for $500 million in 2009 using its stated-owned International Petroleum Investment Co (IPIC), saving it from a financing restructuring due to its large debt. Since then, the company's business has grown rapidly, taking advantage of the shale-driven natural resources boom in North America. Two years ago, Abu Dhabi merged IPIC with Mubadala, which manages over $225 billion in assets. The emirate has looked into consolidating its holdings and retrenching from some overseas businesses.
""The petrochemical market is consolidating, with the main players - ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, LyondellBasell, Dow - expanding organically or through M&A. Since 2018, many petrochemical companies are under pressure owing to the slow economic growth outlook, the credit crunch in India/China, US-China trade war and the plastic backlash,"" said Chitalia.
""The deal with Nova Chemicals would allow Chevron and Phillips 66 to diversify further into this market while increasing competitiveness and market reach. North American ethane feedstock advantage makes the region an ideal location for acquisitions or expansions in the ethylene-polyethylene sector.""

A federal appeals court ruled that lawsuits by Delaware and Hoboken, N.J., seeking compensation from oil companies for the impacts of climate change should be decided in state, not federal courts.
The decision Wednesday is the latest procedural victory by state and municipal governments, which have sought to bring climate-liability cases against companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC under state laws, after similar earlier efforts under federal laws proved unsuccessful.
The lawsuits before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit are among at least two dozen filed by states and cities in recent years, arguing that the oil industry should be on the hook for damages caused by fossil fuels. The cases, which environmentalists have likened to state litigation against tobacco companies for recovery of healthcare costs, represent a major legal threat to the oil industry.
Oil companies have denied liability in the cases and have sought to resolve the disputes in federal courts. But state and local governments—including the cities of Baltimore, Honolulu and Boulder, Colo., Rhode Island, and a group of cities and counties in California—have successfully argued that their cases should be fought at the state level, bringing some of them closer to trial.
Wednesday's decision marked the latest appeals court to rule that state court is the proper venue for such lawsuits, after years of jockeying over jurisdiction. It was the sixth such appeals court ruling this year to keep climate cases by states and cities in state court.
""Climate change is an important problem with national and global implications. But federal courts cannot hear cases just because they are important,"" Judge Stephanos Bibas wrote for the three-judge panel that ruled in favor of Delaware and Hoboken.
Several federal courts, including in New York and California, had earlier issued rulings that sided with oil companies in the disputes, finding that under federal law, the issues should be decided by other branches of the U.S. government, not through environmental liability litigation. A 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling found that utility companies couldn't be sued for liability because the Clean Air Act gives regulatory power to the Environmental Protection Agency.
Oil companies, in arguing to keep the cases in court, pointed to a Second Circuit decision from last year that upheld a dismissal of a climate-liability lawsuit brought by New York City. The court said that state court was inappropriate because global warming is ""an international problem of national concern.""
The Supreme Court could still weigh in on the matter of where the latest cases should be decided: Oil companies have asked the high court to overturn the appeals court ruling that found Boulder's lawsuit should be argued in state court.
Theodore Boutrous, Chevron's attorney in the cases, said the company disagreed with the Third Circuit's decision. The cases, he said, belong in federal court ""due to their sweeping implications for national energy policy, national security, foreign policy and other uniquely federal interests.""
Ryan Meyers, the general counsel for the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that is also a party in the lawsuits, said the suits were a distraction and waste of taxpayer dollars.
""We believe these cases belong in the federal courts, but ultimately climate policy is an issue for Congress to debate, not the court system,"" he said.
Matthew Brinckerhoff, an attorney representing Hoboken, said the decision showed that what he described as the industry's ""delay tactics"" in seeking to keep the cases from trial were failing.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. scooped up millions more shares of Apple Inc. and doubled down on its energy investments, while the stock market swooned in the second quarter.
The moves were made public in Berkshire's 13F filing, which was released after the stock market closed Monday. Regulations require institutional investors managing more than $100 million to file the form, which lays out firms' equity holdings as of the end of the most recent quarter, as well as the size and market value of their positions.
The filing showed Berkshire bought 3.9 million shares of Apple, with its stake worth $125 billion as of the end of June. Apple makes up roughly 40% of Berkshire's stock portfolio.
Berkshire also purchased 22 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and 2.3 million shares of Chevron Corp. in the second quarter, adding to its big bet this year on U.S. oil. It added to its stakes in Ally Financial Inc. and Paramount Global, among other companies.
Meanwhile, Berkshire closed out its stakes in Verizon Communications Inc. and Royalty Pharma PLC and trimmed its holdings of General Motors Co., U.S. Bancorp and Kroger Co. It didn't open any new positions.
Investors closely watch what Berkshire is buying and selling because of Mr. Buffett's reputation as one of the most successful investors of all time. While Mr. Buffett doesn't personally pick all of the company's stock investments—Berkshire's decision to begin buying shares of Apple in 2016, for instance, was made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler—investors nevertheless like to draw as many insights as they can from Berkshire's filings.
Berkshire's five biggest stockholdings as of the end of June were Apple, Bank of America Corp., Coca-Cola Co., Chevron and American Express Co. The five stocks made up about 69% of Berkshire's portfolio, according to company filings.
Berkshire had already disclosed that it bought roughly $6.2 billion of stocks in the second quarter. That was down from a whopping $51 billion in the first quarter but nevertheless extended a recent buying streak for the company.
It's a stark change from last year. The Omaha, Neb.-based Berkshire, which includes railroad, energy and insurance businesses, as well as a huge investment portfolio, largely stuck to repurchasing its own shares in 2021. As recently as February, Mr. Buffett had lamented a lack of good buying opportunities as a way of explaining why Berkshire was mostly investing in its own stock.
But in the months since, market volatility has shot up. That has given Berkshire a chance to put its cash to work—especially within the energy sector. Berkshire snapped up shares of Occidental Petroleum as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent oil prices surging.
Investors and analysts have said Berkshire's buying potentially reflects a view from Mr. Buffett that inflation in energy prices will remain elevated for some time . They have also noted that Mr. Buffett has expressed admiration of Occidental's commitment to paying down debt, issuing dividends and buying back Occidental's stock.
Energy stocks have been by far the best performers in the market this year. Occidental is up more than 110% for the year, while the S&P 500 is down 9.8%. U.S. crude was up 19% for the year through Friday but down 28% from its March high.

Investors are pressing for more changes at companies after securities regulators made it harder for the businesses to exclude shareholder proposals from proxy statements.
The Securities and Exchange Commission in November tightened the rules regarding when a company can cite ""micromanagement"" or lack of relevance as reasons for omitting an investor proposal from regulatory filings, known as proxy statements, ahead of annual meetings where they are voted on by shareholders. The SEC specifically said proposals that raise issues of broad social or ethical concern may not be excluded .
Already, shareholder proposal numbers are on the rise. Investors submitted 650 proposals to S&P 500 companies as of July 29, up from 613 proposals and 556 proposals during the same period in 2021 and 2020, respectively, according to Esgauge, a data analytics firm. All but 12 proposals this year were related to environmental, social and governance issues, the data shows.
Last month, the SEC proposed additional changes, which aren't yet in effect.
""These changes will make it more challenging to get shareholder proposals excluded,"" said Laura Richman, counsel at law firm Mayer Brown, who didn't speak about specific proposals. ""So we may see more of them next year.""
Companies have to spend more time and money to engage with investors as they submit more proposals and become more prescriptive in what they are asking for, lawyers said. The latter is resulting in a lower percentage of proposals gaining majority support. It dropped to 10.6% this year from 16.2% last year, according to Esgauge.
""Investors got more ambitious in the prescriptiveness of their proposals, and therefore they lost some support,"" said Marc Gerber, a partner at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, who didn't speak about specific companies or proposals. ""But there were plenty of proposals that didn't get too prescriptive, that still garnered significant support.""
Technology giant Apple Inc. and videogame company Activision Blizzard Inc. in this year's proxy season were pressed to review some of their corporate practices and policies, while Alaska Air Group Inc., an airline holding company, was asked to seek shareholder approval for severance payouts. At Chevron Corp., shareholders requested the energy company issue a report on its methane emissions.
Most shareholder proposals are nonbinding and don't require action from a company. But if they gain majority or even significant support—or about 25% to 30% of votes—investors expect companies to act.
""In our view, when a proposal has received a solid level of support from investors, that should generally be a signal to the board that this is a material issue to investors and something that they should look into,"" said Derek Butcher, senior manager for corporate governance and responsible investment at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., an asset manager.
San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron engaged with shareholders this spring on a proposal to provide more information about methane emissions, said Michael Rubio, director of sustainability at Chevron. After the engagement, the board assessed—and ultimately supported—the proposal because the company agreed with the goal, Mr. Rubio said.
The proposal, which showed up on Chevron's April 7 proxy statement, received 98% support from shareholders. Mr. Rubio declined to comment on the costs associated with engaging with shareholders and producing the report on methane emissions, which is set to be released by the end of the year. Whether Chevron's board will adopt a similar strategy for future proposals depends on shareholders' demands, he said.
""As the board evaluates the narrative of each shareholder proposal, it'll go through its process and determine if we could find a win-win opportunity,"" Mr. Rubio said. ""We welcome the engagement and the enhanced discussion.""
James McRitchie, an individual investor in close to 200 companies, said he submitted around 80 shareholder proposals this year. Roughly 30 of those were resolved by agreements with the companies before the annual meetings were held. Companies were able to exclude another 12 from their proxies, he said. The rest were either voted on or will be voted on at coming meetings.
Shareholder proposals have naturally become more prescriptive in recent years, Mr. McRitchie said. If a company says it will reduce emissions by 2050, the next step for an investor might be to ask a company for a report on how it will get there, he said.
BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager with about $8.5 trillion under management as of June 30, said in a report last week that it supported fewer climate-related proposals this year. The company in part attributed the decline to ""more prescriptive"" proposals and declined to comment beyond its report.
Boards often recommend that investors vote against their shareholders' proposals, typically noting that a company is already working on the issue or that what is asked for isn't in shareholders' best interest. This was the case at Apple, which recommended voting against a proposal that sought a third-party assessment on how the company's policies and practices adversely affect matters such as gender and racial equity among employees. After roughly 54% of shareholders backed the proposal, Apple in April committed to conducting a civil rights audit. The company declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard said in June that it would consider a proposal asking for a public report on the company's efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination, after it initially recommended that investors vote against it.
Shareholders sought greater transparency on these issues following a California regulatory agency's lawsuit against the company last year alleging widespread sexual harassment. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick knew about the allegations and didn't tell the company's board members. The company said in June that an internal review didn't reveal any evidence that senior executives played down or ignored reports of harassment.
After the shareholder proposal received around 67% support at the June annual meeting, the company said it would ""carefully consider"" the proposal. The company declined to comment beyond the statement released after the annual meeting.
At Alaska Air, shareholders at the May annual meeting requested the board to seek approval for any senior managers' new or renewed pay package that would provide for severance or termination payments above a certain amount. While the board recommended that shareholders vote against the proposal, it received nearly 55% support. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.
Companies should expect an increase in proposals for next year's proxy season, said Skadden's Mr. Gerber. Shareholders will also likely tweak proposals that received less voting support than anticipated in this year's proxy season, he said. ""I think they'll make adjustments and perhaps be less prescriptive in an effort to get even more shareholder voting support,"" he said.

Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, the three largest Western oil companies, banked a record $46 billion in collective profits in the second quarter, fueled by the highest energy prices in over a decade and lucrative oil-refining margins.
Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said Friday its second-quarter profit rose to $17.9 billion, its highest ever and nearly four times as much as the year-earlier period, citing rising oil and fuel production, higher energy prices and cost cuts. Chevron also posted a record profit Friday of $11.6 billion, up from $3.1 billion a year earlier.
The companies are reaping the benefits of record fuel-making margins following the shutdown of 3 million barrels a day of global refining capacity since the onset of the pandemic in 2020. Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said that while refining margins have moderated recently, it's a situation that could take years to fix until additional capacity comes online.
""Demand recovers, and we don't have the capacity to meet that, which has led to record, record refining margins,"" Mr. Woods said. ""This will be a few-year price environment.""
On Thursday, Shell reported its second consecutive record quarterly profit, hitting $16.7 billion on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis, a figure similar to net income that U.S. oil companies report.
The companies' results mark a significant turnaround for an industry that hemorrhaged cash and saw scores of companies file for bankruptcy following the worldwide outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020. Exxon and Chevron posted historic losses that year, and Exxon got booted from the Dow Jones Industrial Average while energy sunk to less than 2.5% of the S&P 500.
But the cash the oil giants are generating has become a political touchpoint as high fuel prices have emerged as a liability for President Biden and Democrats in Congress ahead of midterm elections in November. In June, Mr. Biden was asked if he would go after Exxon's profits. ""We're going to make sure everybody knows Exxon's profits,"" he said. ""Exxon made more money than God this year.""
Mr. Biden has called on the companies to increase oil and gas production as well as refining capacity to help lower fuel prices.
Exxon said it is working to meet global energy demand through its plans to expand early next year a refinery in Beaumont, Texas, by 250,000 barrels a day, the largest such expansion since 2012. It also noted it has boosted production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico by 130,000 barrels of oil-equivalent a day compared with the first half of 2021.
""Those investments are really helping to increase production at a time when the world needs it most,"" Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said, noting its capital and exploration spending was up about 40% year-over-year.
Exxon's oil and gas production was up about 4% from the same period last year. Chevron's oil-and-gas production declined globally about 7.4% compared with a year earlier, largely due to the end of projects in Thailand and Indonesia, though its production rose in the U.S. by about 3.2%.
""Supply is responding,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.
Senate Democrats struck a deal with a pivotal lawmaker, Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), to help pave the way for a proposed $369 billion bill that would include tax incentives to put more money into green energy. It also has provisions that benefit fossil-fuel companies, including requiring the Interior Department to offer oil companies millions of federal acres onshore and offshore over the next decade.
Oil and gas demand has roared back as countries have lifted pandemic quarantine measures. Western sanctions against Russian energy have pushed commodity prices even higher. Now, as the U.S. economy is contracting, the oil industry's lofty earnings have become a rare bright spot for investors.
Oil and gas shares have outperformed the market this year, with the S&P 500 Energy index up about 35% since the start of 2022, compared with a 15% drop for the broader index. Since the start of 2022, Exxon and Chevron shares are up about 46% and 26%, respectively, while the energy sector has grown to more than 4% of the S&P 500.
Still, many institutional investors, such as pension and mutual funds, remain reluctant to back fossil-fuel companies primarily because of concerns about their impact on the climate and long-term questions about their profitability as some countries shift to greener energy. But, the companies' recent performance has made the sector harder for those investors to ignore, said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive and senior portfolio manager of Adams Funds.
""When you have a sector that went from under 2.5% of the S&P 500 to over 4%, it gets everybody's attention,"" Mr. Stoeckle said. ""If you ignored energy for the last seven or eight years, you were paid handsomely for doing so. Now, the landscape has changed.""
Exxon and Chevron shares were up 4.6% and 8.9%, respectively, on Friday, a day when U.S. crude briefly topped $100 per barrel.
Despite the record profits, Exxon and Chevron signaled they would stick with relatively conservative spending plans in the oil patch, instead choosing to reward investors and strengthen their finances. Exxon returned $7.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter. With a cash balance of $18.9 billion, a $12 billion increase from the end of 2021, Exxon's ratio of net debt to capital dropped to 13%, which would help gird the company for an economic slowdown.
Chevron lifted the upper end of its share-repurchase program this year to as much as $15 billion, up from $10 billion, and paid off debt. Shell plans to buy back an additional $6 billion in shares over the next quarter, while also reducing its net debt.
As fears of an economic slowdown mount, it is unclear how deeply oil demand will be affected, analysts said. Average U.S. refining margins for gasoline and diesel have recently declined by 47% and 25%, respectively, from second-quarter levels, according to Houston investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. But margins remain lofty compared with prior years and will continue to keep refining profitable at least through the third quarter, if not longer, analysts said.

""Supply is responding,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber.

Exxon and Chevron shares were up Friday about 4.5% and 8%, respectively, on a day when U.S. crude prices climbed almost 4% to more than $100 per barrel.
Despite the record profits, Exxon and Chevron signaled they will stick with relatively conservative spending plans in the oil patch, instead choosing to reward investors and strengthen their finances. Exxon returned $7.6 billion to shareholders in the quarter. With a cash balance of $18.9 billion, a $12 billion increase from the end of 2021, Exxon's ratio of net debt to capital dropped to 13%, which would help gird the company for an economic slowdown.
San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron lifted the upper end of its share-repurchase program this year to as much as $15 billion, up from $10 billion, and paid off debt. Shell plans to buy back another $6 billion in shares over the next quarter, while also reducing its net debt.
One of the biggest drivers of the record profits for Exxon, Chevron and Shell were the highest fuel-making margins in recent memory. On Thursday, U.S. oil refiners Valero Energy Corp. and PBF Energy Inc. posted profits of $4.7 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, the highest quarterly earnings since at least 1998 for Valero and 2012 for PBF, according to FactSet.
Analysts said refining earnings may have peaked in the second quarter. Fuel demand took a hit during the height of America's summer driving season, as consumers balked at prices that hit a record national average of more than $5 a gallon in June.
As fears of an economic slowdown mount, it is unclear how deeply oil demand will be affected, analysts said. But average U.S. refining margins for gasoline and diesel have recently declined by 47% and 25%, respectively, from second-quarter levels, according to Houston investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.
Margins remain lofty compared with prior years and will continue to keep refining profitable at least through the third quarter, if not longer, analysts said.
Given the high amounts of cash oil companies are generating, they are likely to favor returning most of that to shareholders, said Ryan Todd, an oil-industry analyst at investment bank Piper Sandler Companies. But many oil companies are also working to build excess cash on their balance sheets after their harrowing experience in 2020, he said.
""It's important for the long-term viability of the industry to show investors they have a business model that's resilient through the cycle,"" Mr. Todd said. ""There's always a cycle. The cycle's going to turn.""

Chevron Corp. is planning to sell its current headquarters in California and is offering to cover costs for some employees to relocate to Texas, the latest move by a large U.S. employer to reduce the size of its offices.
The second-largest U.S. oil company said it would remain based in California, its home state for more than 140 years, but will be leaving its Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, its global headquarters for two decades.
Chevron said it would cover moving costs for employees who voluntarily opt to move to Houston, as it determines the extent to which it will reduce its staffing in the Golden State. It said it is looking for a new, smaller space to lease in San Ramon, in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and expects to move from its existing headquarters in late 2023.
Chevron's presence in Houston has been growing in recent years, while its footprint in California has been shrinking. The Houston office now employs nearly 6,000 people, roughly three times as many as the California headquarters, which has been declining after the company began a reorganization in 2019.
A spokesman for Chevron said the current real-estate market offers the company an opportunity to adjust its office-space needs.
Many U.S. businesses are reconsidering their headquarters' spaces as they contemplate a future of hybrid home-and-office work, and weigh the potential benefits of moving more of their operations to states with lower taxes and costs of living.
Chevron's plans to decamp from its current headquarters follow similar recent moves by several large U.S. companies, including machinery giant Caterpillar Inc., aerospace company Boeing Co., defense contractor Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Chevron's closest rival, Exxon Mobil Corp., which is moving its headquarters outside Dallas to Houston next year.
Exxon's center of gravity had drifted from Irving, Texas, to the Houston area a few years ago when it opened a campus in Spring, Texas, large enough to house 10,000 workers. In January, Exxon said it would move its headquarters to the Spring location as part of a reorganization of its businesses.
Boeing and Caterpillar recently said they would leave the Chicago area and move their headquarters to Arlington, Va., and Irving, Texas, respectively.

Chevron's presence in Houston, where it occupies the former Enron Corp. headquarters in the heart of downtown, has been growing in recent years, while its footprint in California has been shrinking. The Houston office now employs nearly 6,000 people, roughly three times as many as the population of the California headquarters, which has been declining after the company began a reorganization in 2019.
A spokesman for Chevron said the current real-estate market offers the company an opportunity to adjust its office-space needs.

On the Move
A closer look at other headquarters moves by large U.S. companies, as selected by WSJ editors.
Exxon's center of gravity had drifted from Irving, Texas, to the Houston area a few years ago when it opened a campus in Spring, Texas, large enough to house 10,000 workers. In January, Exxon said it would move its headquarters to the Spring location as part of a reorganization of its businesses.
Boeing and Caterpillar recently said they would leave the Chicago area and move their headquarters to Arlington, Va., and Irving, Texas, respectively. Raytheon said it is relocating to Arlington from Waltham, Mass. Billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge-fund firm Citadel said this week that it would move from Chicago to Miami .
Chevron, one of the descendants of the Standard Oil monopoly, has had its headquarters in the greater Bay Area since the early days of its first corporate ancestor, Pacific Coast Oil Co., in 1879. It moved hundreds of employees to San Ramon in 1999, and in 2001 said it would become the company's headquarters.
Some of Chevron's executives have long wanted to move the company's headquarters to Texas, but its leadership has held off, largely because of the company's long history in California and its assets there, such as its Richmond, Calif., refinery, according to people familiar with the matter.
California lawmakers have previously considered imposing a severance tax that would tax oil production in the state. If California were to impose such a tax, that would likely prompt Chevron to reconsider keeping its headquarters in the state, one of the people said.
In recent decades, Houston has become the capital of the U.S. oil and natural-gas industry, with Texas leaders including Gov. Greg Abbott and former Gov. Rick Perry touting lower taxes and a lighter regulatory burden on businesses compared with California and other states. Texas doesn't have a state income tax and its real estate is generally less expensive than in California.
The sale of Chevron's nearly 100-acre campus in San Ramon will likely attract plenty of interest from the area's life-sciences industry or developers looking to build high-end apartments and retail stores, said Trent Barmby, a California-based senior managing director at commercial property firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.
""It's a generational redevelopment opportunity and it almost certainly won't stay in its current form,"" Mr. Barmby said. ""In today's world and what's happened with offices, that is not going to be its highest and best use.""

Russia is still finding a home for much of its oil despite expanding sanctions, but its production likely will diminish following the departure of Western oil companies, Chevron Corp. Chief Executive Mike Wirth said.
In a meeting with Wall Street Journal reporters and editors last week, Mr. Wirth noted many countries continued to buy crude from Russia, one of the top oil producers along with the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.
But he said that it would be difficult for Russia to overcome the loss of Western technology and capital, noting that other once-large oil producers have seen output fall after sanctions and the pullout of international oil companies.
""If you look at Iran and Venezuela, two other examples of large producers that have come under sanctions and have been pretty well cut off from the same kinds of investments and technology, their productive capacity degrades over time,"" Mr. Wirth said.
After decades of carving out footholds in Russia's oil business, BP PLC, Shell PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. said they would exit their operations in the country after Russia's invasion of Ukraine began in late February. A few weeks later, oil-field services giants Halliburton Co., Baker Hughes Co. and Schlumberger Ltd., which provide equipment and workers needed to extract oil, all said they would suspend new investments in Russia.
Chevron didn't have any sizable operations in Russia and was the least affected major oil company.
The European Union is planning to move forward with a partial embargo of Russian oil, and many Western refiners have stopped buying supplies from Russia. Even so, Mr. Wirth said Russian energy products are still finding willing buyers around the world at discounted prices, and so oil-market participants for now are responding to the prospect of reduced supply, rather than a large drop in oil production. Russian oil is still flowing as some shippers and refiners hide its origins.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers aligned with it last week agreed to an increase in production later this summer that was larger than anticipated, which could lead Saudi Arabia to boost output.
President Biden had earlier called for OPEC to increase production in response to rising energy prices, but the group had rebuffed his requests. The new commitments were seen as a move that could pave the way for Mr. Biden to visit Saudi Arabia later this month, as the U.S. and the kingdom seek to reset what has recently been a strained relationship.
Mr. Wirth said if Mr. Biden wanted to see global oil supplies rise, Saudi Arabia was among the very few producers with spare capacity to bring more crude to market quickly.
""This is the role Saudi has historically played,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""In the context of the broader relationship and whatever discussions may be ongoing, if that can lead to more supply into the market, that's a positive outcome for world energy markets."""

Mr. Wirth, who has been Chevron's CEO since 2018, said while investors are still interested in the San Ramon, Calif.-based oil major's strategy to reduce carbon emissions from its operations, the thrust of the company's discussions with some of its largest shareholders has recently shifted to how the industry is ensuring the world has enough energy.
""We can't just chase only low-carbon energy when that's the popular thing and now when fundamentals are good in our traditional business, we can't just set that aside and say we're just going to drill, drill, drill,"" he said.
Chevron, he said, is working to find a balance between those two priorities while returning cash to shareholders following several years in which the U.S. oil industry lagged behind the broader market in returns. Chevron in April said that it made $6.3 billion in profit during the first quarter, its highest in almost a decade, and that it was buying back shares at the upper end of a $5 billion-to-$10 billion range set for this year.
""We're back now into better times and we need to return cash to the people who own the company,"" he said.

The U.S. extended a limited license held by Chevron Corp. on Tuesday that allows the oil company to maintain its operations in Venezuela and negotiate future business in an attempt to encourage talks between the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the U.S.-backed opposition to open a path to free and fair elections.
The U.S. didn't expand the license to allow Chevron to drill for and market Venezuelan crude, as the company had hoped.
Chevron didn't respond to a request to comment.
The extension of the license allows Chevron to have talks with Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-owned oil company with which it has a joint venture. Previously the company couldn't directly negotiate with any officials sanctioned by the U.S. Chevron has been lobbying the U.S. to permit it to drill for crude and sell it in the world market to help bring down energy prices after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
A Biden administration official said as part of the moves, the U.S. would also remove Carlos Erik Malpica-Flores, the nephew of Venezuela's first lady and a former top PDVSA official, from a list of sanctioned individuals.
The moves by the U.S. appear to be a reply to a meeting by senior U.S. officials, including Juan Gonzalez, the senior National Security Council official in charge of Latin America, and James Story, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela, with Mr. Maduro and other senior Venezuelan officials in March. As a result of those meetings, the Maduro government freed two U.S. citizens imprisoned in Venezuela.
The senior U.S. officials emphasized Tuesday that the U.S. was acting at the request of the government of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who is recognized as interim president of Venezuela by the U.S. After the March meetings, Mr. Guaido and others in the Venezuelan opposition feared that their aspirations for a restoration of democracy in the country would be sacrificed by the Biden administration's need to increase world oil production to lower oil prices.
Mr. Guaido's office in a statement denied that the Venezuelan opposition had asked the Biden administration for the lifting of ""personal sanctions"" as in the case of Mr. Malpica-Flores.
U.S. officials denied that the latest moves by the administration had anything to do with the world energy situation."

The senior U.S. officials emphasized Tuesday that the U.S. was acting at the request of the government of opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who is recognized as interim president of Venezuela by the U.S. After the March meetings in Caracas, Mr. Guaidó and others in the Venezuelan opposition feared that their aspirations for restoration of democracy in the country would be sacrificed amid the Biden administration's need to increase world oil production to lower oil prices.
The move in March to lift sanctions on Venezuela ran into fierce bilateral opposition especially from legislators in Florida, where many in a growing community of Venezuelan immigrants have made common cause with conservative Cuban-Americans. Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who opposed the move to lift sanctions in March, opposed Tuesday's action.
""Giving Maduro a handful of undeserved handouts just so that his regime will promise to sit down at a negotiating table is a strategy destined to fail,"" said Mr. Menendez. ""The Biden administration must refrain from lifting any additional sanctions until Maduro makes concrete concessions at the negotiating table.""
In a statement on her twitter account, Delcy Rodriguez, Mr. Maduro's vice president, said Venezuela hoped the U.S. moves would start the way to ""total lifting of the illicit sanctions"" leveled against the country.
Mr. Guaidó's office in a statement denied that the Venezuelan opposition had asked the Biden administration for the lifting of ""personal sanctions,"" as in the case of Mr. Malpica-Flores. ""Reaching any agreement can only happen if there are concrete steps taken on the path to liberty and democracy for Venezuela,"" the statement said.
The statement urged that negotiations, previously held in Mexico, but suspended by Mr. Maduro last year, to resume quickly.
U.S. officials denied that the latest moves by the administration had anything to do with the world energy situation. ""Our focus has been on supporting the interim government…to get the regime to take steps towards free and fair elections through negotiations,"" one official said. ""That has been the focus entirely, not the oil sector or not oil prices.""
The officials said the U.S. would calibrate its sanctions policy to respond to ""ambitious concrete and irreversible"" moves by the Maduro government toward the holding of free elections. ""We will reapply sanctions on the basis of any steps backward,"" the official said.
""We are in a scenario of flexibilization of sanctions by stages only if and when negotiations advance to a happy end,"" said Alejandro Grisanti, director of Ecoanalitica, a consulting firm that closely watches the Venezuelan oil industry. ""If there is progress, then the U.S. may allow Chevron a license to produce and export, so they can pay down their debt.""
Mr. Grisanti said he doubted that the Maduro government would agree to any negotiations that would end in free and fair elections.
In conversations earlier this year, Chevron executives told Biden administration officials they could help double Venezuela's roughly 800,000 barrels-a-day production within months, helping to replace the loss of about 700,000 barrels a day the U.S. was importing from Russia before Moscow attacked Ukraine. That could help lower gasoline prices in the U.S., which is a major concern for the Biden administration as it faces midterm elections in November.
Other analysts believe that Chevron's short-term projections of production increases are wildly optimistic.""Venezuela can only add 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day in the next six months,"" said Francisco Monaldi, the director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. ""It would have no impact on the world market or on the U.S. price of gasoline.""
Nevertheless, Mr. Monaldi said Venezuela is the only country in the Western Hemisphere, not counting the U.S. and Canada, that could significantly increase production in the long term. ""That's attractive, supposing the Russian invasion has a lasting impact on oil markets,"" he said.
Ironically, the Russian invasion has disrupted Venezuela's economy since it used now-sanctioned Russian banks to arrange payments for its crude. In addition, barrels of deeply discounted Russian crude are displacing sales of already discounted Venezuelan crude to independent refiners in China, the country's major market, Mr. Monaldi said.
Chevron, which has operated in Venezuela for nearly a century, is the only U.S. oil major to stay in the country, after the Venezuelan government nationalized billions of dollars owned by ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil and others.
The company took a charge of $2.6 billion in 2020 after it wrote down all of its assets. Nonetheless, Chevron has continued to try to get Venezuela to pay money owed to it under a production-sharing agreement, receiving periodic licenses from the U.S., which allow it to retain but not operate assets.

 U.S. Allows Chevron to Maintain Venezuela Operations but Won't Permit Drilling"
2520737324,3-May-21,Lawsuit Without End: 28 Years So Far --- Chevron lost an Ecuador pollution case. U.S. courts deemed it fraudulent. The fight goes on.,https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/buffett-buys-stocks-as-markets-fall/docview/2664997781/se-2?accountid=7064,CVX,"The stock market's selloff has been bad news for most investors.
Not for Warren Buffett and his team.
Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has used the slump as an opportunity to increase spending on stocks, deploying tens of billions of dollars the past couple of months after ending 2021 with a near-record cash pile.
The Omaha, Neb., company bought 901,768 shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. last week, according to a regulatory filing. The move makes Occidental, in which Berkshire began buying shares in late February, one of its 10 biggest holdings.
In the past few months, Berkshire has also boosted its stake in Chevron Corp., placed a merger-arbitrage bet on Activision Blizzard Inc. bought shares of HP Inc., Citigroup Inc. and Ally Financial Inc., and continued adding to its position in Apple Inc., which remained its biggest stockholding.
Meanwhile, it exited from its position in Wells Fargo & Co., formerly one of its top stock holdings and a part of the Berkshire portfolio since 1989.
Investors got a look at what Berkshire has been buying and selling when it filed what is known as Form 13-F with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. The SEC requires all institutional investors that manage more than $100 million to file the form within 45 days of the end of each quarter. Because institutions must disclose their equity holdings on the form, as well as the size and market value of each position, investors often use 13-Fs to gauge how large money managers are playing the stock market.
Mr. Buffett, an adherent of value investing, has long advised that investors ""be greedy when others are fearful."" That philosophy was likely difficult to practice for much of the past two years, during which investors' mood largely seemed anything but fearful. Now, that the market is slumping, Berkshire is in a prime position to add to its mammoth stock portfolio, investors say.
""Cash is dry powder, and he has a lot of it,"" said Rupal Bhansali, chief investment officer for global equities at Ariel Investments, of Mr. Buffett. Ms. Bhansali manages Ariel's global mutual fund, which owns Berkshire shares.
Ms. Bhansali, among others, also believes that Berkshire's investments in Chevron and Occidental might reflect a bet that commodities prices will stay elevated for some time.
Energy stocks have been by far the best-performing group in the S&P 500 this year, benefiting from a surge in commodities prices that began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns about disruptions to oil and gas supply lines. Chevron shares are up 47% this year, while Occidental shares have gone up 134%. In comparison, the S&P 500 has fallen 16%.
""They're clearly owning companies that are likely to be an inflation hedge,"" Ms. Bhansali said.
Energy stocks also offer two characteristics that Mr. Buffett has traditionally gravitated toward: low valuations as well as shareholder returns in buybacks and dividends, said Jim Shanahan, senior equity research analyst at Edward Jones.
Dividend-paying stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 this year, in part as investors whipsawed by market volatility have sought out stocks that can offer steady cash returns. ""It fits the profile,"" Mr. Shanahan said of Berkshire's Chevron and Occidental share purchases.
Berkshire also ramped up its purchases of bank stocks, which also tend to trade at relatively low valuations and offer dividends. The company bought 55 million shares of Citigroup in the first quarter, a stake valued at about $3 billion. The move marks a reversal of sorts for Berkshire: It unloaded much of its bank stocks in 2020, selling Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and much of its Wells Fargo stake, only to miss out on the financial sector's remarkable rally in the second half of the year and 2021.
""They faced a lot of criticism for not having done more in March and April 2020,"" Mr. Shanahan said of Berkshire. ""But they defended it by saying back then they didn't know how bad it was going to get. It was a different environment.""

There is a cottage industry on Wall Street predicting what would Warren buy . That, of course, refers to Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.B) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett , one of the most successful investors in history.
This year, amid stormy investing seas , Buffett seems to be focusing on shareholder yield. Other investors might want to pay attention to that value-investing metric.
New Buffett-buying speculation sprouts in May, right around Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Neb. This year's speculation is swirling around energy stocks after a note in the company's first-quarter financial filing about a big investment in oil giant Chevron (CVX).
""Approximately 66% of the aggregate fair value was concentrated in four companies,"" reads Berkshire's 10-Q report. ""American Express Company, $28.4 billion; Apple Inc., $159.1 billion; Bank of America Corporation, $42.6 billion and Chevron Corporation, $25.9 billion."" Chevron is a surprise No. 4. It looks as if Berkshire added about 120 million shares of Chevron in the quarter.
Buffett likes oil these days. Oil prices are up, but a reason he likes the stocks likely is more about how companies are spending their free cash flow. Chevron is giving more of its cash flow back to shareholders instead of investing it.
Buffett, answering an annual meeting question about equity purchases in the first quarter, also cited Occidental Petroleum (OXY), saying its capital return plan was simple and made sense. Berkshire is the largest holder of Occidental stock.
Occidental pays a 13-cent quarterly dividend, which works out to about yield of almost 1%. The company also plans to buy back about $3 billion worth of its own stock over the coming few quarters. The dividend and buyback, at roughly $3.5 billion, are consuming about half of the company's free cash flow. Most of the remaining cash is going toward debt reduction.
Occidental's total shareholder yield, which can be defined as dividends and buybacks divided by a company's market capitalization, is about 7%. Chevron's total shareholder yield, based on the first- quarter repurchase of stock, is about 5%.
About one-third of the non-financial companies in the S&P 500 have a total shareholder yield of greater than 5%, based on numbers reported over the past 12 months. That's roughly 120 firms and gives investors a lot to choose from.
Two other oil-and-gas companies with shareholder yields greater than 5%: Marathon Petroleum (MPC) at about 13% and APA (APA) at about 6%.
The top defense company, based on a screen of S&P 500 stocks, is L3Harris Technologies (LHX), with a shareholder yield of about 9%. One of the top industrial firms is engine make Cummins (CMI) at about 8%. A handful of chemical producers sport attractive yields, including DuPont de Nemours (DD), Dow Inc. (DOW) and Celanese (CE).
It isn't just old-economy companies. Meta Platforms (FB) and eBay (EBAY) have yields 10% and 26%, respectively. (eBay bought back about $7.2 billion worth of stock over the past 12 months).
Logistic giant FedEx (FDX), which trades for just 9 times calendar year 2022 estimated earnings, has a shareholder yield of about 6%. And home-improvement retailers Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW) come in at about 12% and 7%, respectively.
A screen isn't a substitute for a more thorough investigation of a company and its stock. But Buffett's approach can help investors in uncertain times.

Big oil companies are continuing to reap the benefits of high commodity prices but aren't backing off plans to reward investors while keeping production roughly flat.
Exxon Mobil Corp. said Friday it collected $5.5 billion in first-quarter profit, more than double the same period last year. The U.S. oil giant said it would triple its share repurchases, but will keep oil-field spending at a modest pace.
Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, on Friday said it made $6.3 billion in quarterly profit, its highest in almost a decade and up from about $1.4 billion in the same period last year. The company has paid out $4 billion to investors in dividends and share repurchases this year.
France's TotalEnergies reported $4.9 billion in profit on Thursday, and said it could double its share buybacks this quarter. Other European energy giants, Shell PLC and BP PLC, will post first-quarter results next week and are also expected to report strong profits.
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said underinvestment in oil and gas during the pandemic tightened supplies ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, which injected uncertainty in global markets.
Despite favorable market conditions, Mr. Woods and Chevron CEO Mike Wirth gave no indication Friday they have changed their thinking on boosting production. Energy executives say that sustained pressure from investors to return more cash to shareholders is the primary factor holding back investment in growth.
""We haven't stepped up our number of rigs,"" Mr. Wirth said Friday. ""We haven't stepped up spending.""
To a lesser extent, cost inflation is also deterring production growth as shortages of equipment and labor have become widespread in the U.S. shale patch. Mr. Woods said Exxon is feeling the impact of cost inflation in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oil field, but that it is working to keep growing oil production there without exceeding the cost of oil supply.
Though oil prices have largely held above $100 a barrel, China is battling another outbreak of Covid-19, bringing prices down from the highest levels since 2008 and raising concerns the outbreak could dent economic growth and hurt global air travel. Mr. Woods noted margins on chemical products have fallen sharply in Asia, a potential sign of economic trouble.
Exxon's net income was about 38% lower than analysts expected, according to FactSet. It took a $3.4 billion accounting charge after it decided to halt operations at its Sakhalin Island development in Russia's Far East. Even so, the Texas-based company is planning to boost its $10-billion share-buyback program to $30 billion through 2023, a sign of confidence in its underlying financial health as energy demand rises, Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said.
Both Exxon and Chevron have said their companywide production will be roughly flat from last year's levels or slightly down. Chevron's U.S. output was up about 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from the same period last year, while its international production was down 170,000 barrels a day. Exxon's overall production in the first quarter was down about 4% compared with the prior quarter due to weather and other factors.
Chevron also missed analysts' estimates on earnings, with net income coming in about 4.5% lower than anticipated, according to FactSet."

Mr. Woods noted margins on chemical products have fallen sharply in Asia, a potential sign of economic trouble .
Separately, U.S. economic growth fell at a 1.4% annual rate in the first quarter, the Commerce Department said this week, largely due to a widening trade deficit. Still, global oil supply growth has continued to lag behind demand.

""We anticipated this in 2020, with industry investment levels well below what was required to offset depletion,"" Mr. Woods said. ""That's why we worked so hard to preserve our capital expenditures during the depths of the pandemic.""
Exxon's net income was about 38% lower than analysts expected, according to FactSet. It took a $3.4 billion accounting charge after it decided to halt operations at its Sakhalin Island development in Russia's Far East. Even so, the Texas-based company is planning to boost its $10-billion share-buyback program to $30 billion through 2023, a sign of confidence in its underlying financial health as energy demand rises, Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said.
Total took a $4.1 billion accounting charge Wednesday on the value of its natural-gas reserves, citing impacts from the Western sanctions targeting Russia, and decisions by BP and Shell to exit their Russian investments are expected to weigh on their profitability.
Ms. Mikells, who joined Exxon last year as the company's first CFO , cited the company's ""strong balance sheet and liquidity situation"" as reasons it could boost its share repurchase program.
The company's upstream earnings rose by $1.1 billion from the last quarter as oil and gas prices have surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and as global demand continues to outpace supply growth.
""Especially given today's context and market environment, we're working very hard to increase production of low-cost barrels consistent with our overall plan,"" Ms. Mikells said, pointing to Exxon's investments in Guyana, liquefied natural gas and the Permian Basin, where it is seeking to increase production.
Chevron said it aims to raise output in the Permian 15% from 2021 levels this year, an increase from its prior growth target.
But both Exxon and Chevron have said their companywide production will be roughly flat from last year's levels or slightly down. Chevron's U.S. output was up about 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day from the same period last year, while its international production was down 170,000 barrels a day. Exxon's overall production in the first quarter was down about 4% compared with the prior quarter due to weather and other factors.
Chevron also missed analysts' estimates on earnings, with net income coming in about 4.5% lower than anticipated, according to FactSet.
Exxon shares slid about 2% Friday, while Chevron's fell about 3%.
Even with oil fetching more than $100 a barrel, and pressure from the Biden administration for oil companies to pump more to help ease high gasoline prices, investors have continued to push companies to remain frugal when it comes to oil-field investments. Instead, shareholders are seeking increases to dividends and buybacks after years of losing money on the sector.
Kevin Holt, senior portfolio manager at Invesco Ltd., said he doesn't want oil companies to make spending decisions based on current commodity prices, which he said will eventually decline.
""We want to make sure you stay disciplined and look at mid-cycle pricing, in terms of how you're looking at the world,"" Mr. Holt said, referring to oil prices still several years away. ""That's first and foremost.""
Exxon said it spent about $4.9 billion in capital in the first quarter, on pace with its plan to keep investments relatively modest—and far lower than the last time oil prices fetched more than $100 a barrel. Back then, in the first quarter of 2014, Exxon had invested $8.4 billion.
The company last year set a conservative budget of $20 billion to $25 billion a year through 2027, 17% to 33% lower than prepandemic plans.
Exxon generated about $10.8 billion and Chevron about $6.1 billion in free cash flow, a metric that has become of particular interest to investors after years in which U.S. oil companies made lackluster returns as they consistently overspent cash flow.
For about a decade, many companies ran up huge debt piles and spent more money than they made from actually selling oil and gas, in a bid to increase production. Since the pandemic, companies have pulled back spending and focused on sending extra cash to investors.
Oil companies are now deciding how to spend growing piles of cash. Many shale companies have opted to send most of it back to shareholders via flexible dividends and buybacks; a few have said they would increase spending and output to some extent.
For Exxon and Chevron, share repurchases have become key to its efforts to lure back investors. But even with oil vaulting above $100 a barrel, many investors are still wary of the industry following years of poor returns, executives said.
Though the energy sector has recently been outperforming the S&P 500 index, those returns follow a decade in which it fell behind the broader market, said Chevron CFO Pierre Breber.
""Shareholders in our sector have not been rewarded over the long-term,"" Mr. Breber said. ""We still have a long way to go to win back investors, and the way we're going to win [them] back is by investing capital efficiently,"" he added.

WASHINGTON -- Top oil company executives wrangled with House lawmakers Wednesday over high gasoline prices, rejecting claims by Democrats that they are taking advantage of a global crisis to gouge consumers.
Over a six-hour hearing, Democrats on a House oversight panel castigated executives from Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and other oil giants for raking in historically high profits while slowing investment in U.S. production.
The company chiefs countered that prices were driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, restrictive U.S. energy policies and supply-chain shortages slowing the industry.
""It is experiencing severe cost inflation, a labor shortage due to three downturns in 12 years, shortages of drilling rigs, frack fleets, frack sand, steel pipe and other equipment and materials,"" said Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources Co., one of the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producers. ""We can't grow faster.""
The hearing before a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, in which the executives appeared via video links, was the latest skirmish over responsibility for pump prices that lingered at record highs throughout March.
The issue has taken on added significance ahead of congressional midterm elections in November, with polls showing many worry over how the Biden administration has overseen the economy.
The committee's Republicans sought to place blame for high prices on President Biden's energy policy, including his decision to impose a temporary pause on new oil and gas leases on federal land and his revocation of a permit for the Keystone XL pipeline to carry more oil from Canada.
""We need to look for ways to increase our domestic production and our export capacity,"" said Rep. Morgan Griffith (R., Va.). ""We need energy policy that promotes energy security while also taking advantage of America's abundant energy resources.""
Democrats said oil companies have an obligation to do more for Americans and threatened to revoke tax breaks they get to encourage their production.
""Now it's time for Congress to alleviate the pain many Americans are feeling at the pump,"" said Rep. Diana DeGette (D., Colo.). ""We have the capacity right now. The reason why your companies aren't doing it, as you freely and honestly admitted, is because you're looking at your shareholder profits.""
Ms. DeGette challenged the executives to explain why retail gasoline prices are down 3.2% from last month, while crude futures are down more than 20% from recent highs.
The oil executives said pump prices are set by retailers, and that prices are a result of several factors including local wages and other operating costs.
""We do not control the price of crude oil or natural gas, nor of refined products like gasoline and diesel fuel,"" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said. ""And we have no tolerance for price gouging.""
Democrats also said the oil executives were giving priority to payouts to their shareholders over reinvesting in oil production.
They cited a survey last month from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, in which half of the big companies that responded said they didn't intend to increase output by more than 5% this year despite higher oil prices. Most respondents cited investor pressure as the top factor limiting their growth.
Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, said the six oil companies represented at the hearing, which also included BP PLC and Shell PLC, together issued about $40 billion in dividends last year and have executed or announced $45 billion in share buyback programs in 2021 and 2022.
""Now that's a lot of money to shareholders but it's coming at the expense of the American people, who need you to dramatically increase production, not shareholder wealth,"" Mr. Pallone said.
Pioneer and Devon Energy Corp., whose chief executive Richard Muncrief also testified before the panel, had earlier this year reported their highest annual profits in more than a decade.
Exxon reported $23 billion and Chevron reported nearly $16 billion in net income for 2021, both their most profitable years since 2014.

Energy giant Chevron Corp. is working to reduce operating expenses related to its production of oil and fuels and increase its output.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based oil major in January reported profit of $15.6 billion for 2021, up from a loss of $5.5 billion in 2020. It brought down costs during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its $5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy Inc. in 2020 gave Chevron additional exposure to the Permian Basin in West Texas and added several mature, less-risky assets to its portfolio. Operating expenses last year totaled $20.73 billion, down 3.1% from 2019, when the company said it would restructure its operations.
Chevron last year produced an equivalent of 3.1 million barrels of oil per day. It said it expects production to rise at a compound annual growth rate of at least 3% through 2025.
Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber discussed layoffs, cutting back on operating costs and how to get more out of its capital investments. This is the fourth part of a series that focuses on how CFOs reduce debt and other costs. Edited excerpts follow.
WSJ: What have you done to reduce expenses?
Mr. Breber: We're a much better company than we were a few years ago because we are more capital- and cost-efficient. I wouldn't necessarily call it a cut in capital, [but] an improvement in capital and cost efficiency. We can get the same business results for less capital. We gave guidance [in March] to lower our cost per barrel [of oil] by 10% over the next five years. So it's a unit cost and you can do that, both by becoming more cost efficient, but also by having underlying production growth.
WSJ: Your head count last year fell 10.8% to 42,595 compared with a year earlier. To what extent did you cut staff?
Mr. Breber: We did, as part of our enterprisewide transformation. We've been operating under the new model for more than a year. We did have reductions in staff. The majority of them were essentially voluntary and then some were involuntary.
WSJ: How much net debt do you have?
Mr. Breber: Our net debt ratio [which compares net debt to equity] at the end of [the] fourth quarter was just under 16% and it's heading down. We are generating excess cash, which is why we doubled our share buyback guidance. [Note: Chevron last year bought back $1.4 billion in shares. The company in March said it would buy back between $5 billion and $10 billion worth of stock a year.]
WSJ: How are you managing your capital investments?
Mr. Breber: Our capital expenditures are up this year by nearly 30%—to an expected $15 billion from $11.7 billion [in 2021]—and then [they] will be in a flattish range. We're clearly going to have more cost pressure. We deliberately reduced capital when Covid hit because we didn't want to add short-term supply in markets that were oversupplied. We didn't know exactly how long it was going to go on, but we expected it to get back to that prior investment level [of about $14 billion]. Now we're on that level.
Demand has bounced back faster. Supply's trying to catch up. There's been a lag and then, of course, you have geopolitical risk that has increased commodity prices in general and including oil, and it's a fast-moving environment.
WSJ: How are you affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine?
Mr. Breber: We were in a recovery even before the [Russian] war with Ukraine was under way. We do not have exploration production activities in Russia like a number of our peers do.
WSJ: Do you have tips for other CFOs on how to become more efficient?
Mr. Breber: We are a big company, but we're not everywhere and we don't do everything. We pick our spots. If you think of our downstream business, we're primarily on the U.S. West Coast, U.S. Gulf Coast and parts of Asia. That's a very focused portfolio. It's easy for companies to think you can do more than you can and that's when you tend to get cost inefficient.

CIO Journal marked its 10th anniversary on April 2. The role of the chief information officer changed dramatically during the last decade of technological upheaval, which was accelerated by the pandemic. We asked CIOs, CEOs and other leaders to share their perspective on what this disruption means for business. Here are edited highlights.
Also
How has the relationship between business and technology changed during the last 10 years?
Arvind Krishna, CEO, International Business Machines Corp.
I would say technology has gone from being a cost of doing business to one of the fundamental sources of competitive advantage. If I look at the sources of competitive advantage, 2,000 years ago it was physical resources. Then it was trading…the things you got from the land, gold, wheat, grain. Then it went to money. You then go to knowledge. Through the last century we talked about knowledge workers. Today, I think it's technology. I think tech is the fundamental source of competitive advantage today.
Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud
If you look at what has really fundamentally changed in technology, I would say it is the pervasiveness and speed with which new technology has been predominant. Part of it is the ease with which technology can now be adopted with many things being delivered, from computing as a service…Today everyone in the organization is a digital worker.
Martin Casado, general partner, Andreessen Horowitz
Ten years ago, if you started a software project, you really didn't know if you were going to complete it. It was more art than engineering. Certain people could do it and certain people couldn't, and it was hard to outsource. Now, with all of the tooling built around it, cloud, mobile, containers, all of these things…if you start a software project, it will almost certainly be completed, and it will be done better and faster than before. The question has moved from can you build it to how effective will it be.
Suresh Kumar, chief technology officer and chief development officer, Walmart Inc.
It was actually the creation of the cloud and distributed computing that…allowed us to get very powerful models. We can now collect and reason over the kinds of data that would have been unthinkable maybe about 10 years ago. And that has led to new capabilities…that couldn't have been possible, even just a few years ago.
Francesco Tinto, CIO, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.
More and more, we talk about new business models that become enabled by technology…how we create the experience for the user, the experience for the external customer, and more importantly, how we create value from the data…the combination of internal and external data, structured data and unstructured data.
Ron Guerrier, CIO, HP Inc.
Enterprise technology has become more distributed. In the past, we functioned in a homogenous environment where one system did everything, and now it's a combination of solutions. That's why it's important for CIOs to hire and cultivate talent who can connect the dots in a heterogenous model.
Alessandro Ventura, CIO and vice president of analytics and business services, Unilever North America
What has happened in the last couple of years has been the advent of platforms, and on these platforms you can create products in a more agile way, so they're a much more open ecosystem…You can get different software vendors to talk to each other. Integration is more turnkey.
Bill Braun, CIO, Chevron Corp.
The rapid, low-cost, highly capable sensors appearing everywhere on everything all the time…You can't buy a motor or a valve or anything anymore that doesn't have six different sensors on it. And so that data flow that's coming from the front edge of our business, and how to harness it…that's kind of like the Wild West to us. That's where you need the cloud. You need the compute. You need the AI to make sense of it.
Noelle Eder, Global CIO, Cigna Corp.
There's way more connectivity across companies, ecosystem to ecosystem now than there was 10 years ago. So this notion of sharing customers, sharing data, sharing experiences, and thinking of your technology environment as beyond the traditional borders, is dominant right now. You can see it show up from a risk-management standpoint in cybersecurity and supply chain. There's a lot of interdependency happening.
Atish Banerjea, CIO, Meta Platforms Inc.
Wherever there are big transformation programs that are happening in any sort of large enterprise today, you cannot really think of accomplishing that without the IT organization being the heart and center of it. As opposed to IT being a back-office function that was on the periphery, it has become the heart of how the company does almost anything, whether it's in the world of marketing or sales or finance. And that's a big change.
Ramon Richards, CIO, Fannie Mae
The CIO role today…is driven by a heightened focus on resiliency, information security, and data loss prevention. Businesses depend on technology as an integral part of how they operate and a key component for growth…As a result, the CIO will be responsible for highly reliable, resilient capabilities and partnering with chief information security officers and chief data officers to ensure preventative and detective controls are in place to protect technology assets from bad actors.
How have the roles of CIO and technology leader evolved?
Andreessen Horowitz's Mr. Casado
The CIO has become more, much more strategic. As a result, two big things happened. More and more is going under the CIO because more and more is digital. But as part of that, they also have to be on top of all the recent trends, which are changing faster than ever. I think at this point the role of the CIO is about understanding how large swaths of the company's business are going to be impacted by software in the next 10 years, rather than being about the purchasing of systems.
Google Cloud's Mr. Kurian
It's a great opportunity for CIOs. Technology adoption is becoming much easier so they can show value more quickly. The pandemic made it even more clear that technology is critical to differentiating how an organization [engages with] customers. And so the role of the CIO has changed materially because it allows them to adopt technology, work with the line of business leader and deliver transformation much more quickly than before. CIOs are not just managing a portfolio of applications…they are also building competency in software engineering, in areas like cybersecurity.
Jacqueline Guichelaar, CIO, Cisco Systems Inc.
I would say it was becoming less technical to some extent, and the discussion around CIOs becoming more business oriented,…[as in] what are you actually doing for your customers? What are you doing for your business? The whole piece around keeping your team motivated from one challenge to the next while keeping the business running. We went from the pandemic, to responses to Russia-Ukraine. You're trying to hire and retain during the Great Resignation, and at the same time, we're re-engineering all of our systems. The CIO…is now the chief culture officer.
How has the CEO's relationship to the CIO changed?
IBM's Mr. Krishna
I think 10 years ago, many business leaders would feel perfectly competent to make a decision, and then the CIO would [execute it]. Now, even in my own process—I am a reasonable technologist—I would not make a decision without asking my CIO, ""What do you think? What does your team think? What do you and your team think is the best answer?""
Ten years ago, we were all looking to optimize that [IT budget], squeeze it down by 10%. Now I actually don't care if you spend more, if that makes everyone else more productive. If you can do something that lets me scale revenue faster—because I can't hire more people, they just aren't available to hire—then that is incredibly useful and valuable. So the CIO is really a partner now, no longer the cost function that I have got to irritatingly pay heed to.
Google Cloud's Mr. Kurian
CEOs see that being a technology-enabled organization requires them to have some core competencies, and one of them is software development. And so we see CIOs also needing to build that long-term core competency and people capability.
How will enterprise technology and the role of the CIO change in the foreseeable future?
IBM's Mr. Krishna
Cybersecurity is the issue of the decade. I think that is the single biggest issue we all are going to face.
Walmart's Mr. Kumar
First, I think the capabilities of devices that are in people's hands…that is going to continue to have a very important, outsized impact on enterprise tech as a whole. The second thing is that these deep-learning models are going to get increasingly sophisticated. Enterprise tech is going to be deeply influenced by the ability to create these models and to be able to run compute and have intelligence at the edge.
HP's Mr. Guerrier
I expect the next generation of CIOs to be more diverse. Since the recent racial reckoning, many companies, including HP, recommitted themselves to advance diversity, equity and inclusion and launched goals to increase diverse representation. Setting measurable outcomes will lead to progress over time. As the CIO role becomes more strategic to the business and as our society becomes more heterogeneous, diversity will be increasingly important because it drives innovation and leads to business growth.
Matt Carey, CIO, Home Depot Inc.
Robotics is going to be key, as time goes on, and they become more and more mature. The application of artificial intelligence and machine learning in ways that actually enhance customers' experiences or associate experiences are going to be very key. The value of where we can apply technology to help save our customers time and money will be an important thing, no matter what business you're in.
Anil Bhatt, Global CIO, Anthem Inc.
The telehealth expansion with the focus on [augmented reality and virtual reality] is going to be very, very important.
Fred Killeen, vice president of global information technology and CIO, General Motors Co.
One of the key things for vehicle manufacturers is going from what, historically, has been a very physical process, building vehicles…to really moving to a full virtual process, which will speed the time to market.
Kathryn Guarini, CIO, IBM
Some technologies, including AI and blockchain, have been slower to drive change than they were predicted to. I think there's tremendous capabilities in both…in terms of real business impact. I think there's more to come. It's not any one entity that can deploy blockchain and have it be widely adopted. It requires both technology and business model changes that I think make it more challenging to drive. And I think quantum computing is going to emerge as being an essential component of enterprise technology…across industries like financial services, energy, utilities.

HOUSTON -- For months, Biden administration officials snubbed top executives and lobbyists for Chevron Corp. who had pressed officials in Washington to ease sanctions so the company could boost production in Venezuela, where the U.S. has banned such activities since 2019.
Then Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.
Now the Biden administration is listening closely to Chevron, said people familiar with the conversations, which says it can help double Venezuela's 800,000 barrels-a-day production within months. That could replace the loss of roughly 700,000 barrels a day the U.S. was importing from Russia before it attacked Ukraine. And it could help lower gasoline prices -- a major concern for the Biden administration in a tough election year.
""Chevron came in November, they pitched it around, but got laughed out of town,"" said Juan Cruz, a former National Security Council official in charge of the Western Hemisphere who has closely followed the Biden administration's policy toward Venezuela. ""But what was really funny in November is a plan today.""
Since the Russians invaded on Feb. 24 and President Biden canceled Russian oil imports, Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has offered the company's help to Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm in shoring up U.S. energy supplies by ramping up production in Venezuela, people briefed on the talks said. Chevron is the only major U.S. producer to retain assets in Venezuela following nationalizations by the Socialist government and, much later, U.S. sanctions.
Granting the San Ramon, Calif., company and other U.S. producers permits to operate could boost Venezuelan production while keeping other sanctions in effect. Broadly easing sanctions on Venezuela faces stiff opposition in the U.S. over concerns it would prop up the country's autocratic regime. U.S. officials are divided over the issue, people familiar with the situation said.
Asked recently by CNN about the outreach to Venezuela and Saudi Arabia for more oil, Ms. Granholm, said, ""I think Americans should see the administration calling right now for an increase in supply as something that helps them,"" naming the benefit of reducing costs at the pump.
Shortly after Mr. Wirth talked to the energy secretary, three senior U.S. officials -- Juan Gonzalez, the senior National Security Council official in charge of Latin America; James Story, the U.S. ambassador to Venezuela; and Roger D. Carstens, a special envoy -- flew to Caracas on March 5 and met with President Nicolas Maduro and other top Venezuelan officials.
Another person who spoke with senior Venezuelan officials after the invasion was Ali Moshiri, a charismatic Iranian-American who had headed Chevron's Latin America division and was considered a ""dear friend"" by the late Hugo Chavez, the founder of the political movement now led by Mr. Maduro, with whom Mr. Moshiri also has close a close relationship. Mr. Moshiri retired from Chevron in 2017 but now consults for the company in Venezuela, where he has deep ties with senior officials, people familiar with the matter said.
Many oil industry executives said Mr. Moshiri was essential to Chevron's controversial decision to stay in the country even as other Western oil companies exited after the Venezuelan government in 2007 nationalized billions of dollars of assets owned by ConocoPhillips, Exxon Mobil Corp. and others.He has also lobbied Biden officials to loosen sanctions on Venezuela, where Chevron has operated for nearly a century.
""You cannot ignore Venezuela,"" Mr. Moshiri said in an interview last week. ""Venezuela will always be part of our energy security.""
The White House declined to comment about Chevron's possible role or its own talks in Venezuela. The Energy Department declined to comment.
People briefed on the talks said Mr. Moshiri has argued to U.S. officials thatthe U.S. can't cede influence of Venezuelan energy to rivals like China and Russia, which have increased activities in the country in recent years.
A Chevron spokesman said Mr. Moshiri isn't representing the company. Mr. Moshiri declined to provide details about his contract with Chevron."

He has also spoken with Venezuelan officials for months to try to win the release of Americans imprisoned in Venezuela, these people said.
A Chevron spokesman said Mr. Moshiri isn't representing the company in negotiations with the U.S. or with Venezuelan officials. Mr. Moshiri declined to provide details about his contract with Chevron. After leaving Chevron, he founded a firm, Amos Global Energy, which seeks investment opportunities in Venezuela, people familiar with the matter said.
A few days after the March 5 meeting in Caracas with U.S. officials, the Maduro government freed two American captives , one of them an executive of Citgo, the U.S. refining subsidiary of state-run oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PdVSA. The government also agreed to restart negotiations in Mexico with representatives of Venezuela's opposition, who want officials to agree to free and fair presidential elections in 2024.
News of the meeting in Caracas, though, has caused a political backlash in Washington and in Florida, where exiled Venezuelans live and have forged links to the state's powerful and conservative Cuban American community.
""The democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people, much like the resolve and courage of the people of Ukraine, are worth much more than a few thousand barrels of oil,"" New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, wrote in a statement. Those sentiments were echoed by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers in Florida.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, whom the U.S. recognizes as Venezuela's legitimate president, was told of the U.S.-Venezuela meeting after it had taken place. Mr. Guaidó wrote a letter to Mr. Biden, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, saying that lifting sanctions on Venezuela would do little to ease the world's crude supply shortages while rewarding Mr. Maduro, a Putin ally whose rule is blamed for leading six million Venezuelans to flee the country.
""Today, more than ever we should be firm and morally consistent,"" said Mr. Guaidó in a video press conference from Caracas last week. He said any lifting of sanctions on Venezuela or permission for Chevron to pump oil there should only come in exchange for democratic concessions by the regime.
Answering reporters' questions last week White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, ""There is no dialogue between us and the regime."" She said the administration would consider lifting sanctions on the basis of progress in talks between Mr. Maduro and the opposition.
Chevron officials still say the company could win a license permitting it, along with European oil companies such as Eni SpA and Repsol SA, to operate in Venezuela.
Venezuela claims to have the world's largest proven oil reserves. But years of mismanagement, corruption and nationalization of oil ventures led production to fall from 3.2 million barrels a day in the 1990s to a 10th of that in 2020. Since then, production has more than doubled as Venezuela turned to opaque foreign companies to boost production, say industry executives. Chevron's lobbyists assert that the recent production increases show that the U.S. sanctions aren't working as intended.
But while Chevron has told U.S. officials it could boost production quickly, some oil analysts who closely track Venezuela doubt the company could deliver . Even in good times, Venezuela had never increased production anywhere near the level of recent optimistic projections, according to Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute.
Chevron's perseverance in Venezuela has come as the company has tried to get Venezuela to pay money owed under production-sharing agreements. The company wrote down all of its assets there in 2020, taking a charge of $2.6 billion. Nonetheless, it stayed, receiving periodic licenses from the U.S. government to retain but not operate assets.

More than 500 Chevron Corp. employees went on strike at a refinery in California on Monday amid a contract stalemate.
The strike comes after the company's contract with the United Steelworkers Local 5 union expired Feb. 1, according to the United Steelworkers.
Union members at the Bay Area plant had been working on a rolling extension ahead of the strike.
""USW members continued to report for work throughout the pandemic so our nation could meet its energy needs,"" said Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers' National Oil Bargaining Program. ""They deserve a fair contract that reflects their sacrifice.""
The Richmond refinery has about 3,000 total employees, according to Chevron.
The company said the contract it is offering workers is competitive, fair and responsive to the union's concerns.
""We have negotiated in good faith for months, reaching two tentative agreements that were rejected by the union, and we are ready to continue discussions with USW so we can reach an equitable agreement,"" Chevron said in a statement.
The strike comes amid surging gasoline prices across the U.S.
In California, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline is at $5.855 a gallon, the highest in the country, according to AAA.
Chevron said it is prepared to continue its normal operations and doesn't expect supply-chain problems. It wouldn't say whether gas prices would be affected.
The broader United Steelworkers reached a pattern agreement with the oil industry about a month ago, but the individual units bargain over local issues as well, according to the union.
Chevron said United Steelworkers Local 5's demands were more than what the company considers reasonable and went beyond the national pattern bargaining agreement.
The Chevron strike is the latest in a string of high-profile strikes that have swept the country over the past several months.
Workers at Deere & Co., Mondelez International Inc. and Kellogg Co. ended up accepting new contracts that included pay raises, among other provisions."

More than 500 Chevron Corp. employees went on strike at a refinery in California on Monday amid a contract stalemate.
The strike comes after the company's contract with the United Steelworkers Local 5 union expired Feb. 1, according to the United Steelworkers. Union members at the Bay Area plant had been working on a rolling extension and ahead of the strike.
""USW members continued to report for work throughout the pandemic so our nation could meet its energy needs,"" said Mike Smith, chair of the United Steelworkers' National Oil Bargaining Program. ""They deserve a fair contract that reflects their sacrifice.""
The Richmond refinery has about 3,000 total employees, according to Chevron.
Chevron said the contract it is offering workers is competitive, fair and responsive to the union's concerns.
""We have negotiated in good faith for months, reaching two tentative agreements that were rejected by the union, and we are ready to continue discussions with USW so we can reach an equitable agreement,"" Chevron said in a statement.
The strike comes amid surging gasoline prices across the U.S. In California, the average price of regular unleaded gasoline is at $5.855 a gallon, the highest in the country, according to AAA . Chevron said it is prepared to continue its normal operations and doesn't expect supply-chain problems. It wouldn't say whether gas prices would be affected.
The broader United Steelworkers reached a pattern agreement with the oil industry about a month ago, but the individual units bargain over local issues as well, according to the union.
Chevron said United Steelworkers Local 5's demands were more than what the company considers reasonable and went beyond the national pattern bargaining agreement.
The Chevron strike is the latest in a string of high-profile strikes that have swept the country over the past several months. Workers at Deere & Co., Mondelez International Inc. and Kellogg Co. ended up accepting new contracts that included pay raises, among other provisions.

Chevron Corp. is making one of its largest investments in renewable fuels, paying $3.15 billion to buy a company that makes diesel and other fuels from sources such as corn or cooking oil as the fossil-fuel giant faces investor pressure to invest in green energy.
The purchase of Iowa-based Renewable Energy Group Inc., which has 11 refineries that source mainly from waste products such as tallow or used cooking oil, will help Chevron in its quest to offer a bigger variety of fuels with lower carbon footprints than oil and natural gas. Chevron plans to continue making acquisitions in the area, and will spend money to convert existing refineries so they can process low-carbon fuel sources, Chief Executive Mike Wirth said.
""We're creating a system here, not just buying a business to plug in,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""It is building capabilities to do things that are very analogous to what we've historically done, with a wide variety of feedstocks.""
In a sign of the importance of the Renewable Energy Group deal, Chevron said REG's president and chief executive, Cynthia J. Warner, is expected to join Chevron's board, and Chevron's renewable-fuels business will move its headquarters to Iowa.
The REG acquisition comes as Chevron, along with other big oil-and-gas companies, faces intense pressure to overhaul their businesses to reduce the fossil-fuel-generated carbon emissions that are a main contributor to global warming. Chevron said last year it will triple spending on its low-carbon unit, pledging to spend $10 billion through 2028 on biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies, up from a prior commitment of roughly $3 billion.
Part of Chevron's strategy is to boost production of renewable fuels: gas, diesel and oil typically made from organic or waste materials that generate less carbon dioxide over the course of their manufacturing and consumption than fossil fuels.
The company said last year that it hopes to produce 100,000 barrels of renewable diesel by 2030. That is a volume big enough to supply California-based Chevron's current diesel customers on the U.S. West Coast, which is implementing some of the country's most aggressive clean-fuel programs.
The Renewable Energy Group acquisition will help meet that goal because REG has a renewable-diesel facility that it is expanding to a capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, said Mark Nelson, Chevron's executive vice president in charge of its downstream and chemicals business, who is overseeing the renewable-fuels push.
Chevron is also pouring money into renewable gas, initially by tying up with companies that produce the fuel from dairy-cow manure.

 Chevron to Buy Biofuel Company for $3.15 Billion"
2484702332,2-Feb-21,"Oil Companies Endure Brutal 2020, Warn of Slow 2021 Recovery; Exxon, BP and others notched one of their worst annual performances as the pandemic crushed demand for fossil fuels",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/californias-green-energy-subsidies-spur-gold-rush/docview/2630504900/se-2?accountid=7064,CVX,"Clean Energy Fuels Corp., a major distributor of natural gas made from waste, found a way to boost its earnings by millions of dollars, virtually overnight.
All it had to do was switch the main biofuel it supplies to power cars and trucks in California—currently a type of natural gas produced with methane emissions from garbage—to a chemically identical gas produced from the manure of cows.
California's clean-fuels grading system gives cow-poop gas a much better score—and much higher subsidies—than landfill gas. So that simple substitution could net Clean Energy an additional $70 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2026, the company estimates.
Together with European energy giants BP PLC and TotalEnergies SE, Clean Energy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into gas production on dairy farms to milk that advantage. A host of developers, financiers and carbon-conscious corporations, from Chevron Corp. to Amazon.com Inc., are looking to buy or produce the fuel as well.
""It is like magic,"" said Andrew Littlefair, Clean Energy's president and chief executive, of the projected earnings boost.
The surging interest in dairy renewable natural gas, as it is called, shows how incentives can spur action to address the emissions linked to climate change—and sometimes unintended consequences as well. Until a few years ago, the gas, which is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and can replace dirtier fuels like diesel, was a niche product that was too expensive to make commercially.
Now, California's generous subsidies have prompted what some observers are dubbing a manure gold rush. One developer said he showed up at a dairy only to discover that the farmer had gotten more than 10 pitches for business tie-ups already. Others said competition for business has gotten so heated that some developers are promising to pay farmers a fixed amount per cow—a risky setup if the price of the California credits plummets.
Driving the boom is California's Low-Carbon Fuel Standard. The standard requires companies that sell transportation fuels in the state to lower their products' carbon intensity —the carbon dioxide emitted during manufacture, distribution and consumption. Companies that exceed the carbon-intensity maximums have to buy offset credits, each of which represents a metric ton of emissions. Those with low-scoring fuels generate credits, whose price goes up and down depending on demand.
The lowest carbon-intensity scores go to fuels that keep warming gases out of the air—particularly methane, a greenhouse gas that can be 84 times more potent in trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that helps the United Nations evaluate the state of research on the issue.
Other waste sources such as landfills produce methane, too. But California already requires landfills to curb methane emissions while farms don't have to, and thus they emit more. So capturing the methane from decomposing manure at dairies to make truck fuel cuts net emissions a lot, and reaps some of the best scores of all.
U.S. regulators haven't generally imposed controls on methane emissions from livestock, since they are tough to implement and politically sensitive.
California Bioenergy LLC, which develops projects to make energy out of manure, in 2016 received the first provisional carbon-intensity score—around negative 270—for a dairy-gas facility. Diesel by comparison has an average carbon-intensity score of more than 100. CalBio, as it is known, now has 41 dairy-gas projects in operation and another 60-odd projects in development.
Its latest project to go online is the 1,500-cow Rib-Arrow Dairy in central California, where manure is now flushed from the floor of the stalls into a covered lagoon, called a digester, so the methane can be collected for processing rather than released into the air. That raw biogas, which is around 60% methane and the remainder mostly carbon dioxide, is piped to a central facility that collects gas from a cluster of dairies in the area and purifies it for injection into the local utility's pipeline.
David Ribeiro, a third-generation co-owner of Rib-Arrow, said he had been approached by digester salesmen before, but that adding the gas sales to the environmental benefits finally made everything economically feasible: ""We're like, 'Wow, this makes sense.'""
There are 116 such facilities currently operating in the U.S.—more than half of which went online last year—and another 121 planned or in construction, according to the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas, a nonprofit that promotes gas made from waste. Analysts say thousands more dairies could support such plants, which can reduce foul odors in addition to capturing emissions.
The market is likely to remain small compared with the U.S.'s overall appetite for natural gas in homes, businesses and transport. Even in an optimistic scenario, biogas from manure would supply only around 3% of today's demand by 2040, according to a 2019 study commissioned by the American Gas Foundation.
Still, money is pouring in from big companies looking to lower their carbon footprints quickly—as well as entrepreneurs smelling a business opportunity. Clean Energy said it is working on more than a billion dollars worth of deals through its dairy-gas joint ventures with BP and Total, and that it hopes to channel more than $2 billion in investment by 2026.
California-based Chevron has committed around $500 million to develop renewable natural-gas supply, starting with dairies. A Chevron investor presentation in September showed plans for a national network of as many as ""190,000 milking cow equivalents"" and forecast double-digit returns. Amazon has inked a deal with Clean Energy to buy biogas for its massive trucking fleet; it declined to comment.
More than half of California's methane is released from dairy and livestock manure, and by cow burps. The state has vowed to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by 2030, and it is focusing on methane reductions in particular. It is also targeting a 20% reduction in the carbon intensity of its transportation fuel relative to 2010, and has so far managed to cut it by more than 7%.
""From our perspective, the program is working to drive private investment"" to accomplish the state's environmental goals, said Matthew Botill, the division chief at California's Air Resources Board who oversees the state's low-carbon fuel standard and other climate change programs.
California officials said the program doesn't cost the state money because its market-based mechanism results in producers and consumers of higher-carbon fuels effectively paying the incentives to the producers and consumers of low-carbon fuels.
Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia are implementing similar fuel standards, and a number of other states are considering them, too. The federal government issues its own, less-lucrative, subsidies for low-carbon fuels.
California's aggressive incentive system is producing some odd results. One dairy that was already using digesters to collect methane and produce electricity from its manure—the 35,000-cow Threemile Canyon Farms in Oregon—got a relatively high carbon-intensity score of negative 189 when it shifted to making gas for California, since it had fewer emissions to reduce.
""The manure management practices on the farm were so good…that they were penalized a bit,"" said Ben Vitale, CEO of Resilient Infrastructure Group, which owns Threemile's gas plant.
Financiers at Cresta Fund Management, a Texas-based private-equity fund that has two renewable natural gas producers in its portfolio, said they have seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs with little experience in the area trying to raise money for dairy-gas projects.
""We had some authors pitch us,"" said John Skrinar, Cresta's director of sustainable investments. ""The reality is, it's a lot more complicated than just show up, put a swimming pool in the ground, shovel a bunch of cow manure into it, and make a fortune.""

Exxon Mobil Corp. reported on Tuesday $23 billion in profit for 2021, its highest total since 2014, including $8.9 billion in profit in the fourth quarter. Last week, Chevron Corp. reported its most profitable year since 2014, earning $15.6 billion in net income in 2021 and $5.1 billion in the fourth quarter. The largest European oil companies, Shell PLC and BP PLC, are expected to also post resurgent annual results when they report in the coming days.
Exxon and Chevron are predicting a multiyear upswing for the industry as oil and gas demand surges from the depths of the pandemic and investment in new production slows. The strong results have lured investors to a sector many left for dead.
The S&P 500 Energy Sector is up around 23% so far this year while the broader S&P 500 is down about 5%. Over the last 12 months, shares of the largest Western oil companies have all risen sharply. Exxon is up about 80%, Chevron is up 56%, while Shell and BP are up 39% and 43%, respectively. Exxon's shares jumped about 6% Tuesday, while Chevron's shares hit an all-time high last week.
""Our effective pandemic response, focused investments during the down cycle and structural cost savings positioned us to realize the full benefit of the market recovery last year,"" Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said.
The companies are benefiting from rapidly rising commodity prices as demand for some fuels, including U.S. gasoline consumption, has topped pre-pandemic levels. Crucially for investors, many of the companies are sticking to pledges to moderate their growth and return more cash to shareholders.
Chevron said last week that it generated $21.1 billion in free cash flow in 2021, its most ever. But it isn't planning to plow most of it back into new oil and gas production, and expects its output could decline slightly in 2022. Instead, it boosted its dividend by 6% and said it would buy back as much as $5 billion of its stock this year.
Exxon said it generated $48 billion in cash flow from operations in 2021, its most since 2012. Analysts expect it to raise its dividend later this year, and Exxon has said it would buy back as much as $10 billion in shares over the next 12 to 24 months.
Western oil companies have historically heavily reinvested cash in increasing oil reserves and production, a strategy that produced paltry profits over the past decade. Investors turned their back on the industry before the spread of Covid-19 and fled the space when the virus took hold. Chevron's and Exxon's shares fell nearly 50% in March 2020.
""The growth experiment is over,"" said Jeff Wyll, senior energy analyst at Neuberger Berman. ""Many of the leading companies have taken aggressive steps to win back investors.""
But what has benefited investors might not help consumers. U.S. oil prices were trading at around $88 a barrel Tuesday. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said last week that oil prices could top $100 per barrel in 2022. U.S. gasoline prices have reached their highest levels since 2014, averaging about $3.32 last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Exxon and Chevron have both said they would stick to more modest spending levels they laid out last year. Exxon plans to boost its 2022 capital spending by $4 billion to $7 billion from last year's low levels. Even with the increase, Exxon's planned capital investments through 2027 are down 17% to 33% from its pre-pandemic plans. Chevron's planned capital expenditures for 2022 are down about 26% from its previous plans, while European oil companies have also said they would invest more conservatively in oil and gas production.
Exxon's oil and gas production unit had a turnaround in 2021, earning $15.8 billion in profit, compared with a $20 billion loss in 2020. Exxon has focused its investments in Guyana, where it made six additional oil discoveries in 2021, and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where Exxon said it increased its oil and gas production by nearly 100,000 barrels a day last year and will boost it a further 25% in 2022.
Both Chevron and Exxon plan to boost spending this year in some areas, including the Permian Basin, where shale wells produce rapidly, giving them flexibility to respond to higher prices. But overall, Exxon produced less oil and gas in 2021 than it did before the pandemic, while Chevron's production is up slightly. Combined, the two companies represent about 6% of global oil supply.
The lower spending levels could lead to an even tighter oil and gas market in 2022, especially if the global economic recovery continues. Mr. Wirth said last week that some areas of fossil fuel demand, like jet fuel, have yet to recover.
""Even with the robust demand recovery that we've seen, there is still another leg to the demand improvement that is likely to occur here in 2022,"" Mr. Wirth said on a call with analysts. ""The issues, frankly, have been a little bit more on the supply side than the demand side.""
Besides austerity pledges oil companies have made to shareholders, they are under pressure from climate activists and environmentally minded investors to invest less in production. Exxon lost three seats on its board of directors at its shareholder meeting last May to hedge fund Engine No. 1, which argued that the energy company needs to invest in clean energy and stop funding high-risk megaprojects that produce poor returns.
Last month, Exxon set a goal to reduce or offset greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations to zero by 2050. The goal doesn't cover emissions from use of its products, which make up most of the emissions connected to the company."

But it isn't planning to plow most of it back into new oil and gas production, and expects its output could decline slightly in 2022. Instead, it increased its dividend by 6% and said it would buy back as much as $5 billion of its stock this year.
Exxon said it generated $48 billion in cash flow from operations in 2021, its most since 2012. Analysts expect it to raise its dividend later this year, and Exxon has said it would buy back as much as $10 billion in shares over the next 12 to 24 months.
The moves to return more money to shareholders instead of putting most of it back into new projects represent a reversal for Western oil companies, which have historically heavily reinvested cash in increasing oil reserves and production, a strategy that produced paltry profits over the past decade. Investors turned their back on the industry before the spread of Covid-19 and fled the space when the virus took hold. Chevron and Exxon's shares fell nearly 50% in March 2020.
""The growth experiment is over,"" said Jeff Wyll, senior energy analyst at Neuberger Berman. ""Many of the leading companies have taken aggressive steps to win back investors.""
But what has benefited investors may not help consumers confronting rising energy prices. U.S. oil prices were trading at around $88 a barrel Tuesday. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said last week that oil prices could top $100 per barrel in 2022. U.S. gasoline prices have reached their highest levels since 2014, averaging about $3.32 last week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Exxon and Chevron have both said they would stick to more modest spending levels they laid out last year. Exxon plans to increase its 2022 capital spending by $4 billion to $7 billion from last year's low levels. Even with the increase, Exxon's planned capital investments through 2027 are down 17% to 33% from its pre-pandemic plans. Chevron's planned capital expenditures for 2022 are down about 26% from its previous plans, while European oil companies have also said they would invest more conservatively in oil and gas production.
Exxon said Monday it is moving its corporate headquarters from Irving, Texas, to Houston as part of a business reorganization that the company said will yield $6 billion in structural cost savings by 2023.
Exxon's oil and gas production unit had a turnaround in 2021, earning $15.8 billion in profit, up from a $20 billion loss in 2020. The company has focused its investments in Guyana, where it made six additional oil discoveries in 2021, and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where Exxon said it increased its oil and gas production by nearly 100,000 barrels a day last year and will boost it another 25% in 2022.
When including other interests that Exxon owns but doesn't control, it earned $23.6 billion in 2021 and $9.1 billion in the fourth quarter.
Both Chevron and Exxon plan to increase spending this year in some areas, including the Permian Basin, where shale wells produce rapidly, giving the companies flexibility to respond to higher prices. But overall, Exxon produced less oil and gas in 2021 than it did before the pandemic, while Chevron's production is up slightly. Combined, the two companies represent about 6% of global oil supply.
The lower spending levels could lead to an even tighter oil and gas market in 2022, especially if the global economic recovery continues. Mr. Wirth said last week that some areas of fossil fuel demand, like jet fuel, have yet to recover.
""Even with the robust demand recovery that we've seen, there is still another leg to the demand improvement that is likely to occur here in 2022,"" Mr. Wirth said on a call with analysts. ""The issues, frankly, have been a little bit more on the supply side than the demand side.""
It remains to be seen whether the companies will ever return to the kind of multibillion-dollar oil and gas megaprojects that were once their bread and butter, which take years to build and years more to deliver a return on investment.
In addition to the austerity pledges companies have made to shareholders, oil companies are under pressure from climate activists and environmentally-minded investors to invest less in production. Exxon lost three seats on its board of directors at its annual shareholder meeting last May to the hedge fund Engine No. 1, which argued that the energy company needs to invest in clean energy and stop funding high-risk megaprojects that produce poor returns.
Last month, Exxon set a goal to reduce or offset greenhouse-gas emissions from its operations to zero by 2050. The goal doesn't cover emissions from use of its products, such as gasoline or natural gas burned in homes, which make up most of the emissions connected to the company.
Chris Ailman, chief investment officer of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, praised Exxon's net zero target but said it should have included the emissions from its products. Mr. Ailman said he is pushing the company to avoid massive, high-cost oil projects. The pension fund, the nation's second largest, supported the Engine No. 1 campaign.
""Chasing reserves in risky locales is not what they need to be doing,"" said Mr. Ailman.

 Exxon, Chevron Hit Gushers of Cash as Big Oil Companies Lure Back Investors"
2483968356,30-Jan-21,"Chevron posts fourth-quarter loss on weak refining, deal charges",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/exchange-heard-on-street-chevron-still-has-plenty/docview/2623530479/se-2?accountid=7064,CVX,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Chevron was off to a great start in 2022, but investors suddenly see its barrel as only half full.
The company started the year off with a bang, with its shares touching a record high on Thursday after it announced a 6% hike to its dividend, which is more generous than the 4% analysts had expected. Rival Exxon Mobil kept its payout unchanged on the same day but is expected to raise it later.
But Chevron's shares dropped sharply after full-year results were unveiled Friday morning. Despite reporting its best year of earnings since 2014, when oil prices were $100 a barrel on average, Chevron's numbers weren't quite strong enough to sustain the excitement.
The company announced Friday that it generated $29.2 billion worth of cash flow from operations in 2021, almost three times what it did in the bruising year that was 2020. It was nevertheless about $2 billion short of what analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected. Chevron typically maximizes cash generation during good years: In 2018, when oil prices were -- on an annual basis -- similar to 2021, the company generated more than $30 billion of cash flow from operations.
Most of the disappointment seems to have had rather boring administrative roots, not fundamental causes. On an earnings call on Friday, Chevron executives chalked the lower-than-expected cash flow to slow federal tax refunds and some international contracts where additional taxes kick in when oil and liquefied-natural-gas prices surge. Additionally, those higher LNG prices in the fourth quarter were something of a mixed bag: Chevron didn't quite get to benefit from all the price upside because more customers opted to take delivery through contracts, making fewer cargoes available for spot sales.
Chevron should be a reliable cash gusher the rest of the year as long as oil prices hold up to expectations; some on Wall Street are calling for them to reach $100 a barrel by the summer. But bullish oil forecasts can't always be trusted, so what will really set companies apart this year is their ability to return cash to shareholders, no matter what the oil price. In 2021, Chevron reinvested roughly 28% of its operating cash flow back into its business, devoting another 40% to dividends and buybacks. That is quite the switch from historical norms, when it almost always overspent on capital expenditures compared with shareholder returns. Based on Friday's guidance, the company is slated to return more than 42% of operating cash flow to shareholders this year and could do even better since it has the strongest balance sheet among peers.
Despite trading near historic highs, Chevron's shares remain cheap. Its enterprise value as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is about 6% below that of rival Exxon. That gives it plenty of fuel for the road ahead."

Chevron Corp. had its most profitable year since 2014, reporting Friday that it earned $15.6 billion in net income in 2021, as commodity prices surged on the back of a global economic recovery.
The U.S. oil giant's annual earnings were a dramatic turnaround from 2020, when Chevron lost $5.5 billion after the global pandemic routed demand for oil and gas. It reported a fourth-quarter profit of $5.1 billion Friday, up from a $665 million loss during the same period last year. Chevron also said it generated $21.1 billion in free cash flow in 2021, its most ever.
Chevron's stock price reached its highest level ever Thursday, closing at more than $135 a share, as investors reacted to Chevron's announcement that it would raise its quarterly dividend by 6%. But the shares fell 3.5% Friday following the fourth-quarter earnings, which were lower than analysts had expected.
Surging commodity prices have left investors wondering whether oil-and-gas companies will follow their historical impulse to increase drilling in pursuit of higher profits. Chevron is the first of the largest Western oil companies to report earnings, and analysts will look for tea leaves from Chevron's management about whether the price signal has changed its calculus.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said demand for gasoline is above pre-pandemic levels and that he expects further recovery in fossil markets in 2022. Despite that, he said Chevron will stick to disciplined spending.
""I don't think we're going to be tempted by the price of the day,"" Mr. Wirth said on a call with analysts Friday.
Following years of dismal returns from oil-and-gas companies, investors have pressured producers to moderate growth and return more cash to shareholders. Chevron and peers have responded by changing how they allocate cash, leading to a jump in their share prices and declines in the cost of capital, according to Rob Thummel, a senior portfolio manager at TortoiseEcofin.
While that is good for investors in the company, there are mounting concerns that there isn't enough investment in new fossil-fuel supply to meet growing demand.
""Producers and management teams will continue to deliver on what the market is asking them, which is to return capital to shareholders, ultimately making it harder to keep up with global demand for oil and gas,"" said Mr. Thummel.
U.S. oil prices reached their highest levels since 2014 in January and were trading at around $87 per barrel Thursday. More analysts are predicting that oil prices will top $100 per barrel in 2022, as global economies continue to recover.
Chevron has said it is sticking to a relatively modest budget and will return increasing amounts of cash to shareholders. The dividend increase marked the 35th consecutive year it has raised the payout. Chevron has also said it would buy back as much as $5 billion of its stock after buying back $1.4 billion in 2021.
The company said it set a record for oil and gas output in 2021, producing 3.1 million barrels a day, a modest rise from the prior year's levels."

Late Thursday, a federal judge invalidated a U.S. oil and gas lease sale of 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico, saying the Department of Interior hadn't adequately considered climate change impacts in its environmental analysis. Chevron was among the companies that had bid for tracts in the sale. Mr. Wirth called the decision disappointing on Friday.
Chevron said in December it would increase capital expenditures in 2022 to $15 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year but still well below pre-pandemic levels. Mr. Breber said the company will maintain that budget. Chevron has said it would spend between $15 billion and $17 billion through 2025 compared with previous plans to spend $19 billion to $22 billion a year before the pandemic.
Despite the lower spending levels, Chevron said it set a record for oil and gas production in 2021, producing 3.1 million barrels a day, a modest increase from the prior year's levels. The company's oil-and-gas production unit earned $7.3 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020.
Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said the company can grow production despite its more disciplined spending because of structural cost savings Chevron implemented during the pandemic. Chevron has to grow to sustain the dividend, he said.
""We're going to build back activity as the market recovers,"" Mr. Breber said.
Phil Gresh, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to investors Friday that Chevron's guidance that 2022 oil and gas production would be flat to slightly down was lower than expected. Mr. Breber said Chevron's 2022 production would grow, excluding lost volumes from expiring contracts in Asia.

A federal judge invalidated a lease sale of 80 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico that the Interior Department had made available for oil and gas drilling in November, saying regulators used flawed environmental analysis.
In a 68-page ruling on Thursday, Judge Rudolph Contreras of the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., called the federal agency's error in its environmental-impact determination ""a serious failing.""
Federal officials held the lease sale, which would have marked the largest offshore oil-and-gas lease sale in U.S. history, on Nov. 17 but hadn't allowed the leases to become effective yet, according to court papers. The leases could have taken effect as early as Feb. 1, court papers said.
Chevron Corp. identified itself in court papers as the highest bidder on several dozen tracts. A Chevron representative didn't respond to a request for comment.
The court ruling marks the latest development in the U.S.'s federal oil-and-gas leasing program, which has been targeted by climate groups and whose operations came under review at the start of the Biden administration. That review triggered several court challenges, including one that led Interior officials to conclude that they had to sell the oil and gas leases.
Erik Milito, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade association that represents offshore drilling and wind development, criticized the uncertainty surrounding the program.
""At a time of geopolitical uncertainty and rapidly rising energy prices, U.S. oil and gas production is more important than ever to curb inflation and to fortify our national security,"" he said in a statement.
Environmental groups sued over the lease sale in August, saying Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management failed to properly consider the environmental impacts of its decision to open up federal lands for oil and gas leases under the National Environmental Policy Act.
Specifically, the groups challenged the federal agency's calculation of greenhouse gas emissions in its environmental evaluation, despite other court decisions that laid out acceptable methodology.
""Barreling full-steam ahead with blinders on was simply not a reasonable action for BOEM to have taken here,"" Judge Contreras, who was appointed by President Obama, said in the ruling.
Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said the agency is reviewing the decision. She didn't say whether the agency would redo the environmental evaluation with the intent to hold another lease sale.
""We have documented serious deficiencies in the federal oil and gas program,"" Ms. Schwartz said. ""Especially in the face of the climate crisis, we need to take the time to make significant and long overdue programmatic reforms.""
Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the ruling a ""huge victory for our climate."" She said that new oil leases ""are fundamentally incompatible with addressing the climate emergency and they'll cause more oil spills and harm to wildlife and people in the Gulf.""
In June, another federal judge, in a separate lawsuit brought by Louisiana and several other states, ruled that the Interior Department should resume holding such lease sales even after President Biden ordered a pause on them shortly after taking office. Judge Terry A. Doughty of the U.S. District Court in Monroe, La., said the administration didn't have approval from Congress."

SYDNEY -- With global supply chains gumming up due to the pandemic, Chevron Corp. feared a lack of parts could cause a costly delay to planned maintenance at its $54 billion Gorgon gas-export project in Australia.
So executives hit upon a backup plan. Chevron asked a local firm called AdditiveNow to demonstrate whether the same parts could be made using 3-D printing technology.
The imported components did arrive at Gorgon in time, but Chevron was so impressed with the manufacturing specifications produced by AdditiveNow that it acquired the intellectual property for use on future projects, accelerating its 3-D printing research-and-development efforts by a year.
""We've learned a lot from those parts,"" said Chevron manager Robert Rettew, whose materials R&D portfolio includes 3-D printing. ""The most important thing is that we've shown that this flexible, right part, right time digital supply-chain approach can be successful, and it can meet our needs.""
The pandemic is giving 3-D printing a shot in the arm. Factors including extensive congestion at ports and other transportation nodes have slowed delivery of goods just as companies try to meet demand unleashed by economies reopening.
For commodities industries, one missing part can be costly if it forces operations offline. An estimate by Energy and Industrial Advisory Partners LLC puts the average cost of unplanned downtime for Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operators at about $20 million annually, rising to $50 million for larger operators."

Big oil companies are generating their strongest cash flows in years and heeding investor calls to return it to shareholders instead of using it to drill.
The two largest U.S. oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., reported on Friday their most profitable quarterly earnings since before the onset of the global pandemic.
Exxon reported earnings of $6.8 billion, its best quarterly performance since 2017, and said it would launch a $10 billion share buyback program starting next year. Chevron reported $6 billion in net income, its best quarter since 2013, and said it generated $6.7 billion in free cash flow, its most ever.
The industry is reaping the rewards of resurgent commodity prices -- U.S. crude has topped $80 a barrel this month for the first time since 2014 -- as the economy emerges from the stagnation brought on by Covid-19 and the shutdowns used to fight it. Global energy demand is rebounding faster than anticipated, and world-wide oil production, while still rising, is struggling to catch up with the surge in consumption.
Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if the oil industry will succumb to the temptation of plowing more money into growing production amid higher oil prices and increased demand, shrugging off austerity measures implemented during the pandemic.
After years of dismal returns, investors have sought pledges from producers that they will moderate growth and focus on shareholder payouts.
Some investors want companies to diversify and pivot to renewable energy as many countries transition to cleaner power sources because of concerns about climate change.
So far, most companies are sticking to smaller budgets and pledging to return more cash to shareholders.
Exxon raised its quarterly dividend on Wednesday by 1 cent, its first such increase since 2019, and said Friday it generated $12 billion in cash from operations.
Chevron said Friday that its year-to-date capital spending is down 22% and it paid dividends of $2.6 billion, reduced debt by $5.6 billion, and repurchased $625 million of shares during the quarter.
""Free cash flow more than covered the dividend and $4 billion of additional debt reduction,"" said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. ""With the progress made in restoring the strength of our balance sheet, this week we announced a dividend increase maintaining 39 consecutive years of annual dividend growth.""
Shares of Chevron rose 1.2% Friday, while Exxon shares were nearly flat at Friday's market close.
European energy companies are also raking in cash but say they will continue to use more of it to fund renewable-energy projects and investor payouts than growing oil and gas production.
TotalEnergies SE reported $4.6 billion in profit Thursday and said that strong cash generation from fossil fuels is enabling it to invest in growing its renewable-energy and electricity businesses. Royal Dutch Shell PLC, which is facing calls by activist investor Third Point LLC to split into two companies, reported a loss of $447 million Thursday, after writing off $5.2 billion linked to commodity derivatives. But the Anglo-Dutch giant said it produced $16 billion in free cash flow, its most ever, and would distribute $7 billion to shareholders from the $9.5 billion sale of its shale assets in the Permian Basin to ConocoPhillips in September. BP PLC reports earnings next week.
Though oil prices are up around 60% on the year, 50 of the largest oil companies have increased their annual budgets by only 1%, according to Raymond James. The companies initially budgeted $271 billion and that has only ticked up to $275 billion, the financial firm said in a note to investors.
Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of Adams Funds, said that in past oil-price surges Western oil companies have ramped up drilling, outspending their cash flows in pursuit of higher valuations to the detriment of returns. But even before the pandemic, investors began fleeing the sector and conveying to oil executives and boards that the only way to entice them back was to moderate growth and offer fat payouts, according to Mr. Stoeckle. The current price cycle is the first test of that capital discipline.
While most producers appear to be abiding by investors' wishes for now, questions linger for some about how they will spend their money beyond that. Unlike their European peers, U.S. oil companies are largely not diversifying into renewable energy.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has repeatedly said that Chevron won't invest in wind or solar power generation because he doesn't think it can make a larger return in those businesses. Instead, Chevron will return cash to investors and ""let them plant trees"" if they choose to, he said in a television interview in September.
Both Chevron and Exxon created low-carbon business units this year that will primarily focus onbiofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies. Chevron tripled its planned investment in its unit in September, saying it would spend $10 billion through 2028. Exxon increased its low-carbon spending Friday, saying it would invest $15 billion on such projects from 2022 through 2027.
But the increased green investment still represents a fraction of what the companies are spending on oil and gas projects, and it is unclear how profitable the units will be for the foreseeable future. Many of the technologies they are investing in will need further government subsidies to be economically viable.
Not everyone thinks tighter budgets are a good thing. During a contentious congressional hearing Thursday, some Republican lawmakers urged Messrs. Wirth and Woods and executives from Shell and BP to increase their oil production to alleviate high prices. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform convened the hearing after accusing the oil industry of waging a campaign to spread disinformation about fossil fuels' role in causing global warming.
Exxon has said it would keep production roughly flat. On Friday, it said quarterly production increased 4% from the same period last year.
Chevron is increasing production, modestly. Pierre Breber, its chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company's production was up 7% in the quarter compared with the same period last year and will increase 3% annually through 2025. But he said Chevron is unlikely to commission any mega-oil projects that take years to come online and years more to pay out. Instead it is planning to drill more shale wells in the U.S., which produce quickly but decline rapidly.
""This is a sector that is working hard to attract investors,"" Mr. Breber said. ""We really believe the winning combination for investors is the traditional business that's high return, low growth, low carbon combined with faster growing new energy businesses."""

But even before the pandemic, investors began fleeing the sector and conveying to oil executives and boards that the only way to entice them back was to moderate growth and offer fat payouts, according to Mr. Stoeckle. The current price cycle is the first test of that capital discipline, he said.
While most producers appear to be abiding by investors' wishes for now, questions linger for some about how they will spend their money beyond that. Unlike their European peers, U.S. oil companies are largely not diversifying into renewable energy.
Chevron CEO Mike Wirth has repeatedly said that Chevron won't invest in wind or solar power generation because he doesn't think it can make a larger return in those businesses. Instead, Chevron will return cash to investors and ""let them plant trees"" if they choose to, he said in a television interview in September.
Both Chevron and Exxon created low-carbon business units this year that will primarily focus on biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies. Chevron tripled its planned investment in its unit in September, saying it would spend $10 billion through 2028. Exxon increased its low-carbon spending Friday, saying it would invest $15 billion on such projects from 2022 through 2027.
But the increased green investment still represents a fraction of what the companies are spending on oil and gas projects, and it is unclear how profitable the units will be for the foreseeable future. Many of the technologies they are investing in will need further government subsidies to be economic.
Not everyone thinks tighter budgets are a good thing. During a contentious Congressional hearing Thursday, some Republican lawmakers urged Mssrs. Wirth and Woods and executives from Shell and BP to increase their oil production to alleviate high prices. Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform convened the hearing after accusing the oil industry of waging a campaign to spread disinformation about fossil fuels' role in causing global warming.
Exxon has said it would keep production roughly flat. On Friday, it said quarterly production increased 4% from the same period last year.
Chevron is increasing production, modestly. Pierre Breber, its chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company's production was up 7% in the quarter compared with the same period last year and will increase 3% annually through 2025. But he said Chevron is unlikely to commission any mega-oil projects that take years to come online and years more to pay out. Instead it is planning to drill more shale wells in the U.S., which produce quickly but decline rapidly.
""This is a sector that is working hard to attract investors,"" Mr. Breber said. ""We really believe the winning combination for investors is the traditional business that's high return, low growth, low carbon combined with faster growing new energy businesses.""

WASHINGTON -- Democratic lawmakers went on the offensive against the oil industry Thursday, challenging top executives from Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC on whether they genuinely supported efforts to address climate change.
Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform accused the oil industry of waging a yearslong campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming and lobbying against policies central to President Biden's $1.85 trillion social-policy and climate framework.
All four companies said that they have long acknowledged the threat of climate change and are cutting their carbon emissions to minimize their contributions to it.
""At Chevron, we have been very clear where we stand,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said. ""We accept the scientific consensus: Climate change is real, and the use of fossil fuels contributes to it.""
Democrats on the House committee said the companies publicly support climate-friendly policies and investments but privately work to derail regulations that would cut greenhouse gas emissions.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), chairman of the Subcommittee on the Environment, said that the American Petroleum Institute -- the industry's main lobbying group, which is funded by the companies -- is currently lobbying against Democrat-supported policies that he said would reduce emissions, including subsidies for electric vehicles and a methane tax.
""You're funding these groups, and they're really having an impact,"" Mr. Khanna told the executives. ""Could you tell them to knock it off for the sake of the planet?""
API president Mike Sommers responded to allegations the group was lobbying against Democrat-backed climate change policies by saying the group supports market adoption of electric vehicles and renewable energy, but not through government subsidies. He said renewable energy will be unable to replace fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.
""One area where experts agree is that oil and natural gas will continue to be the leading energy sources for decades to come, and it's important that we take action to reduce emissions while providing that energy,"" Mr. Sommers said.
The wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation detailed by Mr. Biden includes expanded tax credits for electric vehicles, but a methane tax was dropped after opposition from some lawmakers. The executives said they didn't always agree with every policy position taken by the industry's trade groups.
At the end of the roughly six-hour hearing, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D., N.Y.), the committee's chairwoman, said she would subpoena the companies to compel documents requested by Democrats that she said the companies hadn't provided.

WASHINGTON—Democratic lawmakers went on the offensive against the oil industry Thursday, challenging top executives from Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC on whether they genuinely supported efforts to address climate change.
Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform accused the oil industry of waging a yearslong campaign to spread disinformation about the role of fossil fuels in causing global warming and lobbying against policies central to President Biden's $1.85 trillion social-policy and climate framework .

The wide-ranging framework for social-spending legislation detailed by Mr. Biden includes expanded tax credits for electric vehicles, but a methane tax was dropped after opposition from some lawmakers. The executives said they didn't always agree with every policy position taken by the industry's trade groups.
At the end of the roughly six-hour hearing, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D., N.Y.), the committee's chairwoman, said she would subpoena the companies to compel documents requested by Democrats that she said the companies hadn't provided.
During the hearing, Democrat committee members cited decades-old findings by Exxon scientists and others, made public years ago, that fossil fuels are contributing to climate change and could lead to environmental disasters. Democrats pointed to past public statements by the companies the lawmakers said played down the risk of climate change and contradicted the companies' own findings.
The industry broadly has faced criticism for efforts in the 1990s and early 2000s to cast doubt on climate change as scientists began to document it and better understand its potential effects.
States and cities, including New York, have sued oil and gas producers in more than two dozen lawsuits over alleged misstatements about fossil fuels' contribution to climate change but without success so far . A state judge cleared Exxon in the New York case in 2019, finding the state's attorney general failed to establish the oil giant had deceived investors about its climate change accounting.
Democrats on the committee have asked the companies to turn over talking points and other internal documents on climate science and clean energy that executives, lobbyists and public relations staff provided to lawmakers and executive branch officials since late 2015 and said the companies aren't complying with the requests thus far.
The companies have said they are complying. Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods denied that the company had spread disinformation about climate change and said Exxon has responded to the issue as the scientific community's understanding of it has developed.
""The fact that ExxonMobil has supported certain climate policies, such as a revenue-neutral carbon tax and adherence to the Paris Agreement, while opposing others, is not tantamount to promoting climate disinformation,"" Mr. Woods said in his statement.
Republican committee members, at times, came to the companies' defense and used the hearing as an opportunity to criticize Biden administration policies they said are causing soaring energy prices. Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) said the companies should increase their production to alleviate energy shortages.
""I'll tell you what's frustrating is a member of Congress telling American oil-and-gas companies to reduce production at the same time the President of the United States is begging OPEC to increase production,"" he said. ""That may be the dumbest thing I've ever heard.""
Mr. Woods and the other oil company executives testified via remote video links. Shell U.S. President Gretchen Watkins and BP America Inc. Chairman David Lawler also spoke.
The inquiry comes as Congress furiously negotiates the framework unveiled by Mr. Biden Thursday morning, which sets aside $555 billion for climate-related provisions.
Eighty percent of U.S.'s electricity comes from fossil fuel combustion. That combustion, methane leaks and other energy sector operations make the industry the largest source of U.S. man-made greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. government's annual emissions inventory report .
Exxon and Chevron announce their quarterly earnings Friday. Analysts expect the companies to report billions in profits, marking their strongest performance since before the global pandemic. Energy prices are reaching their highest levels in several years as the global economy recovers from the spread of Covid-19.
House Republicans put on the stand Neal Crabtree, a welder who worked on the Keystone pipeline expansion project and said it has been hard to find another job as energy firms hesitate to move forward on similar projects. In January, Mr. Biden revoked a permit for the project, prompting the developer to abandon it.
In September, Democrats on the committee opened an investigation into oil companies' statements in support of addressing climate change after environmental group Greenpeace released footage of a senior Exxon lobbyist, Keith McCoy, saying the oil giant was working to strip out certain provisions aimed at reducing carbon emissions from the massive infrastructure package proposed by Mr. Biden.
Mr. Woods apologized for Mr. McCoy's remarks and said they didn't represent the company's views.
The hearing took place days before Mr. Biden and other world leaders begin meeting at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow to discuss how to steer the world's energy industry toward cleaner sources to meet commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

| Jump to first hitMichael Wirth Chevron Corporation has issued an updated climate change resilience report that further details the company’s ambition to advance our lower carbon future, adopting a 2050 net zero aspiration for equity upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions.The TCFD-aligned report describes how Chevron is incorporating Scope 3 emissions into its greenhouse gas emission targets by establishing a Portfolio Carbon Intensity (PCI) target inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 as well as Scope 3 emissions from the use of its products.“Solutions start with problem solving, which is exactly what the people of Chevron do – and have excelled at for over 140 years,” said Michael Wirth, Chevron’s chairman and CEO. “This report offers further insights about our strategy, how we are investing in lower-carbon businesses and why we believe this is an exciting time to be in the energy industry.”Chevron’s new PCI target assists with transparent carbon accounting and company comparison from publicly available data. The target covers the full value chain, including Scope 3 emissions from the use of products.The company has set a greater than 5 percent carbon emissions intensity reduction target from 2016 levels by 2028. This target is aligned with Chevron’s strategy which allows flexibility to grow its traditional business, provided it remains increasingly carbon-efficient, and pursue growth in lower-carbon businesses. Chevron plans to publish a PCI methodology document and online tool to enable third parties to calculate PCI for energy companies.Chevron’s 2050 equity upstream Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration builds on the company’s disciplined approach to target setting and action. The path to this net zero aspiration anticipates partnerships with multiple stakeholders and progress in technology, policy, regulations, and offset markets.“We regularly engage with stakeholders and investors to understand their views and to be responsive to their increasing expectations on all issues, including ESG,” said Dr Ronald Sugar, Chevron’s lead director. “Our updated report demonstrates our goal to partner with many stakeholders to work toward a lower carbon future.” – TradeArabia News Service"

| Jump to first hitChevron Corp. committed to an ""aspiration"" of net zero emissions from its operations by 2050 as the company responds to rising investor and societal pressure to play a bigger role in a transition to a low-carbon future.
Chevron also set a target of reducing carbon intensity by five per cent from 2016 levels by 2028 for the full lifecycle of its products, the San Ramon, Calif.-based company said Monday in a report.
The target includes Scope 3 emissions, or those of its customers, which make up the majority of fossil fuel pollution.
While the pledge falls short of those made by European peers such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc, it's the first time Chevron has outlined a multi-decade strategic commitment to reduce emissions. U.S. majors have been more reticent in adopting bold, long-term targets due to uncertainty over how to actually achieve them, an unwillingness to make large moves outside their core competency areas, and a desire to produce more oil and gas.
""In transition, companies that are delivering any unit of energy at a more efficient carbon intensity are beneficial to our overall progress,"" Bruce Niemeyer, Chevron's vice-president for sustainability and strategy, said in an interview. ""That's the most important thing.""
Whether it's enough to appease shareholders remains to be seen.
In May investors defied Chevron's board and voted to reduce Scope 3 emissions on an absolute basis, not just intensity, which is a measure tied to the amount of energy produced.
Follow This, the Dutch campaigner that filed the investor proposal, said Chevron's new goal is ""disappointing tokenism.""
Rather than a five-per-cent reduction in Scope 3 intensity, absolute emissions need to come down by 40 per cent by 2030 to have any chance of achieving the 2016 Paris Agreement, the group said in a statement.
Niemeyer said today's climate report ""reflects a lot of investor feedback.""
Chevron isn't the first U.S. oil company to adopt looser language around the definition ""net zero"" than when the term was first introduced a few years ago. ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum Corp. have also set 2050 net zero as an ambition or an aspiration rather than a hard target.
But semantics aside, even those oil companies with seemingly stringent targets are light on detail with how to eliminate carbon emissions from their fossil fuels, especially in the outer decades of their plans.
ExxonMobil Corp. executives expressed skepticism over net zero targets earlier this year in a meeting with Citigroup Inc. banker Stephen Trauber because they had no concrete plans of how to get there.
""I assured them most companies today who have committed to net zero don't have a plan on how to get there, but they're working to get there,"" Trauber said last month.
Exxon is routinely evaluating its climate pledges ""to reflect the changing landscape,"" it said in a statement at the time.

Chevron Corp. said it has an ""aspiration"" to reduce or offset carbon emissions from its operations to zero by 2050, as investor and public pressure mounts on oil producers to respond to climate change.
The company on Monday also for the first time set a target for reducing the intensity of the carbon emissions from the fuel and other products it makes, though it didn't set an outright reduction goal for those products.
A proposal that the company substantially reduce emissions from its products -- a stance that Chevron had urged investors to reject -- garnered 61% support at the company's annual shareholders meeting this year.
Other large oil companies have disclosed similar net-zero goals over the past two years, as they face calls from investors and activists to respond to ESG, or environmental, social and governance concerns.
""We regularly engage with stakeholders and investors to understand their views and to be responsive to their increasing expectations on all issues, including ESG,"" said Ronald Sugar, the lead director on Chevron's board. ""Our updated report demonstrates our goal to partner with many stakeholders to work toward a lower carbon future.""
Some analysts say the pressure to curb future emissions is now hindering the companies' ability to invest more heavily in fossil-fuel production.
U.S. oil prices topped $80 a barrel Monday as traders assess mounting energy supply shortages around the world. But large Western oil producers are sticking to austere budgets during the pandemic, when many drastically cut spending following a plunge in demand.
Chevron's net-zero announcement was immediately criticized by environmental groups, with shareholder activist group Follow This calling it ""disappointing tokenism."" Among other reasons, the groups said the goal was insufficient because it doesn't cover Chevron's products, only the emissions from its operations. ""Chevron is like a tobacco firm that promises to quit smoking, while continuing to produce cigarettes,"" said Follow This, which lodged the successful proposal at Chevron's annual meeting. ""Product emissions are up to 90% of all emissions of an oil major.""
BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC made commitments last year to zero out emissions produced by the assets they own, but U.S. oil companies have been slower to make such pledges.
Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Darren Woods in 2020 called the targets a ""beauty competition."" The oil giant is now considering making a net-zero pledge, The Wall Street Journal reported in August.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth previously said the company won't set targets for which it doesn't have a plan to achieve. Monday's announcement was short on details for how the company would achieve net-zero and stopped short of pledging to do so, as other companies have. Chevron said the aspiration anticipates progress in technology, policy, regulations, and offset markets.
""Solutions start with problem solving, which is exactly what the people of Chevron do -- and have excelled at for over 140 years,"" Mr. Wirth said.
Chevron committed Monday to cutting the intensity of emissions from its oil-and-gas production and products by more than 5% by 2028. Such a reduction generally means cutting emissions per amount of energy produced, but a company can still increase emissions overall if it is producing more oil and gas in total. For that reason, many environmentalists have criticized the measure.
Chevron said its new targets give it flexibility to grow its oil-and-gas production, provided it is increasingly carbon-efficient. The company also said it would pursue investments in lower-carbon businesses, which include biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture.

NEW YORK -- Disbarred attorney Steven Donziger was sentenced Friday to six months in prison for contempt of court after a federal judge concluded that he willfully violated orders stemming from a three-decade-long legal battle against Chevron Corp. over pollution in the Ecuadorean rainforest.
Friday's sentencing follows a July ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York finding Mr. Donziger guilty of six counts of criminal contempt of court. She found that he disobeyed court orders as he sought to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment that he won against the oil company in Ecuador and that he was barred from profiting from.
Before handing down the sentence of six months and a $10 fee, Judge Preska said Mr. Donziger's conduct had shown an astonishing disrespect for the law and the authority of federal courts.
""Mr. Donziger spent the last seven plus years thumbing his nose at the U.S. judicial system,"" she said. ""It's now time to pay the piper.""
Mr. Donziger, who has spent two years in home confinement, vowed to appeal. ""I cannot today express remorse for actions I maintain are ethical and legal,"" he told the judge.
He said the toll on his family and human-rights work had been punishment enough. Some of his supporters were at the courthouse Friday.
In her July ruling, Judge Preska concluded that ""at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.""
Mr. Donziger in 1993 first accused Texaco Inc. of polluting a swath of previously pristine rainforest, arguing in a New York lawsuit that the company's drilling activities ruined the quality of life for local indigenous communities. Chevron later acquired Texaco and assumed its legal defense.
The company pushed back, successfully moving the dispute to Ecuador, where a protracted trial ended in a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. The win, however, was fleeting, with Chevron accusing Mr. Donziger and his allies of manipulating the proceeding even before the final judgment was entered.
That dispute brought the battle back to the U.S., where Chevron won a civil racketeering lawsuit codifying its theory that the Ecuadorean judgment was the product of ghostwriting and other inappropriate acts.

NEW YORK—Disbarred attorney Steven Donziger was sentenced Friday to six months in prison for contempt of court after a federal judge concluded that he willfully violated orders stemming from a three-decade-long legal crusade against Chevron Corp. over pollution in the Ecuadorean rainforest.
Friday's sentencing follows a July ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York finding Mr. Donziger guilty of six counts of criminal contempt of court . She found that he disobeyed court orders as he sought to enforce a $9.5 billion judgment that he won against the oil giant in Ecuador and that he was barred from profiting from.
Before handing down the sentence of six months and a $10 fee, Judge Preska said Mr. Donziger's conduct had shown an astonishing disrespect for the law and the authority of federal courts.
""Mr. Donziger spent the last seven plus years thumbing his nose at the U.S. judicial system,"" she said. ""It's now time to pay the piper.""
Mr. Donziger, who has already spent two years in home confinement, vowed to appeal. ""I cannot today express remorse for actions I maintain are ethical and legal,"" he told the judge.
He said the toll on his family and human-rights work had been punishment enough. Some of his supporters were at the courthouse Friday, many wearing face masks with the words ""Free Donziger,"" and dozens of his backers had written to Judge Preska asking that he be sentenced to time already served.
Before Friday's hearing, the Harvard Law School grad had already been stripped of his ability to practice law and largely confined to his Manhattan apartment since August 2019, wearing an ankle bracelet.
In her July ruling, which came after a five-day trial , Judge Preska concluded that ""at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.""
Mr. Donziger in 1993 first accused Texaco Inc. of polluting a swath of previously pristine rainforest, arguing in a New York lawsuit that the company's drilling activities ruined the quality of life for local indigenous communities. Chevron later acquired Texaco and assumed its legal defense.
The company pushed back, successfully moving the dispute to Ecuador, where a protracted trial ended in a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in 2011. The win, however, was fleeting, with Chevron accusing Mr. Donziger and his allies of manipulating the proceeding even before the final judgment was entered.
That dispute brought the battle back to the U.S., where Chevron won a civil racketeering lawsuit codifying its theory that the Ecuadorean judgment was the product of ghostwriting and other inappropriate acts. That 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan essentially blocked Mr. Donziger from trying to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment or from ever profiting from the award.
Chevron has denied any culpability for lasting oil damage in the jungle, saying the company resolved the issue with Ecuador decades ago. It hasn't paid any of the $9.5 billion award.
Chevron repeatedly flagged to Judge Kaplan when its lawyers believed Mr. Donziger was disobeying his 2014 ruling, including once when he hired a life coach in exchange for a sliver of his share in the Ecuadorean judgment.
In 2019 Judge Kaplan brought criminal contempt charges and referred the matter to Judge Preska for trial. In an unusual move, the case is being prosecuted by a private lawyer because the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York declined to pursue it.
That private prosecutor, New York lawyer Rita Glavin, asked the judge in a court filing to consider that ""Mr. Donziger's disobedience was deliberate and repeated. He has expressed no remorse for his conduct. To this day, Mr. Donziger has not produced documents he was ordered to produce.""
Ms. Glavin also encouraged the court to ""consider a sentence to deter those who would seek to undermine the rule of law in this way in the future.""
An attorney for Mr. Donziger, Ronald Kuby, saw it differently.
""Mr. Donziger has been punished enough,"" he wrote in a presentencing memo.

Oil companies face a slippery path on their energy-transition journey. Pivot too quickly to clean energy and valuations fall in anticipation of poor future returns. Budge too little and your board risks getting a revamp by an activist investor (a la Exxon Mobil).
Major European oil companies such as BP, TotalEnergies and Royal Dutch Shell have all taken the fast-track path, pledging to plow more sizable portions of their budgets into renewable energy with so-so returns. Their valuations have slipped accordingly, but investors may have been too quick to judge.
The U.S. oil majors' shares trade at a roughly 58% premium to European peers as a multiple of forward-12-month earnings. The latter have historically lagged behind U.S. oil companies on valuation, but the gap has grown. Ten years ago, U.S. oil majors traded at a more moderate 24% premium to their European peers.
So what are Exxon Mobil and Chevron doing right? The U.S. majors announced more moderate investments in speculative new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture, actively avoiding wind and solar because of low expected returns. The sums they are pledging are paltry compared with European investors but enough to quell activist pressure -- at least for now. Chevron said earlier this month it plans to spend $10 billion between now and 2028 on new technologies, while Exxon Mobil set aside $3 billion for such endeavors through 2025.
The U.S. companies each pledged less than 5% of their 2021 capital expenditures on low carbon investments while Royal Dutch Shell, BP and TotalEnergies are all spending at least 10%, according to an analysis from Raymond James.
The choice comes down to risk. Investing in BP, Shell or TotalEnergies invites lower but more predictable returns as more capital gets allocated away from profitable drilling. Lightsource BP, BP's renewable-development arm, has said its renewable projects have consistently delivered 8% to 10% returns. Oil-and-gas companies target higher returns in the order of 10% to 15%.
Technologies that Exxon and Chevron are spending money on -- hydrogen, carbon capture and renewable fuels -- could pay off in a big way or become costly white elephants. In a research note, RBC analysts Biraj Borkhataria and Erwan Kerouredan wrote that hydrogen and carbon capture ""will require a greater level of government support and collaboration with other sectors including end users, making it difficult to assess in a systematic way.""
A number of assumptions need to play out in order for Exxon and Chevron's strategy to prevail. One is that one of the moonshot technologies in which they are investing in needs to ""pop."" There is a chance this could happen, but also a fairly good chance the companies will have to invest a whole lot more to see tangible results, if those materialize at all. Biotech companies are richly valued for precisely those promises of breakthrough products, but they spend a much larger chunk of revenue on research and development to maximize their chances. Gilead spent roughly 20% of its revenue on R&D last year. Exxon and Chevron will end up spending a grand total of 0.2% of revenue on new technologies this year.
A cynical take is expecting Exxon and Chevron to benefit from relatively lax scrutiny of their green credentials compared with European peers, allowing them to grab European majors' market share over time. That seems to be a risky bet given activist investors' victories this year.
With that in mind, the market may have been too quick to dismiss the European oil majors' plans. In a world that will surely shift more toward electrification, there is an early mover advantage on having one's foot in the door on wind and solar. Perhaps more important, however, European companies with renewable-energy units have the potential to spin them off in the future at more attractive multiples.
""What is clear in the market today is that investors are willing to ascribe much higher valuations for [low-carbon assets] than hydrocarbon investments,"" according to the RBC research note. ""If the valuation disconnects continue, clearly the majors may look to spin out low-carbon segments in order to crystallize some of the 'value' created.""
At the moment, the European majors also excel on one metric that all oil investors -- climate-conscious or not -- care about: potential to return cash. European majors have higher expected 2022 free cash flow as a percentage of their market capitalization compared with Exxon and Chevron, according to FactSet.
In a market that favors growth potential over other metrics, investors' preference for Exxon and Chevron is unsurprising. As rhetoric around climate change ramps up around the world, however, the winds blowing in their direction could just as easily shift the other way."

The San Ramon, Calif., oil giant is pledging to spend $10 billion through 2028 on biofuels, hydrogen production, carbon capture and other technologies, up from a prior commitment of around $3 billion.
Mr. Wirth said in an interview that the spending boost reflects optimism in Chevron's new energies unit, announced in July to oversee the company's low-carbon investments. Chevron now expects the unit to generate more than $1 billion in operating cash flow by 2030, he said.
""We've reached a point where we've got enough knowledge of the technologies,"" Mr. Wirth said.
The increased green investment still represents a fraction of what Chevron is spending on oil and gas projects. In December, Chevron said its capital spending would range from $14 billion to $16 billion a year through 2025. The planned low-carbon investment would amount to roughly 10% of that.
Mr. Wirth said Chevron's strategy would allow the company to reinvest in its legacy business, while exposing it to new opportunities, as the nascent transition to lower-carbon emitting energy sources unfolds. Chevron could invest more in low-carbon energy, if certain policy incentives were put in place, he said.
Mr. Wirth has said Chevron supports a price on carbon as the primary policy mechanism to spur the energy transition. Such a price could result from a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, but Chevron hasn't endorsed a specific regulatory regime. A carbon price could improve the economics of carbon capture, for example, allowing Chevron to capture emissions, store them, and sell carbon emission offset credits to other companies.
Mr. Wirth has branded the company's strategy as ""higher returns, lower carbon."" Chevron fleshed out its plans in a presentation to investors Tuesday morning.
""We're trying to create options as the energy system evolves,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""We would hope to spend more than this in the future, predicated on certain things that may come to pass.""
Investors are increasingly asking oil companies to diversify beyond fossil fuels and articulate a strategy for charting how they will navigate tightening global regulations on oil and gas.
The Wall Street Journal previously reported Chevron is preparing to defend itself against a potential challenge from activist investors like the one by hedge fund Engine No. 1 that roiled Exxon Mobil Corp. earlier this year.
Chevron's plans don't involve investing in solar or wind power generation, which Mr. Wirth said are mature businesses that offer little profit opportunity for Chevron. Mr. Wirth told analysts Tuesday that the company believes its new low-carbon investments can earn double-digit returns immediately, whereas investing in wind and solar power would yield less than a 10% return for Chevron.
Instead, the company plans to increase production of biofuels and hydrogen and has signed a handful of such deals with industrial companies and airlines in recent weeks. Chevron also said it would capture or offset 25 million metric tons of carbon emissions a year.
Chevron hasn't made a so-called net-zero commitment to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and Mr. Wirth previously said the company won't set targets which it doesn't have a plan to achieve. Instead, Chevron has made pledges to reduce its so-called carbon intensity -- or emissions as a proportion of total energy produced -- and says the company has met those targets.
Beginning last year, several large European oil companies, including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, committed to reduce to zero the net carbon emissions produced by the assets they own. Exxon Mobil is considering a similar pledge, The Wall Street Journal reported last month."

Chevron will publish an update on its emission-reduction efforts later this year. Mr. Wirth said the company would also update investors on its thinking about net zero.
""We're not opposed to it all,"" Mr. Wirth said of such goals. ""But for us to declare we believe we can get there, we need to have confidence we can.""

 Chevron to Triple Low-Carbon Investment"

| Jump to first hitChevron Corp. has inked eight deals in little more than two weeks to invest in hydrogen, green jet fuel and renewable natural gas ahead of a presentation to investors next week on ESG. Amid rising shareholder pressure on climate issues, Chevron is proactively forging climate-friendly joint ventures with an array of startups as well as corporate giants that include Caterpillar Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. The moves come just months after tiny activist fund Engine No. 1 put the oil industry on notice that the days of ignoring appeals from climate-conscious investors are over. In a stunning reversal, ExxonMobil Corp. was forced to surrender 25 per cent of its board seats to outsiders after Engine No. 1 persuaded the oil titan's largest shareholders to rebuff company leadership.
Chevron chief executive Mike Wirth is expected to flesh out his ""higher returns, lower carbon"" strategy on Sept. 14 at the oil explorer's first-ever ESG-focused investor day, titled ""Energy Transition Spotlight.""
The environmental, social and governance event was arranged and announced a full two months before Chevron's own dissenting shareholders approved an emissions-reduction proposal opposed by the board of directors in late May. ""Investors aren't yet buying what Chevron is selling on climate,"" said Andrew Logan, director at Ceres, a coalition of environmentally active investors managing US$37 trillion. ""Investor patience has really run out with this sector and investors aren't afraid to shake up boards if they don't see a response to their concerns."" Chevron's efforts this year have included new emissions targets and the creation of Chevron New Energies in July to invest in low-carbon technologies.
The most recent was Thursday's agreement with Mercuria Energy Trading to sell compressed natural gas as motor fuel. Wirth has no easy task ahead. Unlike its biggest European rivals, Chevron hasn't established any targets aimed at eliminating carbon emissions. The driller's environmental pillar score of 3.01 out of 10 is below those of Equinor ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, but surpasses Exxon, Saudi Aramco, and the statebacked oil majors in Russia and China, according to Bloomberg's ESG ratings. Chevron's emissions-reduction efforts focus on carbon intensity, or the pollution released for every unit of energy produced. The company has been successful in reducing this measure significantly over the past few years, but the metric is controversial because it allows wiggle room to continue increasing overall fossil-fuel production. Chevron has increased oil and natural gas output by almost 20 per cent since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2016.
""You should want the best producers to be meeting the most demand that they can, so it's not the dirtiest producer,"" Wirth told a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. conference in June. If the most-responsible drillers abandon oil production, ""you could see more emissions rather than less."" ""Intensity metrics were invented by the oil and gas industry to create an illusion of emission progress, while allowing for exponential growth,"" said Josh Eisenfeld of Earthworks, a non-profit that filed a greenwashing complaint against Chevron with the Federal Trade Commission in March. Chevron declined to comment for this story. ""It's certainly in Chevron's interests to do whatever it can to avoid making themselves into the next target"" of activists, Ceres's Logan said. ""Next week will go a long way into determining whether Chevron becomes the next focus or not."" Bloomberg"

[The trusted advisers of top business leaders]
Dambisa Moyo wrote the book ""How Boards Work"" to explain what corporate directors do. She turns to her own personal board for advice on how to do it better.
The 52-year-old Zambian-born economist currently serves as a director for three companies: manufacturer 3M Co., energy giant Chevron Corp. and publisher Conde Nast. That means handling acquisitions and questions of succession while also opining on public policy issues such as climate change and voting rights.
Ms. Moyo, who has a master's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oxford, left a Wall Street career in 2009 to become a full-time author, starting with ""Dead Aid"" in 2009. She also joined her first board that year. ""How Boards Work,"" published earlier this year, is her fifth book.
When seeking out advice she looks for a diversity of opinions and the type of constructive feedback that can be difficult to find.
""I'm a Black woman -- and I think that I talk a lot about this in my own writings -- but we're not entitled to feedback,"" she said. ""Whoever you are, you have to work to foster an environment for people to give you critical feedback.""
Here are four of her most trusted advisers.
Mellody Hobson
Co-CEO of Ariel Investments, chairwoman at Starbucks Corp.
Ms. Moyo and Ms. Hobson grew up in different places -- Ms. Hobson is from Chicago -- but share similar experiences. Both attended Ivy League colleges and serve on corporate boards -- a rare set of experiences for Black women, Ms. Moyo said. Ms. Moyo said Ms. Hobson taught her to be more ideological and understand that ""what is right is obvious."" In 2018 Ms. Hobson was vocal in disagreeing with a now-ended U.S. policy of separating immigrant children and parents at the border. ""There's value in speaking out on some of these issues,"" Ms. Moyo said.
Dan Loeb
CEO of Third Point LLC
Ms. Moyo said Mr. Loeb, a hedge-fund manager, is like a brother to her. They have known each other for two decades. One valuable lesson from Mr. Loeb is that Ms. Moyo should focus on process rather than outcomes, she said, which is advice she applies to her oversight of company operations. For instance, she said, if a company has the right processes for hiring, promoting, compensating and operating, then it will function at the highest level. ""If you're focused on the outcomes,"" she said, ""the problem is that you can end up with really bad culture.""
Diane von Furstenberg
Director of The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation
Ms. Moyo said she hopes to emulate the life of Ms. von Furstenberg, a fashion icon. ""She's just in many ways everything I want to be,"" Ms. Moyo said. ""She's an immigrant, she came to this country, she built this business. She's in her 70s and she's still writing books . . . she's eternally evolving."" One critical piece of advice from Ms. von Furstenberg is that trial and error is OK. ""She shifted my attitude towards things,"" Ms. Moyo said. That mind-set shift led Ms. Moyo to try trampolining as a form of exercise during the pandemic.
Andrew Wylie
Founder of the Wylie Agency and literary agent
Ms. Moyo said Mr. Wylie, her book agent, does not mince words. The two have worked on four books after meeting roughly 12 years ago, and Ms. Moyo said Mr. Wylie taught her not to take short cuts. He will often tell her something doesn't work and encourage her to fix pages or take a different approach to the structure. One time a book reviewer found a typo after publication, and ""he actually made me think that that was not acceptable,"" she said. ""He could have comforted me, but he didn't. He had enough faith in me that he wanted me to step up."""

The Zambian-born economist currently serves as a director for three companies: manufacturer 3M Co., energy giant Chevron Corp. and publisher Condé Nast. That assignment, she said, is different than it was just a decade ago. Board members not only have to handle activist fights, acquisitions and questions of succession. Now, she said, they are also expected to opine on public policy issues such as climate change, remote work and voting rights.

When Ms. Moyo has to grapple with these issues, she leans on a group of advisers that includes a fashion icon, a hedge-fund billionaire, an investment executive and a literary agent. She tries to cultivate a diversity of opinions and foster constructive feedback, which she said can be difficult to find otherwise. ""I'm a Black woman—and I think that I talk a lot about this in my own writings —but we're not entitled to feedback,"" she said. ""Whoever you are, you have to work to foster an environment for people to give you critical feedback.""
Ms. Moyo, who has a master's degree from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oxford, was previously an executive for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. She left Wall Street to become a full-time author and joined her first board—brewer SABMiller—that year. Her 2009 book ""Dead Aid"" attracted attention by arguing that foreign aid made the economic and political situation in Africa worse instead of relieving it. ""How Boards Work,"" her fifth and latest book, offers her view of how boards should operate in a turbulent world.
""There has been a very strong anticapitalist movement, a very strong anti-corporate movement,"" she said. ""I was already thinking about how do we really explain why corporations are important, not just for creating jobs, not just the tax base, but also for innovation and investing in structural things like infrastructure.""
Here are four of her most trusted advisers:
Mellody Hobson
Co-CEO of Ariel Investments, director at Starbucks Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Ms. Moyo considers Ms. Hobson the chairwoman of her personal board. The two met at a conference more than 10 years ago and were introduced by Ms. Hobson's now husband George Lucas. Now Ms. Hobson is an adviser, friend and confidante professionally and socially, ranging from philanthropic matters to health and wellness.
While the two women grew up in different places—Ms. Hobson is from Chicago—they share similar experiences. Both attended Ivy League colleges and serve on corporate boards—a rare set of experiences for Black women, Ms. Moyo said.
Ms. Moyo said Ms. Hobson taught her to be more ideological and understand that ""what is right is obvious."" For instance, Ms. Hobson was vocal in disagreeing with a U.S. policy of separating immigrant children and parents on the border that was implemented—and then ended—by the Trump administration in 2018.
""There's value in speaking out on some of these issues,"" Ms. Moyo said. ""In our position of privilege, if we're not going to do it then who will?""
Dan Loeb
CEO of Third Point LLC
Ms. Moyo and Mr. Loeb, a hedge-fund manager, have known each other for roughly two decades. She said he is like a brother to her; they can speak without a filter.
Part of their close bond is a shared passion for fitness, such as their affinity for ultra-endurance athlete David Goggins. They both have pricked their fingers so they could calculate their breakdown of fat.
Mr. Loeb also has taught Ms. Moyo to focus on process rather than outcomes, she said. Ms. Moyo said she uses that lesson across her life, from company operations and even with fitness. For instance, she said, if a company has the right processes for hiring, promoting, compensating and operating, then it will function at the highest level.
""If you're focused on the outcomes,"" she said, ""the problem is that you can end up with really bad culture.""
Diane von Furstenberg
Fashion designer and director of the The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation
Ms. Moyo said she hopes to emulate the life of Ms. von Furstenberg, whom Ms. Hobson introduced her to roughly five years ago.
""She's just in many ways everything I want to be,"" Ms. Moyo said. ""She's an immigrant, she came to this country, she built this business. She's in her 70s and she's still writing books. She just opened Little Island [in New York City]. She's eternally evolving.""
A key moment in their friendship happened when the two women were wrapping up lunch at Ms. von Furstenberg's office about two years ago. As Ms. Moyo walked down the stairs she saw Ms. von Furstenberg's famed wrap dresses but then spotted the fashion designer's art gallery full of pieces by women.
""It was just another sort of piece of how she thinks about supporting women, supporting businesses,"" Ms. Moyo said. The two had been talking about the intersection of philanthropy and business, and Ms. Moyo was struck by Ms. von Furstenberg's advice that anything is possible—and that trial and error is OK.
""She shifted my attitude towards things,"" Ms. Moyo said. Because of that mind-set shift, Ms. Moyo said she decided to try trampolining as a form of exercise during the pandemic.
Andrew Wylie
Founder of the Wylie Agency and literary agent
When Ms. Moyo met Mr. Wylie around 12 years ago through the historian Niall Ferguson, she realized early on that he is a truth teller.
""He does not mince words,"" she said. He soon became her book agent, and the two have worked on her latest four books together.
Ms. Moyo said Mr. Wylie taught her not to take short cuts. For instance, he'll often push back and tell her something doesn't work and will encourage her to fix pages or take a different approach to the structure.
Ms. Moyo specifically remembers when a book reviewer found a typo after publication. ""He actually made me think that that was not acceptable,"" she said. ""He could've comforted me, but he didn't. He had enough faith in me that he wanted me to step up.""

Royal Dutch Shell PLC is considering requiring that workers in select locations, including the Gulf of Mexico, receive Covid-19 vaccines, according to a company document.
The oil major considered the pros and cons of mandating vaccinations in the document, which was shared with Shell's executive committee earlier this month, though no decision has been taken, a person familiar with the matter said. The company's current policy is to strongly encourage vaccination but not require it, according to the document, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
The document was reported earlier by the Financial Times.
Other oil companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Valero Energy Corp., already require some employees to be vaccinated.
For instance, Chevron is requiring that offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico to be vaccinated by Nov. 1, and that expatriate employees, workers traveling internationally and employees aboard U.S.-flagged ships get vaccinated. The company is considering applying the mandate more broadly.
Many oil companies have struggled with coronavirus outbreaks, including at work camps and offshore platforms where employees live and work in close quarters.
Outbreaks of the virus have recently affected operations in key production areas including the Gulf of Mexico, the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico.
The debate over whether to implement vaccine mandates has challenged U.S. companies, with executives wanting to ensure staff and customers are safe, while not wanting to risk losing some workers in a tight labor market. In Europe, concerns including human rights and privacy have tempered those discussions.

Chevron Corp. is preparing to defend itself against a potential challenge from activist investors like the one that roiled Exxon Mobil Corp. earlier this year, according to people familiar with the matter.
In recent weeks, Chevron executives met with representatives of Engine No. 1, the investment firm that led the successful fight to win three seats on Exxon's board, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron shared some of its plans to reduce carbon emissions during the talks, which were described as cordial, and Engine No. 1 gave no indication that it would pursue a campaign against Chevron, the people said.
Engine No. 1 is considering whether to target a major oil company once again, and other investors have been in touch with the hedge fund about organizing a group to purchase Chevron shares, sounding out if there is interest in launching a second major campaign, people familiar with the matter said. Engine No. 1 hasn't made any decision about another campaign, one of the people said.
Chevron has studied Engine No. 1's campaign against Exxon, and its rival's defeat crystallized the urgency in communicating its energy-transition plans, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron's board met in person for the first time this summer since the onset of the pandemic. Topics of discussion included the Exxon-Engine No. 1 proxy fight, according to people familiar with the meeting.
Chevron has been developing its energy-transition strategy since the pandemic began. In coming weeks, it plans to announce more-ambitious carbon-reduction targets than those it has previously laid out, people familiar with the matter said. The company is also evaluating the addition of a new director with environmental expertise to its board, the people said.
""We have contingency plans to respond to many different types of events, including an activist investor,"" said Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall. ""We engage regularly with shareholders in constructive two-way dialogue and look forward to discussing the next chapter of our lower carbon story with them later this month.""
Engine No. 1's success has rippled across the energy sector, spurring Exxon's competitors to take a closer look at the environmental impact of their strategy, leadership and board makeup.
Actions of the Biden administration are adding to the pressure companies face regarding climate change. Public companies might soon be required to disclose in regulatory filings more information about climate-related risks -- including the emissions from the products they produce -- under a proposal being formulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Chevron Corp. is preparing to defend itself against a potential challenge from activist investors like the one that roiled Exxon Mobil Corp. earlier this year, according to people familiar with the matter.
In recent weeks, Chevron executives met with representatives of Engine No. 1, the investment firm that led the successful fight to win three seats on Exxon's board, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron shared some of its plans to reduce carbon emissions during the talks, which were described as cordial, and Engine No. 1 gave no indication that it would pursue a campaign against Chevron, the people said.
Engine No. 1 is considering whether to target a major oil company once again, and other investors have been in touch with the hedge fund about organizing a group to purchase Chevron shares, sounding out if there is interest in launching a second major campaign, people familiar with the matter said. Engine No. 1 hasn't made any decision about another campaign, one of the people said.

If activist investors challenge Chevron, do you think they will be successful in shaping the company's future? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Chevron has studied Engine No. 1's campaign against Exxon, and its rival's defeat crystallized the urgency in communicating its energy-transition plans, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron's board met in person for the first time this summer since the onset of the pandemic. Topics of discussion included the Exxon-Engine No. 1 proxy fight , according to people familiar with the meeting.
Chevron has been developing its energy-transition strategy since the pandemic began. In coming weeks, it plans to announce more-ambitious carbon-reduction targets than those it has previously laid out, people familiar with the matter said. The company is also evaluating the addition of a new director with environmental expertise to its board, the people said.
""We have contingency plans to respond to many different types of events, including an activist investor,"" said Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall. ""We engage regularly with shareholders in constructive two-way dialogue and look forward to discussing the next chapter of our lower carbon story with them later this month.""
Engine No. 1's success has rippled across the energy sector, spurring Exxon's competitors to take a closer look at the environmental impact of their strategy, leadership and board makeup.
Actions of the Biden administration are adding to the pressure companies face regarding climate change. Public companies might soon be required to disclose in regulatory filings more information about climate-related risks —including the emissions from the products they produce—under a proposal being formulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""The industry is under heat,"" said Les Csorba, who advises companies on corporate governance at the executive-search and leadership-advisory firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc. ""Every public company should be prepared."" Mr. Csorba was speaking generally and not about Chevron.

The firms are also Chevron's three largest shareholders.
Chevron could be a tougher target than Exxon in some respects. Chevron has been more frugal with its capital in recent years and has about $35 billion in debt, versus Exxon's roughly $57 billion. Engine No. 1 frequently compared Exxon and Chevron during the proxy campaign, noting the latter's superior returns.
Still, some investors want Chevron to do more. Nearly 61% of Chevron's shareholders voted in support of a proposal that it cut emissions created from use of its products, which Chevron had urged investors to reject. The proposal doesn't require Chevron to set a specific, binding target for such a reduction. Like Exxon, Chevron has eschewed investments in renewable energy, focusing instead on biofuels, hydrogen and lowering the carbon footprint of fossil fuels.
Emissions from gasoline and other products produced by oil companies and eventually burned by consumers represent the overwhelming majority of greenhouse gases tied to the oil industry. Some oil companies have resisted taking responsibility for those end-use emissions, known in climate-policy discussion as Scope 3 emissions, arguing that they have little control over how their products are used.

Chevron Corp. has begun requiring some employees to receive Covid-19 vaccinations and is evaluating mandates throughout its entire workforce as the oil-and-gas industry contends with rising infections, according to people familiar with the matter.
The second-largest U.S. oil company is one of the first major oil-and-gas producers to implement such requirements as the industry wrestles with unvaccinated field workers. Virus outbreaks have recently been affecting operations in key sites such as the offshore platforms of the Gulf of Mexico and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, several industry executives said.
Chevron is now requiring expatriate employees, workers traveling internationally, and employees on U.S.-flagged ships to receive vaccinations, said company spokesman Braden Reddall. It will also require offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico and some onshore support staff to be vaccinated by Nov. 1, he said. The requirements cover thousands of employees.
""Chevron is committed to protecting the health of our people, and vaccinations are the strongest safeguard against this virus,"" Mr. Reddall said.
Executives at the company are also evaluating the feasibility of mandates for each Chevron business unit and could implement such requirements more broadly through its roughly 47,000-member workforce, people familiar with the matter said.
The analysis includes the risk of infection within the unit and the availability of vaccines within the dozens of countries in which Chevron operates, the people said, adding that there is currently no plan for a companywide mandate. Chevron plans to allow exceptions to some employees for health or religious reasons, Mr. Reddall said.
Other oil-and-gas companies are considering similar vaccination policies, say people familiar with the matter. Oil producer Hess Corp. is requiring some employees to be vaccinated and refiner Valero Energy Corp. has implemented a requirement for new hires, say people familiar with the plans.
Hess has told its offshore workers in the Gulf of Mexico they must be vaccinated by Nov. 1 after an outbreak on one of its platforms there in recent weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
""Given the highly infectious nature of the Delta variant and the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the U.S., we are implementing additional preventative measures in our Gulf of Mexico operations to help ensure safety and business continuity,"" said Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker.
Not everyone in the industry supports company vaccination mandates. Phillips 66, one of the largest U.S. refiners, won't require its employees to receive vaccinations, according to Chief Executive Greg Garland.
""We strongly encourage people to be vaccinated,"" Mr. Garland said. ""But we haven't yet crossed a bridge where we're going to say everyone needs to be vaccinated.""
He said the company has offered vaccinations on-site at some refineries and believes more than 80% of the employees at its Houston headquarters are vaccinated.
Industry executives say they face a divide within their workforce over vaccines. Among primarily white-collar office employees, vaccination rates are high, the executives say. Field employees who work the industry's refineries, chemical plants, offshore platforms and other critical operations have much lower vaccination rates, internal company surveys show.
A significant number of workers have been infected in the Permian Basin, the most productive U.S. oil field, putting stress on an already thin workforce there, according to the executives. The same is true among workers in Louisiana, sparking concerns over outbreaks on remote offshore platforms where employees live for weeks at a time during shifts, some of the executives said."

Semiconductors might be the new oil—and that could make the 2020s the new 1970s.
Back then, the world ran on oil—and any change in supply had a massive impact on demand. When OPEC embargoed the U.S. in the 1970s, the price of crude rose from about $3 a barrel at the beginning of the decade to $13 a barrel by its end. The U.S. even issued gas ration coupons in 1974 .
The spike was good news for Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which returned roughly 100% and 70%, respectively, in the 1970s, but painful for everyone else, as inflation raged. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose just 17% and 5%, respectively, over the decade.
If oil was the necessary component for the 1970s economy, chips provide the same function in the 2020s. They power everything from our computers and phones to our cars and appliances. And, as everyone knows by now, there is a shortage, with delivery times growing to more than 20 weeks, per Susquehanna Financial Group data.
Roughly 80% of all the chips in the world are made in Northeast Asia. Politicians realize how big a problem this is, and they have started to demand local manufacturing, with President Joe Biden introducing a plan for $50 billion in chip research earlier this year. Reshoring any industry, including semiconductors, is a yearslong process that requires billions in capital. There will be winners and losers. And if it goes on too long, it will filter into the prices of all kinds of goods.
""Shortages related to rapid upswings in demand could become inflationary,"" TS Lombard's Rory Green and Steven Blitz wrote back in January, when the scarcity of chips—""a product more known for steadily declining prices""—was in its infancy.
The global semiconductor shortage has been a particular thorn in the side of the automotive industry all year. It was supposed to resolve itself by the second half of 2021. But more production cuts announced by Toyota Motor (TM) this past week shows the problem isn't going away soon. In fact, RBC analyst Joseph Spak argues the shortage could last for years.
Part of the problem is structural, Spak says. Electric vehicles need more computing power, but the auto industry typically relies on older-generation chip technology, where capacity isn't being as readily added by chip makers. Instead, they prefer to focus on newer, higher-end chips for the consumer electronics industry.
The result: Instead of lines at the gas stations, there are lines at the automotive dealerships. Low new- and used-car inventories have pushed up pricing and contributed to rising inflation. Used-car prices rose about 20% in the first half of 2021, while new-car prices rose about 3%. The rise in used-car prices has started to slow, but new-car price gains are accelerating, rising about 7% year over year in July.
That's not good for consumers, but auto makers stand to benefit. Constrained production will lead to persistently low inventories and higher pricing. Companies will sell fewer cars, but that's been offset by higher prices. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) shares are up 43% and 17%, respectively, in 2021, and both still trade for about seven times 2022 earnings.
And that's just the auto industry. The longer the chip shortage goes on, the more prices will rise in all types of products. That will benefit chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Wall Street sees upside in the latter. Some two-thirds of analysts covering the stock rate it Buy, and the average price target implies about a 33% upside.
Don't expect long lines outside RadioShack, but expect the chip shortage to be felt just the same.

Mr. Garland said the company has offered vaccinations on-site at some of its refineries and believes more than 80% of the employees at its Houston headquarters are vaccinated. The company recently reinstituted masking and social-distancing policies it previously had in place but dropped earlier this year.
Industry executives say they face a divide within their workforce over vaccines. Among primarily white-collar office employees, vaccination rates are high, the executives say. But field employees who work the industry's refineries, chemical plants, offshore platforms and other critical operations have much lower vaccination rates, internal company surveys show.
Similar workforce divides over vaccinations are bedeviling the broader corporate world. They are especially stark in industries, such as energy, where some workers can work from home and others can't and where views on vaccines differ widely . The energy industry produces fuels and chemicals essential to the global economy that require round-the-clock operations staffed by employees working in proximity to one another.
A significant number of workers have been infected in the Permian Basin, the most productive U.S. oil field, putting stress on an already thin workforce there, according to the executives. The same is true among workers in Louisiana, sparking concerns over outbreaks on remote offshore platforms where employees live for weeks at a time during shifts, some of the executives said.
The industry's largest employers, oil-field service companies—which operate drilling rigs, fracking units and other equipment—have experienced a rash of Covid-19 cases among vaccine-hesitant workers in recent weeks, say analysts and industry executives.
""You are dealing with a population that largely does not believe in vaccination,"" said Ann Fox, the chief executive of Nine Energy Service Inc., a company that helps complete oil wells and provides other services. ""I have employees fighting for their lives right now.""
Ms. Fox said the Delta variant has strained the service workforce, which was already thin after many workers left the industry last year following the collapse of commodity prices. She would like to implement a vaccine requirement for employees, but believes she would be unable to attract enough workers.
Ms. Fox fears that the thin workforce could affect U.S. oil production next year if current conditions continue. Many oil producers will have to drill new wells to maintain production levels, and could find it difficult to find roughnecks to staff drilling rigs, she said.
She said she hopes that oil-and-gas producers, her customers, will require vaccinations that could help establish an industrywide standard that vaccines are required for employment.
""It's a very fine line to walk as a business leader,"" Ms. Fox said. ""Nobody wants to be the first mover.""

| Jump to first hitNorway's wealth fund says there are oil companies in its portfolio that ""absolutely"" aren't doing enough to cut emissions, as the guidelines it operates by are reviewed to give climate risk greater prominence.
Norges Bank Investment Management still holds stakes in a number of fossil-fuel giants, including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and BP PLC, after failing to win political approval to dump its entire portfolio of oil stocks a few years back.
""These are companies we monitor very, very closely with a view to the climate and emissions,"" Carine Smith Ihenacho, chief corporate governance officer at the Oslo-based fund, said in an interview.
Norway is now taking another look at the mandate handed to its US$1.4-trillion wealth fund, the world's biggest. On Friday, a government-appointed expert group submitted its recommendations, amid increasingly disturbing evidence the planet is heating up much faster than previously feared.
The expert group says the government should ""change the mandate"" under which the fund operates to ""better handle climate risk."" Changes would include giving the fund more leeway to put pressure on greenhouse-gas emitters, using its global dominance as a stock owner to influence the outcome of shareholder votes. And if companies don't improve, the fund should have more scope to divest.
Martin Skancke, who led the expert group, said the fund already incorporates climate risks in its strategy. ""But that's because there have been people at the fund who are passionate about this, and who treat this as a serious issue,"" he said in an interview. But it's ""not satisfactory"" to just rely on good people, he said. ""It needs to be in the mandate.""
This year, Norway's wealth fund started voting against corporate boards, and Ihenacho says it's a tool that will increasingly be used to bring about change. That's as investor revolts become a more frequent occurrence, resulting in some spectacular upsets at a number of the world's biggest oil companies. Most notable among these was Exxon's failure in May to repel an uprising that handed board seats to an activist investor group insisting the company do more to reduce its carbon footprint.
Norway's wealth fund used the votes it had, which didn't include weighing in on shareholder proposals on board seats, to demand that Exxon be transparent around political contributions, in an effort to stop the kind of corporate lobbying that leads to dubious climate policies. The fund also withheld support for Exxon chief executive Darren Woods to continue as chairman, based on its view that those jobs shouldn't be held by one person.
""We use the tools we have,"" Ihenacho said.
She also points to Chevron Corp. as an example of shareholders forcing through change. Norway's wealth fund was among investors backing a successful proposal insisting that Chevron's emissions targets include Scope 3, which is the broadest definition and includes the carbon footprint of the oil giant's customers. The vote, which came the same day as the Exxon shareholder victory and coincided with a court decision in the Netherlands forcing Royal Dutch Shell PLC to slash emissions, sent shock waves through an oil industry used to pushing through its own agenda.
Norway, which is western Europe's biggest oil producer, has faced criticism for not using its giant investment vehicle to fight climate change more aggressively. This month, as the world braced for the latest assessment of the United Nations'Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of academics and economists lambasted nations that haven't set net-zero emissions goals for their wealth funds. Signatories include former executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres. At the front of the firing line was Norway.
Havard Halland, a former senior economist at the World Bank who started the pressure campaign on sovereign investors, says ""it has come to a point where choosing not to have climate goals is the active choice.""
He points out that Norway's wealth fund, through its portfolio holdings, emits twice as much carbon dioxide as the entire country, which isn't included in official Norwegian emissions statistics.
As Norway ""opts out"" of setting climate targets for its wealth fund, the country is essentially ""free riding"" on others'efforts to fight global warming, he said.
Norway's Finance Ministry will now go through the recommendations of the expert group, after which any decision needs to make its way through parliament."

British oil giant BP recently disclosed big changes in its U.S.-listed stock portfolio.
BP cut investments in Apple (ticker: AAPL), Chevron (CVX), and Microsoft (MSFT), and more than doubled its stake in Exxon Mobil (XOM) stock. The firm disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
BP didn't respond to a request for comment.
The company sold 164,754 Apple shares to end the second quarter with 376,971 shares of the iPhone maker.
Apple stock hasn't kept up with the market in 2021. Shares rose 3.2% in the first half, and so far in the third quarter they have gained 8.9%. For comparison, the S&P 500 index rose 14.4% in the first half, and so far in the third quarter it has risen 4.0%.
Apple investors have taken profits in the wake of strong earnings reports . The company has been building out its ad business . One observer thinks Apple's ad business could rise to about $3 billion in ad revenue in the fiscal year ending September, up from about $300 million in fiscal 2017.
BP slashed four-fifths of its investment in Chevron stock by selling 160,052 shares and ending June with 43,117 shares of the U.S. energy giant. Chevron stock soared 24% in the first half, and so far in the third quarter it has slipped 2.7%.
Chevron CEO Michael Wirth told us that most meetings ""now begin with a discussion of [environmental, social and governance factors], and that wasn't the case just a few years ago."" But the company's challenge is ""to deliver higher returns and lower carbon."" In July, Chevron announced a new stock-repurchase program . We recently highlighted big dividends in the sector, noting Chevron's yield of more than 5% .
Microsoft stock soared 21.8% in the first half, and so far in the third quarter it is up 8.1%.
Microsoft stock has been trading at record highs . The software giant's fiscal fourth quarter, ended June 30, was strong . We've named CEO Satya Nadella to our list of top CEOs , noting that he is ""one of the greatest value-generating corporate leaders of all time.""
BP sold 186,205 Microsoft shares to end the quarter with 524,975 shares.
The energy giant bought 178,852 additional Exxon shares to end June with 315,118 shares. Exxon stock rocketed 53% in the first half, and so far in the third quarter it has slipped 10%.
Exxon has seen earnings improve , but there have been major changes in its board: An upstart hedge fund won three seats in the latest election. Exxon is now considering pledging ""net zero"" carbon by 2050.

Big oil companies are raking in their highest profits since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, but they plan to continue spending sparingly to boost production despite higher commodity prices.
Exxon Mobil Corp. reported $4.7 billion in second-quarter profit Friday, while rival Chevron Corp. reported $3.1 billion in quarterly profit.
The results represented a dramatic turnaround from a year earlier, when Exxon reported a quarterly loss of $1.1 billion and Chevron lost $8.3 billion as demand for oil and gas plummeted due to the closing of economies world-wide due to the virus.
Some of the largest European oil companies also showed strong results earlier in the week. Royal Dutch Shell PLC reported $5.5 billion in net income, while TotalEnergies SE posted $3.5 billion in profits.
The oil and gas industry has recovered from unprecedented losses in 2020 as economies have reopened this year, sending prices to their highest levels in two years. U.S. oil prices have mostly stayed above $60 per barrel since March, after briefly turning negative in April and remaining below $50 for most of 2020. West Texas Intermediate closed at $73.81 on Friday, up 19 cents or 0.3%.
Still, none of the major Western producers said they would increase capital spending, as the companies face pressure from investors to moderate growth and clean up their emissions amid concerns about increasing regulations and climate change. Some European companies have promised to let production decline as they invest more in renewable energy.
Exxon cut its annual capital budget last year to $19 billion or less from $25 billion. It said Friday its capital expenditures this year will be closer to $16 billion and that its oil and gas production was down 2% from the same period last year.
""We think we have a good plan on our investments, we're making good progress on debt,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a call with analysts. ""We are focused on bringing in more profitable, higher-value barrels.""
Chevron said Friday that it, too, wouldn't raise capital spending. It had $5.3 billion of capital expenditures in the first six months of 2021, compared with $7.7 billion in the first six months of last year. Chevron previously said it would increase annual production at about 3% or less through 2025 and give priority to returning money to shareholders.
Both companies benefited from strong profits in their chemical businesses as demand for plastics and other products surged this year.
The restrained spending is an overture to investors who fled the sector after a decade of poor returns and longer-term concerns about the future for fossil fuels.
""Wall Street is not looking for accelerated reinvestment into the oil and gas business,"" said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners. ""This is a combo of ESG and energy transition concerns and scar tissue from the past decade.""
Shares in many oil and gas companies have sharply rebounded this year but remain below pre-Covid-19 prices. Chevron's stock is up more than 20% this year, but down about 4% from February of last year, while Exxon is up nearly 40%, but is down about 5% from pre-pandemic prices.
Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said many investors still question oil producers' commitment to capital discipline, especially with rising commodity prices. ""Demand for our products has fully recovered, except for jet [fuel],"" Mr. Breber said. ""Demand for our stock is more slowly recovering.""
To lure them back, Chevron has given priority to shareholder payouts. On Friday, it said it would resume share buybacks, which it paused in March 2020, at a rate of $2 billion to $3 billion a year. Chevron increased its dividend by 4% in April. Shell and Total reinstated buybacks this week.
Chevron on Thursday also announced a new business unit dedicated to technologies to lower carbon emissions. The move followed an announcement in February by Exxon that it would invest $3 billion through 2025 in a new, low-carbon business division.
Increasing investor payouts could be more difficult for Exxon, whose balance sheet holds more debt than Chevron's. The Irving, Texas-based company has nearly $60 billion in debt, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, compared with Chevron's roughly $38 billion in debt. Exxon held its dividend flat earlier this year.
Exxon will need to increase capital spending in its core assets, particularly in Guyana and the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, to generate the cash it needs to pay down debt and reward investors, said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
Exxon, the largest Western oil company, lost three seats on its board of directors at its annual meeting in May to hedge fund Engine No. 1, which had argued Exxon spent recklessly on unprofitable projects and had no strategy to navigate the energy transition.
""Capex increases on the core business are a challenging narrative,"" Mr. Borkhataria said. ""But Exxon's $15 billion dividend is not going to be funded by low-carbon assets anytime soon, so the capital will need to be allocated to the core business for the foreseeable future.""
So far, Exxon has held to its spending cuts. In the Permian, it has reduced the number of rigs it is operating since March of last year by around 85% to less than 10, according to Andrew McConn, an analyst at Enverus, an energy data analytics firm. Chevron has made similar reductions, he said."

Big oil companies are raking in their highest profits since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, but they plan to continue spending sparingly to boost production despite higher commodity prices.
Exxon Mobil Corp. reported $4.7 billion in second quarter profit Friday, while rival Chevron Corp. reported $3.1 billion in quarterly profit.
The results represented a dramatic turnaround from a year earlier, when Exxon reported a quarterly loss of $1.1 billion and Chevron lost $8.3 billion as demand for oil and gas plummeted due to the closing of economies world-wide due to the virus.
Some of the largest European oil companies also reported strong results earlier in the week. Royal Dutch Shell PLC reported $5.5 billion in net income, while TotalEnergies SE posted $3.5 billion in profits.
The oil-and-gas industry has recovered from unprecedented losses in 2020 as economies have reopened this year, sending prices surging to their highest levels in two years. U.S. oil prices have mostly stayed above $60 per barrel since March, after briefly turning negative last April and remaining below $50 for most of 2020. West Texas Intermediate closed at $73.81 on Friday, up 19 cents or 0.3%.
Still, none of the major western producers said they would increase capital spending, as the companies face pressure from investors to moderate their growth and clean up their emissions amid concerns about growing regulations and climate change. Some European companies have promised to let production decline as they invest more in renewable energy.
Exxon cut its annual capital budget last year from $25 billion to $19 billion or less. It said Friday its capital expenditures this year will be closer to $16 billion and that its oil and gas production was down 2% from the same period last year.
""We think we have a good plan on our investments, we're making good progress on debt,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on a call with analysts Friday. ""We are focused on bringing in more profitable, higher value barrels.""
Chevron said Friday it, too, wouldn't raise capital spending. It spent $5.3 billion on capital expenditures in the first six months of 2021, compared with $7.7 billion in the first six months of last year. Chevron previously said it would increase annual production at about 3% or less through 2025 and give priority to returning money to shareholders.

Both companies benefited from strong profits in their chemical businesses as demand for plastics and other products have surged this year. Exxon said its chemical unit had its best quarter on record, reporting $2.3 billion in profits.

Chevron's stock is up more than 20% this year, but down about 4% from February of last year, while Exxon is up nearly 40%, but is down about 5% from pre-pandemic prices. An index of large oil-and-gas company stocks is up about 42% this year, but down around 37% from five years ago.

Chevron has made similar reductions, he said, and neither company has added rigs in recent months even as smaller producers have.
Kevin Holt, senior portfolio manager for Invesco Ltd., said big oil companies must use their cash to pay down debt and ensure their dividends are sustainable.
According to Mr. Holt, there is still enough uncertainty about oil supply and demand to keep commodity prices and producer spending in check for now. Oil prices briefly dipped earlier in July over fears new variants of the Coronavirus will crimp the economic recovery and that OPEC and its allies could increase their production more aggressively. The question, said Mr. Holt, is will the austerity hold.
""Companies are disciplined in 2021, but will they do it in 2022?"" said Mr. Holt. ""What we need out of these companies is conservatism in production and consistency.""

Disbarred attorney Steven Donziger was found guilty of six counts of criminal contempt of court, the latest twist in a nearly three-decade crusade against Chevron Corp. that began as an attempt to prove the oil company caused environmental harm in Ecuador.
The legal saga has since spanned the globe and morphed into a fight between Mr. Donziger and Chevron itself, resulting in Mr. Donziger being put under home confinement for nearly two years as he awaited a trial over charges that he repeatedly flouted court orders.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska found him guilty on all six charges in a nearly 250-page order issued Monday. ""It's time to pay the piper,"" she wrote.
The contempt case, the judge wrote, has nothing to do with any responsibility Chevron might bear for pollution in the rainforest in Ecuador, where Chevron's predecessors drilled for oil in the pristine jungle. The company has denied culpability. Instead, ""at stake here is the fundamental principle that a party to a legal action must abide by court orders or risk criminal sanctions, no matter how fervently he believes in the righteousness of his cause or how much he detests his adversary.""
Mr. Donziger said he plans to appeal the decision, which he said ""marks a sad day for the rule of law, for our democracy and for our planet.""
Sentencing is expected to take place in the coming weeks. Martin Garbus, an attorney for Mr. Donziger, said he expects him to receive the maximum six-month sentence.
Spokesmen for Chevron, which wasn't a party in the case, didn't respond to a request to comment.
Mr. Donziger first went up against Chevron's predecessor Texaco Inc. in the early 1990s, when he represented native Ecuadoreans who claimed the company's operations in the Amazon were sickening them. The legal dispute moved to Ecuador, where a judge in 2011 issued a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron.
The San Ramon, Calif., company has never paid a penny of that and instead spent the ensuing decade fighting back, securing a U.S. court ruling that concluded Mr. Donziger and his colleagues corrupted the legal process in Ecuador by manufacturing evidence, pressuring judges and ultimately ghost writing the final judgment in the case.
That 2014 ruling by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan ordered Mr. Donziger to relinquish his 6.3% contingency fee interest in the Ecuadorean case and forbade him from profiting off the $9.5 billion judgment or trying to enforce it in the U.S.
Mr. Donziger's continued pursuit of the judgment ultimately led to Judge Kaplan finding him in civil contempt of court and later charging him with criminal contempt for, among other things, paying an executive coach with a pledge of 0.007% of any judgment collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share. Judge Kaplan's 2014 findings were later echoed in a disciplinary decision against Mr. Donziger in New York, where he was disbarred last August.

A court-appointed private lawyer, Rita Glavin, served as the prosecutor in the case after the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to pursue it.
Ms. Glavin said Monday that the evidence showed ""Mr. Donziger deliberately disobeyed court order, after court order, after court order simply because he disagreed with them.""
Monday's ruling details years of legal spats in New York courts between Mr. Donziger and Chevron following the Ecuadorean judgment. It also delves into, and refutes, several reasons Mr. Donziger gave as to why he thought his prosecution was unfair and improper, including his perception that judges have been biased against him.
The judge found Mr. Donziger willfully disobeyed several court orders, including in his refusal to turn over his electronic devices to a forensic expert of Chevron's, failure to relinquish his share of the Ecuadorean judgment and failure to turn over his passport when ordered to do so.
Judge Preska said she didn't question Mr. Donziger's sincerity in his Ecuadorean clients' cause, or his belief that he was treated unfairly by Chevron. But, she concluded, ""Contrary to Mr. Donziger's assertion that his conviction was 'pre-ordained,' the Court finds him guilty on each count for one reason and one reason only: Mr. Donziger did that with which he is charged.

NEW YORK -- Steven Donziger once stood to gain hundreds of millions of dollars for winning a $9.5 billion environmental-contamination verdict against Chevron Corp. in Ecuador.
Now, that judgment has been discredited, Mr. Donziger has lost his New York law license, and he is on trial for criminal charges that he flouted a judge's orders.
The contempt-of-court trial that started Monday before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska is the latest twist in a legal saga involving Chevron and Mr. Donziger that has lasted nearly three decades and spanned the globe.
""Steven Donziger. . .has intentionally and repeatedly disobeyed court order after court order after court order,"" Rita Glavin, a private lawyer serving as the prosecutor, said during opening statements Monday.
Martin Garbus, an attorney for Mr. Donziger, said in his opening remarks that his client ""is innocent of every single charge."" He said the court had greenlighted an intimidation campaign by Chevron against Mr. Donziger.
""Mr. Donziger takes his responsibility to his clients, the people of Ecuador"" seriously, Mr. Garbus said.
Mr. Donziger first sued Chevron predecessor Texaco Inc. in New York in 1993 on behalf of native Ecuadoreans who alleged the company's oil operations in the Amazon were sickening them. The dispute later moved to Ecuador, where a judge in 2011 issued the $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based oil company has spent the past decade punching back, securing a U.S. court decision finding that Mr. Donziger and his colleagues corrupted the legal process in Ecuador by manufacturing evidence, pressuring judges and ultimately ghostwriting the final judgment in the case.

Mr. Donziger is now going to trial over his alleged refusal to abide by those orders, and for not complying with Judge Kaplan's order to turn over all his email accounts and electronic devices to a forensic expert for Chevron's eventual use. Judge Kaplan found him in civil contempt of court after Chevron repeatedly told the judge of instances the company said showed he was still profiting from his fraud, including his paying an executive coach with a pledge of 0.007% of any judgment collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share. Judge Kaplan later brought charges of criminal contempt after Mr. Donziger's continued refusal to follow the directives.
""He made the decision not to comply with that judgment from the beginning,"" Ms. Glavin said Monday.
Ms. Glavin and the judge frequently interrupted Mr. Garbus's opening, saying he wasn't addressing issues relevant to the charges at hand.
Mr. Donziger, 59 years old, has been under home confinement in his apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side since Judge Kaplan called for the criminal contempt trial in August 2019. His contempt trial has been delayed repeatedly, both by the coronavirus pandemic and requests by Mr. Donziger to hire new lawyers.

 Trial Begins for Lawyer Who Sued Chevron Over Ecuador Pollution"

Chevron Corp. was fixated on roses.
The giant U.S. oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world's poorest countries, including Ecuador.
A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind.
Chevron had since proved the verdict fraudulent, it told the U.S. Trade Representative. But Ecuador refused to render it unenforceable despite an order to do that from an international arbitration tribunal. Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ""acts of defiance"" would tell the world the U.S. rewards bad behavior, the oil company said.
Chevron lost the war of the roses. But it still hasn't paid a cent of the Ecuadorean judgment, and says it won't stop legally battling until it can ensure that it never has to.
""We're going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it on the ice,"" a former Chevron general counsel, Charles James, said before his retirement in 2010, a remark that became a watchword at the company.
His successor, R. Hewitt Pate, said this spring that ""only the government of Ecuador could deliver a final resolution of this case,"" by nullifying the verdict.
Big companies that see lawsuits against them as unfounded often reach a point, after losing a court ruling or two, when settling seems the sensible course. Chevron never did. Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights on.
Chevron's opponents also refuse to back down, making the case what appears to be the oil industry's longest-running legal slugfest. Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron's estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff, advisers' and attorneys' time. Executives and lawyers who worked on the case have retired or died since it began.
Well before Chevron lost the damage verdict in 2011, it set out to turn the tables on the litigants. It subpoenaed or sued dozens of people who had helped the plaintiffs' side, legal records show, and unearthed damaging video clips about the plaintiffs' legal team's activities from documentary-film outtakes. Chevron's lawyers obtained the personal notes of the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Steven Donziger.
It scored a victory in 2014 when a federal judge found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and ghost-wrote the verdict.
Mr. Donziger's New York law license was revoked. He is confined to his apartment, facing trial over his refusal to turn over records to Chevron.
In December, he shouted out his window to supporters gathered below to mark his 500th day of house arrest. ""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!""
The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview.
Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdict -- a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague -- to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador.
Inigo Salvador Crespo, an Ecuador justice official, declined to comment.
Chevron officials say they have punched back so hard, for so long, because they found fraud in the litigation and because Ecuador in the 1990s granted a release from liability after a cleanup.
To some longtime observers of the case, it looks more like a grudge match with Mr. Donziger. ""They're making an example of him,"" said Ted Folkman, an attorney who has closely followed the battle.
Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the other side won't acknowledge court findings.
Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the plaintiffs, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling.
""Chevron wants to talk about the injustices they have suffered. Steven wants to talk about the injustice he is suffering. Who is talking about the people on the ground and how they've been affected?"" said Judith Kimerling, a professor at the City University of New York's Queens College, whose research in Ecuador inspired the original lawsuit.
Chevron inherited the dispute in 2001 when it acquired Texaco Inc., which operated in Ecuador from the 1960s to 1990 with government-run Petroecuador. They drilled in an area of the Amazon occupied by native people and gave it the name Lago Agrio.
Texaco spent $40 million on local cleanup and obtained a liability release from Ecuador's government in the 1990s.
A group of Amazonians sued Texaco in 1993 in federal court in New York, saying they were sickened by water and air polluted from the oil operations. Texaco said the case belonged in Ecuador, and a new suit was filed there in 2003. A new Ecuadorean law let people sue not only for harm to themselves but also for environmental damage.
Mr. Donziger became the face of the case in Ecuador. He rallied activists in front of the Lago Agrio courthouse. A documentary film crew followed him as he barged into judges' offices to make demands.
Around 2009, Chevron adopted a strategy of trying to show plaintiffs' lawyers were acting improperly. It hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, whose lawyers probed every aspect of plaintiffs' case. Using an obscure court process called Section 1782, Gibson Dunn gained access to troves of documents from people who had worked with the plaintiffs.
Chevron secured the outtakes of a documentary film on the case and turned up clips such as one where Mr. Donziger recounted a favorite quote to colleagues: ""Facts do not exist. Facts are created.""
It amassed evidence that Mr. Donziger and his team had pressured Ecuadorean judges to rule in their favor and secretly wrote the bulk of the report of a court-appointed outside expert who said Chevron should pay $27.3 billion.
Mr. Donziger said the plaintiffs' activities followed Ecuadorean court customs.
Gibson Dunn pitched federal prosecutors in New York on the idea of criminally prosecuting Mr. Donziger. When they declined, Chevron sued Mr. Donziger and his team civilly under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, often used against mobsters. It filed the RICO suit on Feb. 1, 2011.
Two weeks later, a judge in Ecuador handed down the verdict against Chevron, then doubled the damages to $19 billion after Chevron refused an order to apologize. It was later reduced back to $9.5 billion but otherwise upheld by the Ecuadorean courts.
With Chevron having no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to collect in places where the oil company operated, such as Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Chevron hired lawyers around the world to resist such efforts.
Its strategy was vindicated in March 2014 when, after a trial, a federal judge issued a 485-page opinion concluding Mr. Donziger and his team had submitted false evidence in Ecuador, paid off a court-appointed expert and ghost-written much of his opinion and promised $500,000 to an Ecuadorean judge to rule in their favor. The ruling by Judge Lewis Kaplan had ramifications: Mr. Donziger couldn't try to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment in the U.S. or profit from it; he had to relinquish his 6.3% interest. Mr. Donziger appealed the ruling and lost.
Chevron lawyers filed motions every time they thought Mr. Donziger might be violating the judge's orders. An example was when he asked a hedge-fund firm to finance efforts to collect the damages in return for a share of them.
A portfolio manager at Elliott Management Corp. said Mr. Donziger told him the plaintiffs had raised $33 million, and 15% to 20% of the damage award was committed to investors and others. Elliott turned him down, the portfolio manager said in a sworn affidavit. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment.
Chevron also told the court Mr. Donziger had hired an executive coach and agreed to pay him 0.007% of what was collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share. Chevron said that violated the ban on his profiting from the verdict.
In May 2019, Judge Kaplan found Mr. Donziger in civil contempt of court. The judge said he violated orders by not turning over all of his electronic devices and email accounts for imaging, for failing to relinquish his stake in the damage award and for his deal with the executive coach.
Later, Judge Kaplan ordered a trial to determine if Mr. Donziger should be held in criminal contempt of court for ignoring the orders. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office declined to pursue the criminal matter. In an unusual procedure, Judge Kaplan then appointed a private lawyer to serve as prosecutor and assigned another U.S. district judge, Loretta Preska, to handle the case, which is set for trial starting May 10. It was Judge Preska who put Mr. Donziger under house arrest.
A state appellate court had suspended Mr. Donziger's law license. He requested a hearing. There, 15 witnesses testified about the honest human-rights lawyer they said they knew, among them Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, a co-founder of Greenpeace and an indigenous Ecuadorean leader. Chevron sent observers.
A New York judicial official found Mr. Donziger posed no threat to the public and recommended letting him keep his license. ""The extent of his pursuit by Chevron is so extravagant, and at this point so unnecessary and punitive,"" the official said.
New York state's appellate court said the official was too dismissive of the severity of the misconduct. It disbarred Mr. Donziger in August. He is seeking an appeal.
For years, Chevron separately pursued an international arbitration case. The company argued that Ecuador's government had violated an investment treaty with the U.S., both by not upholding the liability release granted in the 1990s and later by allowing a fraudulent court verdict to stand.
In 2018 the arbitration panel sided with Chevron. It ordered Ecuador to wipe out all consequences of the court verdict and preclude anyone from enforcing it, on grounds it was obtained fraudulently.
Though Ecuador hasn't done this, Chevron officials point to instances where, they say, its representatives have admitted the verdict was fraudulent.
In one, Ecuador's ambassador told the U.S. Trade Representative in a letter last July that Ecuador had been in touch with authorities in countries where plaintiffs sought to enforce what she called ""the fraudulent Lago Agrio judgment.""
The letter from the ambassador, Ivonne Baki, added that Ecuador didn't know what steps it could take to satisfy the arbitration order, saying its laws and international law constrained it from intervening in the court system. Efforts to reach Ms. Baki for comment were unsuccessful.
Investors in Chevron appear to have largely ignored the judgment's potential financial impact. But its chief executive, Michael Wirth, continues to face questions about the case.
At a virtual shareholders' meeting in May 2020, the actor Alec Baldwin told the CEO Chevron was using shareholders' money to personally attack Mr. Donziger. Mr. Wirth called Mr. Baldwin's summary of the case false and offensive, saying: ""Mr. Donziger is an adjudicated racketeer.""
There have been no settlement discussions since 2012. At a meeting that year, held while the damage award was temporarily doubled to $19 billion, Mr. Pate walked out after the plaintiffs' side proposed a nearly $10 billion settlement, according to Mr. Donziger. Chevron didn't dispute that account.
Said Dylan Mefford, a California attorney who worked on the case as a Gibson Dunn associate: ""Both sides genuinely felt the others were criminals.""

Chevron Corp. was fixated on roses.
The giant U.S. oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world's poorest countries, including Ecuador.
A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind.
Chevron had since proved the verdict fraudulent, it told the U.S. Trade Representative. But Ecuador refused to render it unenforceable despite an order to do that from an international arbitration tribunal. Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ""acts of defiance"" would tell the world the U.S. rewards bad behavior, the oil company said.
Chevron lost the war of the roses. But it still hasn't paid a cent of the Ecuadorean judgment, and says it won't stop legally battling until it can ensure that it never has to.
""We're going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it on the ice,"" a former Chevron general counsel, Charles James, said before his retirement in 2010, a remark that became a watchword at the company.
His successor, R. Hewitt Pate, said this spring that ""only the government of Ecuador could deliver a final resolution of this case,"" by nullifying the verdict.
Big companies that see lawsuits against them as unfounded often reach a point, after losing a court ruling or two, when settling seems the sensible course. Chevron never did. Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights on—pressing to make sure that lawyer doesn't profit from the case, hiring attorneys in countries where it operates and where plaintiffs might try to collect, trying to force Ecuador to pay its legal costs and, as with the roses, asking the U.S. government to penalize Ecuador in the trade arena.
Chevron's opponents also refuse to back down, making the case what appears to be the oil industry's longest-running legal slugfest. Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron's estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff, advisers' and attorneys' time. Executives and lawyers who worked on the case have retired or died since it began.
Although the oil industry's era of global power seems to have peaked, for Chevron part of that era—costly, intractable environmental-pollution litigation—continues unabated. The Ecuador legal fight has lasted even longer than the one that followed the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
Well before Chevron lost the damage verdict in 2011, it set out to turn the tables on the litigants. It subpoenaed or sued dozens of people who had helped the plaintiffs' side, legal records show, and unearthed damaging video clips about the plaintiffs' legal team's activities from documentary-film outtakes. Chevron's lawyers obtained the personal notes of the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Steven Donziger, and used his own words against him.
The company scored a seminal victory in 2014 when a federal judge in New York found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and had ghost-written the court verdict .
Mr. Donziger's New York law license was revoked. He faces a criminal contempt-of-court trial this month over his refusal to turn over records to Chevron as ordered. His bank accounts were frozen. He has been under house arrest for nearly two years, unable to leave his Manhattan apartment without court permission, an ankle bracelet tracking his every move.
In December, Mr. Donziger shouted out his window to supporters gathered below to mark his 500th day of detention. ""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!""
The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview. ""This idea they've won and I've lost is their view, not my view.""
Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdict—a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague—to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron's stock-market value.
Íñigo Salvador Crespo, an Ecuador justice official whose agency represents the country in the dispute, declined to comment, saying to do so could compromise its legal strategy. A newly elected president of Ecuador who hasn't yet taken office, Guillermo Lasso, didn't respond to requests for comment on the dispute.
Chevron officials say they have punched back so hard, for so long, because they found fraud in the litigation and because Ecuador in the 1990s granted a release from liability after a cleanup.
""This was never for Chevron one of these things where we added up potential liability and said we have to fight this because the number is too much,"" Mr. James, the former general counsel, said in an interview.
To some longtime observers of the case, it looks more like a grudge match with Mr. Donziger, who has refused to concede anything despite a series of court losses. ""They're making an example of him,"" said Ted Folkman, an attorney who has closely followed the legal battle. As the years go on, he said, ""it's not being done for reasons that look rational.""
Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the ""perpetrators of the fraud"" refuse to acknowledge court and arbitration findings.
Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the original plaintiffs, natives of the forested northeast of Ecuador, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling.
""Chevron wants to talk about the injustices they have suffered. Steven wants to talk about the injustice he is suffering. Who is talking about the people on the ground and how they've been affected?"" said Judith Kimerling, a professor of environmental law and policy at the City University of New York's Queens College, whose research in Ecuador inspired the original lawsuit.
Chevron inherited the already eight-year-old dispute in 2001 when it acquired Texaco Inc., which operated in Ecuador from the 1960s to 1990 in partnership with government-run Petroecuador. They drilled in an area of the Amazon occupied only by native people and migrant farmers, and gave it the name Lago Agrio.
Texaco spent $40 million on local cleanup and obtained a liability release from Ecuador's government in the 1990s. Chevron says that means any remaining pollution is the responsibility of its state-owned former partner.
A group of Amazonians sued Texaco in 1993 in federal court in New York, saying they were sickened by water and air polluted from the oil operations. Texaco said the suit belonged in Ecuador, a judge agreed, and a new suit was filed there in 2003. This suit took advantage of a newly passed Ecuadorean law that allowed individuals to sue not only for harm to themselves but also for damage to the environment.
Mr. Donziger, a former public defender fluent in Spanish, joined the plaintiffs' team early on and became the face of the case in Ecuador, with a strategy that relied heavily on swaying public opinion. He rallied activists in front of the Lago Agrio courthouse. A documentary film crew followed him as he barged into judges' offices to make demands.
The plaintiffs' side brought journalists to villages where residents lived alongside drilling waste in unlined pits. Chevron put on counter-tours to sites reflecting Texaco's cleanup.
Around 2009, Chevron adopted a strategy of trying to show that plaintiffs' lawyers were acting improperly. It hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a law firm that had helped Dole Food Co. defeat litigation by Nicaraguan banana farmers who claimed to be left sterile by Dole pesticides; Gibson Dunn convinced a U.S. judge lawyers had recruited plaintiffs who weren't sterile or didn't even work on a Dole banana property.
For Chevron, a Gibson Dunn team led by Randy Mastro, once a top aide to Rudy Giuliani when he was New York City mayor, probed every aspect of the plaintiffs' case. Using an obscure court process called Section 1782, which allows parties to seek evidence in the U.S. to help with foreign lawsuits, Gibson Dunn gained access to troves of internal documents from people who had worked with the plaintiffs.
Chevron secured the outtakes of a documentary film on the case and turned up clips such as one where Mr. Donziger recounted a favorite quote to colleagues: ""Facts do not exist. Facts are created.""
It also amassed evidence that Mr. Donziger and his team had pressured Ecuadorean judges to rule in their favor and secretly wrote the bulk of the report of a court-appointed outside expert who said Chevron should pay $27.3 billion. 
Mr. Donziger said the plaintiffs' activities followed Ecuadorean court customs.
In a conference room in lower Manhattan in 2010, Gibson Dunn pitched federal prosecutors on the idea of criminally prosecuting Mr. Donziger. They declined, figuring this was a squabble between a corporation and well-funded adversaries that wasn't worth their limited resources, said a person familiar with the meeting.
Chevron then civilly sued Mr. Donziger and his team under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law often used against mobsters. It filed the RICO suit on Feb. 1, 2011.
Two weeks later, a judge in Ecuador handed down the verdict against Chevron, then doubled the damages to $19 billion after Chevron refused an order to apologize. It was later reduced back to $9.5 billion but otherwise upheld by the Ecuadorean courts .
With Chevron refusing to pay, and having no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to collect in places where the oil company operated, such as Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Chevron hired lawyers around the world to resist such efforts.

Even if they sought to help native people, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, ""they were not entitled to corrupt the process to achieve their goal.""
The ruling came with ramifications: Mr. Donziger couldn't try to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment in the U.S. and he couldn't profit from it; he had to relinquish his 6.3% interest in any payout.
Mr. Donziger appealed the ruling and lost . ""I believe it is invalid, though I recognize courts have found otherwise,"" he said.
Chevron lawyers filed motions every time they thought Mr. Donziger might be violating the judge's orders. An example was when he asked a hedge-fund firm to finance efforts to collect the damages in return for a share of them.
A portfolio manager at Elliott Management Corp. said Mr. Donziger told him the plaintiffs had raised $33 million, and 15% to 20% of the damage award was committed to investors and others.

The judge said he violated orders by not turning over all of his electronic devices and email accounts for imaging, for failing to relinquish his stake in the damage award and for his deal with the executive coach.
Two months later, Judge Kaplan ordered a trial to determine whether Mr. Donziger should be held in criminal contempt of court for continuing to ignore the orders.
The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, to which the judge referred the criminal matter, declined to pursue it. In an unusual procedure, Judge Kaplan then appointed a private lawyer to serve as prosecutor and assigned another U.S. district judge, Loretta Preska, to handle the case, which is set for trial starting May 10. It was Judge Preska who put Mr. Donziger under house arrest, deeming him a flight risk.
A state appellate court had already suspended Mr. Donziger's law license. He requested a public hearing on that. There, 15 witnesses testified about the honest human-rights lawyer they said they knew, among them Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, a co-founder of Greenpeace and an indigenous Ecuadorean leader. Chevron sent a team to observe.
A New York judicial official found Mr. Donziger posed no threat to the public and recommended letting him keep his license. Describing him as ""often his own worst enemy,"" the official said: ""The extent of his pursuit by Chevron is so extravagant, and at this point so unnecessary and punitive.""
The opinion wasn't binding. New York state's appellate court said the official was too dismissive of the severity of the misconduct, and it disbarred Mr. Donziger last August. He is seeking an appeal of the decision.

Big oil companies returned to profitability during the first quarter as they recovered from the unprecedented destruction of oil and gas demand wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Exxon Mobil Corp. reported $2.7 billion in net income Friday, its first quarterly profit since the pandemic erupted last spring, while Chevron Corp. reported $1.4 billion in first-quarter profit. The results were boosted by rising oil prices during the first months of 2021, as countries around the world soften coronavirus quarantines.
The largest European oil companies, BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SE, all reported profits earlier in the week after enduring huge losses last year.
""That recovery, which we had anticipated happening at some point in time, is happening sooner than we anticipated,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in an interview Friday. ""As economies are reopening and rebounding quicker, in some places, than expected, we are seeing a demand response.""
Oil companies endured one of their worst years on record in 2020, as Covid-19 lockdowns choked off demand for oil and gas as road and air traffic fell precipitously. Exxon reported its first annual loss in modern history in 2020 of about $22 billion. But cautious optimism has been mounting that global economic activity could return to pre-pandemic levels later this year as vaccines become more widely available.
Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said that demand for gasoline and diesel was nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, and that jet fuel is the last remaining overhang, with strong signs that domestic air travel in the U.S. is picking up. ""As we look forward, the next couple of quarters look very good,"" Mr. Breber said. ""We feel good about our ability to generate cash.""
Chevron's net income was down about 62% from the same quarter last year, but was a substantial increase from a $665 million loss in the previous quarter. Exxon's $2.7 billion profit compared with a $610 million loss a year ago. BP's profit more than tripled from the previous quarter to nearly $4.7 billion, and Shell reported a profit of almost $5.7 billion.
Share prices for the world's largest energy companies have moved in tandem with oil prices that have rebounded markedly in recent months. U.S. oil prices are up about 77% over the past six months, while the shares of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell are collectively up about 60%.
On Thursday, U.S. oil prices neared a six-week high of about $65 a barrel but fell around 2.6% Friday as traders eyed a build in crude and gasoline stockpiles. The share prices of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell were collectively down nearly 2% Friday.
The optimism about oil and gas demand rebounding is being tempered by concerns about rapidly rising Covid-19 case numbers in India and South America, said Bjornar Tonhaugen, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Reduced economic activity in India alone may sap as much as 900,000 barrels of oil a day from global demand, according to Rystad. ""For the moment optimism is helping prices, but every trader's eyes are on India,"" Mr. Tonhaugen said.
In response to growing profits, Chevron, BP and Shell boosted payouts to investors. Chevron increased its quarterly dividend by 4%, while Shell raised its dividend 4%, the second increase since slashing it last year. BP said it would buy back $500 million of shares. Total and Exxon held their dividends flat.
The weeklong freeze in Texas that left millions without power in February affected profits for many of the companies, which both produce oil in the state and own plants there to convert the hydrocarbons into fuels and plastics.
Chevron's refining and chemical units reported $5 million in profits, down from $1.1 billion a year ago, which Chevron CEO Mike Wirth attributed to the February storm and continuing impact of the pandemic. In total, the storm cut about $300 million from its profit, Chevron said. Exxon said the extreme weather reduced earnings by nearly $600 million. Meanwhile, analysts attributed the strong performance of BP's trading unit to its ability to capitalize on substantial price fluctuations during the storm.
Despite the improving conditions, Chevron has pledged to keep capital expenditures austere. Mr. Wirth said capital spending decreased 43% from last year during the quarter, citing its corporate restructuring last year that saw as much as 15% of its workforce laid off.
Exxon also has pledged fiscal restraint, saying its plan to cut annual capital spending by about 30% remains unchanged."

Attorney Steven Donziger was disbarred and rebuked by U.S. courts for a $9.5 billion shakedown of Chevron in Ecuador. But now as he faces criminal contempt charges, progressives are lionizing him as a human-rights martyr.
Readers may recall Mr. Donziger's legal and media campaign against Texaco (now merged with Chevron) for its alleged failure to clean up oil pits from its work in Ecuador during the 1970s. Chevron claimed it had cleaned up the pits, but Mr. Donziger used legal chicanery to obtain a $9.5 billion judgment in Ecuador.
Chevron fought back in U.S. court and won. Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan (a Clinton appointee) in 2014 excoriated Mr. Donziger in a 485-page ruling for engaging in judicial bribery, coercion, money-laundering, witness tampering and hiring an American consulting firm to ghostwrite an expert's report, among other legal misconduct.
A Second Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Judge Kaplan's ruling. Yet Mr. Donziger defied the judge's orders by selling shares in the Ecuador judgment, which he has unsuccessfully sought to enforce in foreign courts. Judge Kaplan has referred Mr. Donziger to stand trial for criminal contempt after he continued to flout court orders.
But progressives are now lobbying to get him off the hook. ""It is vital that attorneys working on behalf of victims of human rights violations and negative environmental impacts of corporations not become criminalized for their work,"" Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Rashida Tlaib, Jamaal Bowman, Jamie Raskin and James McGovern wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland this week.
They want the AG to intervene in Mr. Donziger's case, explaining in their letter that his ""efforts [in Ecuador] were crucial in elevating the claims and grievances of [indigenous] communities, and his work is an important contribution in ensuring that Black, brown, and Indigenous communities across the world are represented in our legal systems.""
Mr. Donziger exploited indigenous people and the legal system of a foreign country to loot a U.S. company. He refused to comply with a court's orders. Apparently the Congress-folk believe you can show contempt for the law as long you're fighting fossil fuels.

The results were boosted by rising oil prices during the first months of 2021, as countries around the world soften coronavirus quarantines.
The largest European oil companies, BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Total SE, all reported profits earlier in the week after enduring huge losses last year.
""That recovery, which we had anticipated happening at some point in time, is happening sooner than we anticipated,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said in an interview Friday. ""As economies are reopening and rebounding quicker, in some places, than expected, we are seeing a demand response.""
Oil companies endured one of their worst years on record in 2020, as Covid-19 lockdowns choked off demand for oil and gas as road and air traffic fell precipitously. Exxon reported its first annual loss in modern history in 2020 of about $22 billion.
But cautious optimism has been mounting that global economic activity could return to pre-pandemic levels later this year as vaccines become more widely available around the world.
Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said that demand for gasoline and diesel was nearly back to pre-pandemic levels, and that jet fuel is the last remaining overhang, with strong signs that domestic air travel in the U.S. is picking up.
""As we look forward, the next couple of quarters look very good,"" Mr. Breber said in an interview. ""We feel good about our ability to generate cash.""
Chevron's net income was down about 62% from the same quarter last year, but was a substantial increase from a $665 million loss in the previous quarter. Exxon's $2.7 billion profit compared with a $610 million loss a year ago. BP's profit more than tripled from the previous quarter to nearly $4.7 billion, and Shell reported a profit of almost $5.7 billion.
Share prices for the world's largest energy companies have moved in tandem with oil prices that have rebounded markedly in recent months. U.S. oil prices are up about 77% over the past six months, while the shares of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell are collectively up about 60%.
On Thursday, U.S. oil prices neared a six-week high of about $65 a barrel but fell around 2.6% Friday as traders eyed a build in crude and gasoline stockpiles. The share prices of Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell were collectively down nearly 2% Friday.
The optimism about oil and gas demand rebounding is being tempered by concerns about rapidly rising Covid-19 case numbers in India and South America, said Bjornar Tonhaugen, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Reduced economic activity in India alone may sap as much as 900,000 barrels of oil a day from global demand, according to Rystad.
""For the moment optimism is helping prices, but every trader's eyes are on India,"" Mr. Tonhaugen said. ""The oil bulls are out again but it's doubtful that they are having a confident and calm sleep.""
In response to growing profits, Chevron, BP and Shell boosted their payouts to investors. On Wednesday, Chevron increased its quarterly dividend by 4%, while Shell also raised its dividend 4%, the second increase since slashing it last year. BP said it would buy back $500 million of shares. Total and Exxon held their dividends flat.
The weeklong freeze in Texas that left millions without power in February affected profits for many of the companies , which both produce oil in the state and own plants there to convert the hydrocarbons into fuels and plastics.
Chevron's refining and chemical units reported $5 million in profits, down from $1.1 billion a year ago, which Chevron CEO Mike Wirth attributed to the February storm and continuing impact of the pandemic. In total, the storm cut about $300 million from its profit, Chevron said.
Exxon said the extreme weather reduced earnings by nearly $600 million. Meanwhile, analysts attributed the strong performance of BP's trading unit to its ability to capitalize on substantial price fluctuations during the storm.
Despite the improving conditions, Chevron has pledged to keep capital expenditures austere. Mr. Wirth said capital spending decreased 43% from last year during the quarter, citing its corporate restructuring last year that saw as much as 15% of its workforce laid off. Exxon also has pledged fiscal restraint, saying its plan to cut annual capital spending by about 30% remains unchanged.
Oil Giants During the Pandemic
Some investors are deeply skeptical of the industry notwithstanding climbing commodity prices, according to Paul Sankey, an independent oil and gas analyst. Most of the companies' share prices are still trading below their pre-pandemic levels as investors evaluate the firms' plans to navigate tightening global regulations on carbon emissions.
Earlier this month, President Biden pledged to cut U.S. emissions by about 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, targeting greenhouse gases from power plants, buildings and the transportation sector. Mr. Woods said Friday that Exxon is engaging with officials on climate policy and has urged the government to set a price on carbon, which it says would spur investment in carbon-reducing technologies.
Mr. Sankey said the industry delivered poor results for years from their core oil business before the pandemic, leaving some to doubt they can reap profits from renewable energy or technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which some of the companies have promised to do .
""Their track record is not good enough for them to get into a new theme, because they did so poorly on the old one,"" Mr. Sankey said.

| Jump to first hit The Department of Energy (DOE) has approved the sale and transfer of Chevron Malampaya LLC's entire 45-percent stake in the Malampaya gas consortium to UC Malampaya Pte. Ltd. owned by Davao businessman Dennis Uy.
The sale, which was finalized in March last year, is worth $565 million, according to DOE officials who made it public during a senate hearing held in November last year. Back then, lawmakers were alarmed by UC's sizable stake in the gas field, which may have implications on security of the country's power supply.
Energy Assistant Secretary Leonido J. Pulido III, who represented the agency in the Senate hearings that tackled the gas industry, said the Chevron-Udenna sale would be considered final and concluded once the DOE approves it.
On Wednesday, UC expressed its appreciation of the DOE's approval of the transfer of rights and obligations of Chevron Malampaya LLC, now UC38 LLC, to UC Malampaya under Service Contract No.38.
SC 38 was awarded to Shell Philippines Exploration (45 percent), Chevron Corp. (45 percent) and PNOC Exploration Corp. (10 percent). The service contract will expire in 2024 unless the DOE extends it. With only 3 years left, the government is faced with a daunting task to discover another petroleum field the size of the Malampaya gas field.
'We reiterate our company's commitment to support the country's energy agenda on security, self-reliance and use of cleaner energy sources, and the DOE's approval of the transfer of rights is a welcome progress to reach this end,' said Dennis A. Uy, Chairman and CEO of Udenna Corp.
The Malampaya consortium safeguards the nation's energy security by producing gas, which generates a fifth of the Philippines's rapidly growing electricity needs. As a consortium partner, UC38 works closely with SPEX, the current operator, and the Philippine National Oil Company-Exploration Corp. (PNOC-EC).
UC Malampaya now officially holds the 45 percent of the Malampaya gas project.
'We are committed to the safe, reliable and sustainable development of the gas-to-power industry in the Philippines through Malampaya. UC38 continues to be led by the highly qualified team who were previously with Chevron and provide us with upstream technical, operational, and commercial expertise based on global industry best practices,' said Uy.
'We are proud to be part of the successful Malampaya public-private partnership, providing indigenous, affordable and clean energy to secure the energy future of the Philippines. We will continue to explore the best avenue to provide a continuous and sustainable supply to meet the growing demand for cleaner power generation.'
UC Malampaya also expressed interest to acquire the 45-percent operating interest of Royal Dutch Shell's domestic exploration unit in Malampaya, alongside the PNOC-EC.
If and when Udenna Malampaya once again secures an additional 45-percent, lawmakers are concerned about how the Uy-led firm would be able to operate the multibillion dollar deep water gas-to-power project considering its lack of technical capability and experience in the oil and gas industry. Udenna Malampaya's corporate papers showed that the company was established only last year.
'The goal is to assure the country's energy security. How do you do that? One, make sure the operator is technically qualified. Two, it must also be qualified to look for future gas resources because the Malampaya gas field is running low. In short, it should be qualified to operate the existing gas platform and qualified to explore and develop future gas resources. These are the two most important goals,' said Senate Energy Committee Chairman Sherwin Gatchalian."

Facebook Inc.
Washington is turning up the heat on Silicon Valley. In a combative House hearing Thursday , the leaders of Facebook, Twitter Inc., Alphabet Inc. and its Google unit were accused of running platforms that sow political discord and spread Covid-19 misinformation and lacking accountability. The hearing built momentum for revisions of Section 230, the law shielding platforms from liability for users' content. Facebook shares fell 1.2% Thursday, Twitter shares lost 1.4% and Alphabet shares ended flat.
Apollo Global Management Inc.
The Leon Black era at Apollo is officially over. The billionaire is stepping down as its chairman amid a governance overhaul kicked off by revelations of his ties to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. The firm previously said Mr. Black would stay in the chairman's seat while relinquishing his role as chief executive. Mr. Black cited his and his wife's health issues in announcing his decision Monday. An independent review previously revealed that Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $158 million for tax- and estate-planning services, far more than was previously known. Apollo also said Monday that co-founder Marc Rowan has formally assumed the title of CEO, a transition the firm said in January would take place before July 31. Apollo shares rose 4.5% Monday.
Microsoft Corp.
Microsoft is close to a deal that could boost its videogame business and social-network presence. As of Thursday, Microsoft is in advanced talks to acquire messaging platform Discord Inc. for $10 billion or more as the software giant seeks to deepen its consumer offerings. Originally favored by gamers, Discord offers voice, text and video chatting. The platform's popularity has surged since the pandemic took hold as people stay home and connect online. Microsoft has been looking to reach more consumers; it held talks last summer to buy the popular video-sharing app TikTok amid a high-profile geopolitical standoff prompted by the Trump administration before abandoning the effort. Microsoft shares gained 1.8% Friday.
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Warren Buffett wants to build emergency power plants in Texas after February's devastating blackouts. His conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is pitching Texas lawmakers on a $8.3 billion plan to build 10 large natural-gas plants that would operate only during times of extreme need, and not otherwise compete in the state's power market. The Texas Legislature would need to approve changes to its laws to allow for a new regulated utility to provide emergency backup power. Meanwhile, some rival power generators such as NRG Energy Inc. expressed opposition and anger to the proposed idea. Berkshire Hathaway shares added 2.4% Friday.
Darden Restaurants Inc.
Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse are serving up higher pay. Starting Monday, hourly restaurant workers at both dining chains will earn at least $10 an hour in wages and tips combined , with further increases to $12 an hour to be phased in through 2023. The raise makes Darden Restaurants, the brands' parent company, the latest business to institute a wage floor higher than the federally mandated minimum. The company said that, on average, its hourly restaurant workers already earned more than $17 an hour in combined wages and tips. Darden also said it would give those workers a bonus to reward their work during the pandemic, setting aside $17 million for the one-time payments. Darden shares gained 8.2% Thursday.
Intel Corp.
Intel's new chief executive wants to reboot the semiconductor giant. The broad plan mixes increased outsourcing with a commitment to spend $20 billion on new factories that could help address a chip shortage. CEO Pat Gelsinger said Tuesday that Intel would rely more heavily on third-party chip-making partners, including for some of its most cutting-edge processors, starting in 2023. But Mr. Gelsinger said Intel wasn't abandoning its historic roots of being both a designer and manufacturer of chips and would retain most production in-house. The company is also renewing efforts to make chips for others and targeting customers such as Apple Inc. and chip rival Qualcomm Inc., he said. Intel shares fell 2.3% Wednesday.
Chevron Corp.
The fallout from the Suez Canal blockage is spreading through the oil and gas industry . The cost of renting tankers is rising and shippers are starting to plot alternative routes for supplies of oil and gas, after a giant vessel became stuck on one of the world's busiest shipping arteries. The 120-mile Suez Canal, which connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, is a vital route for tankers carrying oil and natural gas, and Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell PLC were among the companies with chartered vessels stuck. The blockage comes as global supply lines grapple with the pandemic's continuing effects , a global shortage of computer chips and adverse weather. Chevron shares added 0.4% Thursday.

SINGAPORE—Foreign businesses in Myanmar are struggling to operate in an increasingly volatile environment, as the military uses lethal violence against a swelling protest movement opposing last month's coup and swaths of the country's workforce go on strike.
Bank employees and port workers aren't punching in, part of a massive civil-disobedience campaign meant to pressure the military regime to restore elected government. That has paralyzed Myanmar's financial system and logistics arteries, with executives scrambling to work out how to pay salaries and import raw materials.
Migrant workers have been fleeing industrial areas near Yangon, the country's largest city, since security forces gunned down at least 37 demonstrators there on March 14 and flames tore through Chinese-owned garment factories amid the chaos.
Energy giants Total SE and Chevron Corp., which have business ties with a state-owned company, are under pressure to prevent revenue from flowing to the army that controls the government.
""For businesses in general the conditions are pretty unworkable,"" said a senior U.N. official based in Myanmar. ""There's a sense of impending doom.""
The Feb. 1 coup ended Myanmar's decadelong transition toward democracy. Police and soldiers have responded with horrific violence to the protests that followed, killing at least 247 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a nonprofit that monitors arrests and fatalities.
Reduced investment by foreign companies might not shift the military's calculus, analysts focused on Myanmar say, because the army appears more motivated by political primacy than economic development. The generals withstood decades of economic sanctions—lifted gradually over the past 10 years during the democratic shift—and are accustomed to ruling under international isolation.
Still, an economic collapse caused by widespread strikes, potentially amplified by a threat of foreign investors exiting, would create challenges for them. Sectors such as apparel and infrastructure have attracted substantial investment over the past decade, especially from Asian countries, and employ hundreds of thousands of workers.
Myanmar in Turmoil
Some foreign companies are relocating staff who live near protest hot spots to secure hotels and are encouraging nonessential expatriate employees to leave the country, according to Jack Mullan, chief executive of Singapore-based risk-management firm Barber Mullan and Associates, which advises foreign businesses there.
Even basic tasks have become complicated. Companies that typically wire money from elsewhere in Asia to pay wages are finding that, with many banks in Myanmar closed, transfers aren't going through. Mr. Mullan said a transfer he made to a private Myanmar bank on March 2 has yet to clear.
""It's a big stress for many companies—how will they get cash at the end of the month?"" he said.
Dale Buckner, chief executive of McLean, Va.-based security-services company Global Guardian, said his firm has a workaround to help its seven large corporate clients in Myanmar: It wires funds to a broker in Singapore who has cash on hand in Myanmar, and the cash is then delivered in bundles to the offices of the Myanmar clients. The total delivered has reached about $2.5 million, and the broker's fee has risen to 25%, Mr. Buckner said, from 12% six weeks ago.
Since early March, clothing brands that source garments from Myanmar, such as Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz AB and Italy's Benetton Group SRL, have paused new orders, citing concerns over instability. Garment manufacturers, whose production accounts for roughly one-quarter of the country's exports, say it is becoming harder to staff factories. Thousands of workers have fled two of Yangon's industrial suburbs since the March 14 protests that left dozens dead.
""My parents are worried for us,"" said Ma Thida, 33 years old, a sewing operator at a Chinese-owned factory, who returned to her rural family home.
Despite the risk, anticoup protests have drawn citizens from all layers of society . One Western businessman in Yangon said some of his employees regularly attend them during working hours. ""It's very difficult to tell them not to go,"" he said.
Workers at Dutch beverage giant Heineken NV, which has a brewery in Myanmar, have pressed the company to stop forwarding to the government the income tax it deducts from employee salaries, as a way to deny the military funding, according to Heineken employees in Yangon.
A business analyst in Yangon familiar with the situation said companies like Heineken face a quandary: Break the law by not delivering the tax money, or risk being branded pro-military—and perhaps suffering boycotts—by delivering it over employee objections.
""All companies are having this problem,"" the analyst said. ""Staff are saying, 'We don't want to pay income tax.' ""
A spokeswoman for Heineken said after this article was published initially that the company was ""committed to complying with the law and paying taxes to ensure we can continue to operate,"" but added that ""given the current situation in Myanmar"" the company has requested a deferment of its tax payments.
Some are finding a third way. A Yangon-based Western lawyer said he knows of several businesses that are offering protesting staff the option of becoming independent contractors, making the workers responsible for delivering their own income taxes to the government. They can choose not to, without implicating the company.
Multinationals working with state-owned businesses are finding it harder to escape scrutiny. Activists and a group representing ousted Myanmar legislators have called on French energy company Total—whose operations in Myanmar waters supply gas for the domestic market and for export to neighboring Thailand—to stop transferring revenue to its state-owned partner Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise. The legislators' group said in a letter to Total that continuing the payments would fund the junta.
Human-rights campaigners are asking energy companies in the country such as Total and Chevron, part of the venture with Total, to place the revenue in escrow accounts until civilian rule is restored.
Western oil-and-gas companies worry that could be a breach of contract and invite legal reprisals against local employees, according to a person familiar with their thinking. There are no easy options for exiting the country, the person said. Negotiating a sale to exit from the country could take months or years, and quickly handing over fields to an unprepared new operator could lead to power outages, the person said.
Chevron said it is working to ""ensure safe and reliable energy for the people of Myanmar at a time of crisis, and during a pandemic."" Total declined to comment. The company, along with other foreign businesses, signed a mid-February statement saying they were watching developments in Myanmar with ""growing and deep concern.""

The billionaire Warren Buffett added two more big, American brands to Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s investment portfolio.
Mr. Buffett's conglomerate has purchased $8.6 billion in stock in Verizon Communications Inc., the largest U.S. mobile carrier, and $4.1 billion in the oil company Chevron Corp. according to a snapshot of investments held in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
It isn't clear in a filing if Mr. Buffett made the decision to invest in the two firms or if the decision was made by Berkshire money managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler. The two are expected to take over all of Berkshire's investments once Mr. Buffett is no longer in the top job.
In the early months of the pandemic, the 90-year old Mr. Buffett said he was optimistic that the American economy would recover over time from Covid-19 turmoil.
""You can bet on America, but you are going to have to be careful on how you bet,"" Mr. Buffett said in May. ""Simply because markets can do anything.""
The bets on Verizon and Chevron show Berkshire's confidence in the long-term value of these traditional U.S. corporations as well as the telecommunications and fossil fuel industries.
In 2020, Chevron had its worst year since 2016, and Verizon's fourth-quarter profit fell after it booked higher costs and gained fewer new customers than usual.
Berkshire adjusted some of its drugmaker investments bets. The conglomerate sold off its $136 million investment in the Covid-19 vaccine maker Pfizer Inc., while increasing stakes in the pharmaceutical brands AbbVie Inc., Merck & Co. and Bristol Myers Squibb Co.
The conglomerate continued to cut back from financial firms, selling off its remaining $93 million investment in JPMorgan Chase & Co., and whittling away at its stake in Wells Fargo & Co. by $1.4 billion.
Last year Berkshire Hathaway sold stakes in airlines, including United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. Mr. Buffett said that he thought consumer behavior regarding travel had changed for the long term.
Industry observers have been waiting for Mr. Buffett to use a large chunk of Berkshire's more than $150 billion stockpile.
Instead, Berkshire has been spending billions on its own stock, investing $15.7 billion on buybacks alone in the first three quarters of 2020."

The conglomerate continued to cut back from financial firms, selling off its remaining $93 million investment in JPMorgan Chase & Co., and whittling away at its stake in Wells Fargo & Co. by $1.4 billion.
Last year Berkshire Hathaway sold stakes in airlines, including United Airlines Holdings Inc., American Airlines Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. Mr. Buffett said he thought consumer behavior regarding travel had changed for the long term.
Industry observers have been waiting for Mr. Buffett to use a large chunk of Berkshire's more than $150 billion stockpile.
Instead, Berkshire has been spending billions on its own stock, investing $15.7 billion on buybacks alone in the first three quarters of 2020.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has disclosed sizable stakes in Chevron and Verizon Communications at year-end 2020, after previously being allowed to keep those stockholdings undisclosed.
Berkshire (ticker: BRK.B) held 146.7 million shares of Verizon (VZ) worth $8.6 billion at the end of 2020 and 48.5 million shares of Chevron (CVX) worth $4.1 billion, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
The Verizon stake is up sharply from the end of the third quarter, when Berkshire owned 58.4 million Verizon shares worth $3.4 billion. The Chevron stake rose more modestly in the fourth quarter, from 44.3 million at the end of the third quarter. These were disclosed in a 13-F filing for the end of the fourth quarter and an amended 13-F for the end of the third quarter.
The Verizon and Chevron purchases were likely orchestrated by Buffett, the CEO, who oversees the company's huge equity portfolio.
Berkshire requested and received confidentiality from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the Chevron and Verizon stakes at the end of the third quarter, presumably because it was continuing to build positions in those stocks in the fourth quarter and didn't want public disclosure in mid-November to disrupt its accumulation of both stocks.
Berkshire also got confidentiality at the end of the third quarter for a $386 million holding of Marsh & McLennan (MMC) that grew to $499 million at the end of the fourth quarter.
The disclosures settle the mystery of the confidential Berkshire purchases that set off speculation about what stock Buffett was buying. Many investors assumed it was one stock, not two major purchases.
Barron's wrote earlier on Tuesday that the mystery holding likely was a commercial or industrial company based on Berkshire's filings and that Chevron was a possibility.
Chevron was up about 2% in after-hours trading, to $95, on news of the Berkshire holding—the stock finished Tuesday's regular session at $93.13. Verizon was nearly 3% higher after hours, to $55.70, after finishing at $54.15.
Both purchases are in keeping with Buffett's value orientation. Verizon has a low valuation trading for around 10 times estimated 2021 earnings and yields 4.6%. It has trailed the S&P 500 in recent years and is down 7% in the past year while the index is up 16%.
Chevron has rallied off its lows of last spring as oil prices have recovered but is still off 17% in the past year. The company is viewed as the strongest of the global super-major energy companies, with a better balance sheet than rival Exxon Mobil (XOM) and big European rivals like Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A). Chevron's dividend yield is 5.6% and that payout is viewed as increasingly secure with the rise in oil prices.
Berkshire also pared its stake in Apple (AAPL) to 887.2 million shares, according to Tuesday's filing.

Amazon.com Inc.
Jeff Bezos is stepping back from Amazon . The CEO will hand the day-to-day reins to Amazon's cloud-computing guru Andy Jassy and become executive chairman later this year , the company said Tuesday. Mr. Bezos started Amazon.com in 1994 as a scrappy online bookseller, and under his leadership the company became America's largest online retailer and leading cloud-computing service provider, playing big roles in Hollywood, bricks-and-mortar groceries and logistics. Amazon shares fell 2% Wednesday.
Chevron Corp.
Two of Standard Oil's biggest descendants considered a reunion. The leaders of Chevron and Exxon Mobil Corp. discussed merging their companies last year , following the coronavirus outbreak that put them under tremendous financial strain. Such a deal would reshape the oil industry and reunite the two offshoots of John D. Rockefeller's oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911. The talks were preliminary and aren't ongoing, but could come back in the future. But a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. Chevron shares added 1.4% Monday.
Alphabet Inc.
 Global ad spending is on the mend , helping Google's parent company reach new heights. Alphabet posted a record $56.9 billion revenue on Tuesday, with its Google search and YouTube units driving its performance in the quarter. The internet titan's earnings reflected a continuing recovery in advertising spending, which took a hit in early 2020 when people paused travel plans and other purchases in response to the pandemic. YouTube revenue soared 46% in the quarter, as advertisers flocked to the video-sharing platform amid the pandemic. The company said the platform now reaches more users between the ages of 25 and 49 than all cable networks combined. Alphabet shares rose 7.4% Wednesday.
Merck & Co.
Mr. Bezos isn't the only chief executive who announced he was relinquishing the title. Merck's Kenneth Frazier will retire as CEO at the end of June and will be succeeded by Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis, the drugmaker said Thursday. Under Mr. Frazier's leadership, Merck became a leader in cancer immunotherapy and in the development of the drug Keytruda, now one of its top sellers. Mr. Frazier was a leading industry voice in recent years encouraging companies to hire more Black employees. Just four of the chief executives of S&P 500 companies—or 1%—are Black, including Mr. Frazier. He has also steered Merck through criticism from politicians and patients about how the industry prices its medications. Merck shares lost 1.7% Thursday.
Peloton Interactive Inc.
Peloton is backpedaling on the launch of its new treadmill, due to its shipping woes. The at-home exercise company said on Thursday that it would delay the much-anticipated product release and start shipping its equipment by air in an effort to ease extreme delivery delays. Peloton's logistics problems stem from surging demand for its pricey stationary bikes—especially during Covid-19—as well as shipping logjams and weather disruptions. To address monthslong wait times and delivery cancellations that prompted social-media backlash, the company cut back marketing and doubled the size of its customer-service operation. It said it expects delivery times to return to normal by the end of June. Peloton shares fell 5.9% Friday.
Ford Motor Co.
Auto makers are slashing production thanks to a global semiconductor shortfall. Ford said Thursday it plans to cut production of its F-150 pickup truck—the nation's top-selling vehicle and the company's biggest moneymaker—because of the shortage. Car makers use semiconductors in everything from engine-control units and transmissions to the large tabletlike displays embedded in the dashboard. Chip manufacturers are working to rebound from shutdowns last spring, while demand rises with increased use of technology during the pandemic. Ford executives warned that losses of vehicle production globally in the first two quarters could trim $1 billion to $2.5 billion from its pretax bottom line this year. Ford shares added 1.2% Friday.
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE ADR
It's time for Tiffany & Co. workers to go back to the office. A month after acquiring the U.S. jeweler, the French luxury giant LVMH told its New York City employees to return to the office two days a week beginning March 1, as LVMH starts to integrate the company. Tiffany will join a small list of large New York companies that have required employees to return to the office during the pandemic, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. LVMH's acquisition of Tiffany closed on Jan. 7, after a tumultuous few months in which it tried to back out of the deal. American depositary shares of LVMH added 1.6% Friday.

| Jump to first hitWall Street analysts on Monday gave little credence to the possibility of an Exxon-Chevron mega merger, as news of talks last year between the two largest U.S. oil companies leaked ahead of Exxon's results that are expected to show the company posting its first-ever annual loss.
Shares in Exxon were down slightly in afternoon trading in New York, while Chevron was up 1.1 per cent, despite a rising overall market and weekend gains in global crude prices.
""At the depths of the market last year ... a cost-cutting-focused merger of the two companies may have made sense and also scale matters in this industry so it would have created by far the largest integrated oil company,"" said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.
However, anti-trust concerns and the new U.S. administration's stance on big mergers make it unlikely that a deal resurfaces, Kapadia said, adding that buying smaller, hard-hit oil companies gives Exxon and Chevron more value.
As oil producers in Europe adapt to investors'push for a shift into renewables, it is also possible that Chevron or Exxon could buy the oil-producing business of a European major in the coming years, Kapadia said.
Exxon's year-end results scheduled for Tuesday are expected to be marred by a charge of up to US$20 billion on the value of its natural gas properties.
The collapse in oil prices last April briefly pushed crude into negative territory and created a survival crisis for large parts of the U.S. industry.
""Given the precipitous drop (last year)... it is not surprising that XOM and CVX had a discussion about merging,"" said Mark Stoeckle, CEO of Baltimore-based Adams Funds.
""The sharp snapback in prices likely cooled both companies. There would no doubt be significant cost synergies to be had, but the antitrust issues in a Biden administration would probably be too much to overcome.""
The chief executives of Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. spoke last year about combining the two largest U.S. oil companies.
Dow Jones reported on the weekend that Chevron's Mike Wirth and Exxon's Darren Woods spoke as the COVID-19 outbreak hurt oil and gas demand, adding financial strain to both companies. The talks were described as preliminary and aren't ongoing, the news services said, citing people familiar with the talks, adding that the discussions could be brought back in the future.
Combining the firms would create a giant with a market capitalization of more than US$350 billion at current valuations, and with more revenue than Saudi Aramco."

The big international oil companies are reporting one of their worst annual performances in decades and signaling that the pandemic could continue to challenge their businesses in 2021.
Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC on Tuesday disclosed annual losses of $22 billion and $18.1 billion respectively, following Chevron Corp., which on Friday reported a $5.5 billion loss for 2020.
Exxon posted its fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history, driven by a more than $19 billion write-down. Excluding the impairment, Exxon turned a quarterly profit of $110 million.
BP reported a replacement cost profit—a metric similar to the net income figure that U.S. oil companies report—of $825 million for the three months ended Dec. 31, from a loss of $4 million in the year-earlier period.
Covid-19 has sapped demand for oil, hitting prices and prompting the world's biggest energy companies to slash spending, cut jobs and write down the value of their assets. Amid the crisis, Exxon and Chevron discussed a merger of the U.S. oil giants last year, according to people familiar with the matter, although the talks didn't progress.
""The past year presented the most challenging market conditions Exxon Mobil has ever experienced,"" said Chief Executive Darren W. Woods.
Exxon remains under pressure from a pair of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, nominated four directors to Exxon's board last week and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan. On Tuesday, Exxon announced it had elected a new independent director to its board and is continuing discussions with other director candidates.
Engine No. 1 said the changes were insufficient.
""A board that has underperformed this dramatically and defied shareholder sentiment for this long has not earned the right to choose its own new members or pack itself in the face of calls for change,"" Engine No. 1 said in a statement. ""Exxon Mobil shareholders deserve a board that works proactively to create long-term value, not defensively in the face of deteriorating returns and the threat of losing their seats.""
The Pandemic's Effect on the Oil Industry
BP said Tuesday that Covid-19 restrictions would continue to sap demand early in 2021 and that the pandemic might have an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.
Still, Chief Executive Bernard Looney said the company expects demand to stabilize this year, although the speed and degree of the recovery is uncertain.
""It's all dependent on vaccine rollouts, vaccine efficacy and OPEC compliance,"" Mr. Looney said. Unlike its U.S. counterparts, BP hadn't spoken to any of its peers about mergers, Mr. Looney said, adding that the company was focused on executing its strategy to pivot toward low-carbon energy.
BP's shares traded 3.1% lower in London on Tuesday as the results came in below analysts' expectations. Exxon was slightly up premarket Tuesday following its results.
Other oil companies are also feeling the strain. Royal Dutch Shell PLC reports Thursday and has telegraphed it will take a large write-down.
The pandemic has already triggered the largest revision of the value of oil-and-gas assets in at least a decade, as companies sour on costly projects amid the prospect of low prices for years. Exxon's more than $19 billion write-down, primarily related to U.S. shale gas assets, is among the largest ever taken in the industry.
The Irving, Texas-based company cut nearly $12 billion from its 2020 capital expenditures and $8 billion from operating expenses in response to the pandemic and said Tuesday that it would trim operational spending by another $3 billion by 2023.
Exxon plans to spend as much $25 billion a year on capital expenditures through 2025, but said Tuesday that if Brent crude oil prices fall below $45 a barrel it could cut spending further. The company said it expects to cover its dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, from its cash flow in 2021, assuming Brent is $50 a barrel. It was trading around $56 Tuesday.
Activist investor Engine No.1 has argued Exxon should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. However, Exxon and rival Chevron haven't set out plans to invest substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.
On Monday, Exxon said it would form a business unit focusing exclusively on technologies to reduce carbon emissions , investing about $3 billion through 2025, primarily on carbon-capture projects, which gather carbon emissions from industrial processes, or directly from the air, and deposit them underground.
BP has suggested that demand for fossil fuels might never fully recover and that the pandemic could accelerate the pace of transition to a lower-carbon economy. Under Mr. Looney, BP has embarked on a plan to reduce its dependence on oil and gas, while increasing investments in low-carbon energy like wind and solar power.
French energy giant Total SE has also outlined plans to build up its renewables business, while Shell has signaled its intention to set out a similar path later this month.
""An unprecedented demand collapse has forced the hand of Big Oil to right-size their dividends and capital frames; meanwhile plans for energy transition have been accelerated,"" said Christyan Malek, an analyst at JPMorgan.
To bolster its finances, BP has been selling assets to reduce debt. The company said it was now more than halfway to its target of $25 billion of asset sales by 2025, helped Monday by the sale of a 20% stake in a gas development in Oman. BP aims to lower its debt to $35 billion by the first quarter of next year, down from $39 billion at the end of 2020.
Rebecca Fitz, a senior director at Boston Consulting Group, said she thinks both the European and American strategies can work, but both must deliver better returns and produce less carbon to be palatable to investors.
""When you have less capital, choices around how you allocate that capital are more stark,"" Ms. Fitz said.

The chief executives of Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. spoke about combining the oil giants after the pandemic shook the world last year, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods discussed a merger following the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which decimated oil and gas demand and put enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren't ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.
Such a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and would reshape the energy industry.
A combined company's market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron's is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world's second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about seven million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.
But a merger of the two largest U.S. oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said he would push the country to ""transition away from the oil industry."" He hasn't been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department's head of that division.
One of the people familiar with the talks said the sides might have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, a Republican whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.
A handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron's $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips' roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.
Such a deal would significantly surpass in size the megamergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.
It also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction now belongs to the $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch PLC in 2000, according to Dealogic.
Many investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.
In an interview discussing Chevron's earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company's board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.
""As for larger scale things, it's happened before,"" Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s mergers. ""Time will tell.""
Paul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated then that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.
Exxon was the U.S.'s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron's. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.
Its market capitalization is now about one-quarter that of electric-car maker Tesla Inc., which has a market value of about $752 billion.
Exxon's shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron's are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.
Exxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.
Chevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses on Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet -- in part because it walked away from its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.
Exxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Some investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon's direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry. Some are also worried that Exxon might have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.
Mr. Woods embarked on a plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending."

Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.
Rivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven't rewarded.
Exxon and Chevron haven't invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.

| Jump to first hitHOUSTON U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. on Friday swung to a surprise US$11-million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.
Oil companies are expected to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices after a one-two punch of falling demand and prices put the industry in a tailspin last year. But as Chevron's final quarter of 2020 showed, pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to hammer fuel demand.
""We expect only a gradual recovery in the global economy,"" said Chevron CEO Michael Wirth in a call with analysts. Its oil production this year will be flat to slightly higher on lower spending. Refining operations that generated losses in the fourth quarter should improve, he said.
The firm reported a US$5.54-billion full-year loss, its first since 2016, compared with earnings of US$2.92 billion in 2019.

| Jump to first hitHOUSTON U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. on Friday swung to a surprise US$11-million fourth-quarter loss as low margins on fuel, acquisition costs and foreign currency effects overwhelmed improved drilling results.
Oil companies are expected to benefit from a rebound in oil and gas prices after a one-two punch of falling demand and prices put the industry in a tailspin last year. But as Chevron's final quarter of 2020 showed, pandemic-related travel restrictions continue to hammer fuel demand.

Chevron Corp. posted its third consecutive quarterly loss Friday to close its worst year since 2016, as the global pandemic continues to weigh on the oil-and-gas industry and cloud hopes for renewed economic growth in 2021.
Chevron is looking to turn the corner on one of the most painful years in modern history for oil-and-gas companies. The coronavirus sapped global demand for fossil fuels as the industry also faces longer-term challenges from the rise of electric cars, the proliferation of renewable energy and growing concern about the lasting impact of climate change.
The San Ramon, Calif.-based company is among the first of the energy giants to report their year-end results. For the fourth quarter, Chevron posted a loss of $665 million. For all of 2020, the loss totaled $5.5 billion; Chevron reported nearly $3 billion in profit for 2019.
""We've demonstrated that we can survive a year unlike any other and come through it even stronger,"" Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview. ""Now we've got to come through this pandemic and see what the real state of the global economy is, and I think it's going to be uneven.""
Chevron's oil-and-gas-production unit posted $501 million in profit for the fourth quarter, but results were weighed down by the refining and chemical businesses, as well as higher pension expenses and costs related to the $5 billion acquisition of Noble Energy last year. Analysts had expected Chevron to post a quarterly profit, and the company's share price fell more than 4% Friday.
Chevron's share price has fallen about 23% over the past year, a steep decline but better than many of its peers. Investors have expressed more faith in Chevron than rival Exxon Mobil Corp. because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet. Exxon had about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron had around $35 billion, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Exxon is expected to report its quarterly results on Tuesday.
Chevron's stock has been buoyed recently by oil prices climbing about 5% over the past month, as Brent crude, the global benchmark, rose more than 8% over the same period.
Oil traders have been shrugging off expanding coronavirus-related lockdowns in Asia and Europe, anticipating increased oil and gas demand in 2021 as vaccines are distributed, according to analyst Rystad Energy. Oil prices have also been boosted by Saudi Arabia's pledge to cut another one million barrels a day of oil production in February and March.
Some analysts believe Chevron is poised for a much stronger year. The company could generate about $12 billion in free cash flow in 2021 if Brent oil prices are around $50 a barrel, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., more than enough to cover its roughly $10 billion in annual dividend payments.
Chevron can now break even if oil is at $46 a barrel, said JPMorgan, after it made steep spending cuts and reduced its workforce in 2020. Last year, Chevron lowered its 2020 capital expenditures to $14 billion from $20 billion, and said it would spend between $14 billion and $16 billion annually through 2025. It had previously said it could spend as much $22 billion a year over that period.
The $665 million fourth-quarter loss compared with a loss of $6.6 billion during the 2019 period, which was driven by a roughly $10 billion write-down. Revenue fell to $25 billion in the 2020 quarter from about $36 billion.
Chevron leaned on its strong balance sheet to complete one of the largest oil-and-gas deals in 2020, its acquisition of Noble Energy, which was completed in October.
The company's oil and gas production increased 1% in 2020 from the previous year to 3.08 million barrels a day, in part because Chevron added Noble's output. Morgan Stanley estimates Chevron will produce nearly 3.3 million barrels a day in 2021.
Despite some optimism for an industry rebound in the coming year, long-term questions hover over oil-and-gas companies' future profitability. This week, S&P Global Ratings warned it could cut the credit rating of Chevron and many other major oil companies over growing risks to the industry from a transition to a lower-carbon economy spurred by concerns about climate change. Such a credit downgrade could increase borrowing costs for the sector, making it more difficult to finance large projects.
On Wednesday, President Biden issued an executive order temporarily suspending new oil and gas leases on federal land, which analysts said signaled a more restrictive U.S. policy outlook for the industry. About 25% of U.S. oil production is tied to federal lands and waters, according to Morgan Stanley, and Chevron has a large presence in both.
Mr. Wirth said the world is moving to a lower-carbon energy system and that Chevron's strategy is to simultaneously lower its carbon footprint and generate higher returns. He said he supports President Biden's desire to reduce carbon emissions, but said some of the executive orders were broad and risked erecting barriers to responsible energy development."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
In a sector facing uncomfortable questions about the future, it helps to stay out of the spotlight. Chevron certainly managed to do that as its competitor Exxon Mobil faces scrutiny from activist investors and securities regulators.
Chevron took large write-downs early on in the pandemic, in line with European peers, potentially helping it stay out of asset valuation questions Exxon is facing. And while activist investors are pressuring Exxon to work on both environmental and growth sustainability, Chevron noted on Friday's earnings call that it hasn't faced similar pressures, noting that its investors prefer energy-transition investments that don't erode returns.
Still, Chevron's fourth-quarter results showed how far both U.S. energy giants are from recovery. For the full year, Chevron recorded a net loss of $5.5 billion, by far its worst performance in three decades and only the second time during that span that it posted an annual loss. For the quarter, the company's revenue met Wall Street expectations, but one-off items spurred a surprise loss of $665 million.
There were still things to like. Chevron has been differentiating itself from Exxon through a more conservative strategy, keeping a lid on capital expenditures well before the pandemic hit. Operating cash flow, for example, was higher than analyst expectations, and its net debt ratio was 23%, even after having taken on borrowings associated with its acquisition of Noble Energy last year -- well within its target range.
Strong fundamentals might be why Chevron has dodged the scrutiny that Exxon is facing. Both have stuck to promises to grow dividends; the difference is that Chevron can sustain it more easily. Dividends are eroding Chevron's cash position at a much slower rate: For the full year, free cash flow minus dividends was negative $8 billion; Exxon burned through more in just the second quarter of 2020.
Chevron is catching up to Exxon in production too, narrowing the gap after it acquired Noble Energy. It produced 3.3 million oil-equivalent barrels a day of hydrocarbons last quarter, just a few hundred thousand barrels off from Exxon.
The sector as a whole is facing a lot of external pressure lately. This week alone, S&P Global Ratings placed major oil-and-gas companies on a credit watch and the Biden administration ordered a freeze on federal oil-and-gas leasing. Exxon's shadow at least offers relative safety."

Oil and gas prices are rebounding from their pandemic lows, but the road ahead for the industry remains challenging amid new competitive threats and demands from investors.
Global spending on oil and gas production is poised to remain below pre-pandemic levels through at least 2025, according to consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, as companies face pressure to improve returns and reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. Meanwhile, investment in renewables and other clean energy technologies is taking off, threatening to eat into the market for oil and gas long-term.
Though oil prices have notched gains since November, they're expected to remain below levels that support attractive returns, particularly for an industry still recuperating from last year's historic drop in fuel demand.
As a result, companies aren't rushing back into drilling. A third of oil producers surveyed by the Dallas branch of the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter said they planned to raise capital expenditures only slightly this year. About half said they would either keep spending flat reduce investments.
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. cut plans to invest a combined $260 billion through 2025 to as low as $177 billion.
Over the next five years, global oil spending is projected to come to a little more than half of what companies invested in the first half of the 2010s, according to Wood Mackenzie. Last year, the pandemic had brought oil investments to the lowest levels since 2005.
The slowdown comes as investors explore alternatives such as solar and wind power, which have seen costs drop dramatically in recent years, and emerging technologies such as battery storage and biofuels.
Energy investment outside of fossil fuels, including renewables and other clean-energy technologies, is set to attract 60% of the world's energy investment in this decade, according to the International Energy Agency.
Non-fossil-fuel investments will climb to an annual average of $1.4 trillion, the IEA says, higher than the $935 billion it has projected for oil, natural gas and coal. In the 2030s, it says, those investments will make up roughly two-thirds of energy spending.
The projected shift in investments means that, after decades dominated by fossil fuels, renewables are poised to gain ground.
By 2030, noncarbon energy is expected to climb to almost 13% of the world's energy demand from 9.8% in 2019, according to IHS Markit. Last year will be the first in which clean energy surpassed 10% of demand, the consulting firm projected, in data going back to 1990.
Whether this spending shift affects consumers in the next few years is uncertain, but some believe oil companies will eventually have to increase spending to meet global demand in coming decades.
The International Energy Forum, a group advising energy importing and exporting countries, says the oil industry's capital expenditures need to climb by $225 billion from last year's levels by 2030 to prevent a fuel-price spike that would be damaging to economic growth. It warned that ""peak investment,"" in which oil spending stays lower than 2019 levels for good, was a more pressing post-virus issue than peak oil demand.
Meanwhile, the consulting firm Rystad Energy said in a recent analysis that it would take 80 years to find sufficient supplies to meet global demand through 2050 at the past decade's low level of exploration activity.
For now, though, American drivers aren't giving oil companies much reason to change course. Household spending on gasoline in the U.S. is projected to edge upward this year but remain well below 2017-19 levels, according to fuel-price tracking site GasBuddy.
Another reason oil companies will keep spending at lower levels is that electric vehicles are expected to skyrocket to about 32% of new vehicle sales globally in 2030, up from less than 4% last year, according to Deloitte, which made the forecast before a recent uptick in auto sales. In China, they will rise to 48%, and in the U.S. to 27%, Deloitte projects.

3047045957,27-Apr-24,"Exxon, Chevron Report Earnings Decline --- Oil giants cite falling natural-gas prices, narrowing margins for making fuel",https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/exxon-chevron-report-earnings-decline-oil-giants/docview/3047045957/se-2?accountid=7064,CVX,"Exxon Mobil and Chevron posted lower first-quarter profits in part due to anemic natural-gas prices and refining margins, as their run of record-setting results tapers off.
The oil-and-gas companies combined to bank $13.7 billion, maintaining their perch among the most profitable companies in the U.S. But the quarterly results were fairly humdrum by their recent standards.
On Friday, Exxon reported first-quarter earnings of $8.2 billion, down about 28% compared with the same period a year ago, as oil-refining margins and natural-gas prices fell from postpandemic peaks. Exxon missed Wall Street estimates by about 6%, according to FactSet. The weaker results were still its second-strongest first-quarter haul in the past decade.
Chevron said it made $5.5 billion in the quarter, down about 16% from a year earlier but beating analysts' estimates by about 2%.
For the past two years, Exxon Mobil and Chevron enjoyed a period of profitability unprecedented in their long histories as they rode surging energy prices to record profits and shareholder payouts. The two companies, who are also locked in a dispute over a massive discovery in Guyana, are adjusting to a new normal.
Oil-and-gas supplies have largely stabilized since the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and some investors and analysts say companies such as Exxon -- the western world's largest oil refiner -- will have to prove it can keep costs down and production up if the benefits of external market forces continue to ebb.
Exxon and Chevron attributed much of their declines in earnings to falling natural-gas prices and narrowing margins for making fuel. Exxon offset some of the decline as oil production rose faster than anticipated from its Guyana venture and its refineries put out a record amount of fuel for any first quarter. Its oil operations brought in $1 billion in cash over analysts' expectations. Balance-sheet adjustments contributed significantly to the earnings miss, it said.
""We're making great progress on our plans to grow the earnings power of our existing businesses,"" Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said.
Chevron, meanwhile, said it increased global production 12% compared with the same period last year, following its purchase of PDC Energy and an operational boost in U.S. shale and Kazakhstan.
Oil prices have climbed about 17% this year, pushing Exxon's share price to a record high in April. It surpassed Tesla's market value earlier this month. Exxon shares fell about 3% Friday, while Chevron's shares were largely flat.
Exxon continues to give priority to investor payouts as it sent more cash to shareholders than it spent on new projects in the quarter. It slashed capital spending 8.5% from the prior-year period while raising dividends and share repurchases collectively to $6.8 billion.
Oil stocks are something of a conundrum for investors. Exxon shares are up about 15% on the year and Chevron about 11%. Their stocks are benefiting from investors looking for a hedge from persistent inflation, and energy companies have outperformed almost every other sector in the S&P 500.
Yet investors remain wary of piling into big oil stocks. The energy sector is still only a small part of the S&P 500, with its weighting currently around 4% of the index. Investors and analysts said they have only seen a modest uptick in Wall Street interest in the sector, and many are watching for an anticipated end to the American shale boom.
With expectations that U.S. oil-production growth will be modest this year -- and potentially peaking in the next few -- some investors are betting oil prices will eventually go up. Brent, the global oil benchmark, rose above $90 a barrel this month, but edged lower this past week.
The higher-than-expected inflation has helped to boost energy company stocks. Still, many on Wall Street are too fearful of a decline in fossil fuels' role in future energy consumption to park a substantially larger amount of cash in U.S. oil companies, among other uncertainties.
""There's still a lingering concern for this sector, that it's a sunset industry because of the energy transition,"" said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The uncertainty about the future, he said, to some extent paralyzes much of the industry.
""The easiest thing to do is to keep buying back your shares, where you get rewarded in the short term, and then that allows you to grow your dividend as well,"" Borkhataria said.
Guyana, where Exxon made one of the largest modern oil discoveries, remains a bright spot for the company.
Exxon Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells said Exxon produced more than 600,000 barrels a day in the South American country after bringing its latest oil-production project there up to speed in two months, faster than the industry's standard, 15 months.
Exxon is now locked in a continuing dispute with Chevron over rights to Hess's stake in Guyana, where Exxon leads the consortium developing offshore oil deposits. Chevron agreed to purchase Hess for $53 billion in stock last year, including Hess's 30% stake in the Guyana project.
Exxon has challenged the deal, filing for arbitration over whether it has a right to pre-empt Chevron's offer for Hess's interest in the Guyana project, which analysts say makes up the majority of Hess's market value. The CEOs of both companies were expected to face questions about the status of the dispute on calls with investors on Friday.
Mikells said Exxon and Hess have both selected arbitrators, with a third yet to be appointed. ""We're at the early part of this process,"" she said, noting an arbitration panel will determine the timeline.
Some investors are worried that the Guyana dispute could scuttle Chevron's megadeal and are frustrated that the company missed production growth targets last year.
Chevron's recent results in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico have reassured investors about its inventory of wells and how effective it is at operating them. Chevron's oil-and-gas production in the U.S. rose 35% compared with a year ago, the company said.
This past week, Chevron said it started up a major project upgrading its Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan, also helping ease concerns after the company had to contend with delays and cost overruns there."

The Biden administration said Wednesday it would allow some American and European oil companies to carry on in Venezuela after the U.S.'s efforts to coax President Nicolas Maduro into democratic reforms by lifting economic sanctions ended in a hardening of his authoritarian regime.
After Maduro violated an October agreement with the U.S. to stage free and fair elections, the White House was under pressure to reimpose sanctions on Venezuela's lifeblood energy industry.
Under the new guidelines released Wednesday, a number of Western energy firms that entered Venezuela after the U.S. lifted sanctions and issued a six-month general license permitting oil operations are required to apply for individual licenses from the Treasury Department to remain in the country. Without that license, they must close up operations by May 31.
Chevron, Italy's Eni, Repsol of Spain and other companies that in 2022 received special licenses to operate in Venezuela don't need new ones and can carry on with operations in ventures with the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela. Companies that want to get into Venezuela can do so after applying for a license.
The Biden administration has faced challenges in holding Maduro accountable for his anti-democratic actions in ways that wouldn't disrupt regional energy markets and raise gasoline prices in the U.S. U.S. officials also worried about taking actions that would nudge Venezuela closer to U.S. adversaries such as Russia, Iran and China, Caracas-based oil consultant Antero Alvarado said.
The new policy of requiring companies to seek individual licenses is likely to benefit large oil majors with lobbying power in Washington. It will also benefit shipping companies that had helped Venezuela move crude on the black market and whose services may be needed, said Alvarado. Venezuela is producing about 800,000 barrels a day.
""The U.S. had to show they were doing something,"" Alvarado said of the policy. ""But in the end, things don't change all that much, it just adds a lot more bureaucracy.""
U.S. officials declined to say how many or identify the companies that would be required to apply for licenses. And it remained unclear the impact the new policy would have on oil production in Venezuela, which pumps far less than its leading competitors in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico.
Individual licenses will be granted in accordance with U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, officials said. They explained that Maduro still has time to reverse anti-democratic practices and hold fair elections on July 28.
Since signing the election deal in Barbados in October with the U.S.-backed opposition, Maduro has banned his top rival, Maria Corina Machado, from running against him, as well as her chosen stand-in. He has also arrested scores of dissident activists and blocked the vast majority of the 8 million migrants who have fled Venezuela under his 11-year rule from registering to vote in the coming election.

Chevron has completed its exit from Myanmar, giving up its stake in the country's largest natural gas project two years after saying it would depart the troubled Southeast Asian nation in the wake of a military coup.
A spokesperson for the U.S. energy giant confirmed Tuesday that two of its units had formally withdrawn Chevron's stakes in the offshore Yadana natural gas project and an associated pipeline company.
Chevron redistributed its 41% stake in Yadana to Thailand's state-owned energy group PTT Exploration & Production and Myanmar's state-owned Myanma Oil and Gas Enterprise, the project's two remaining shareholders.
""The withdrawal gives effect to our intention to exit Myanmar in a controlled and orderly manner, following the February 2021 coup, and ongoing humanitarian crisis,"" the Chevron spokesperson said.
Chevron in 2022 announced its plan to exit Myanmar, later agreeing to sell its assets in the country to Canadian oil firm MTI Energy.
It declined to comment Tuesday on why it had chosen to redistribute the stake instead, but said it had carried out its exit ""in a responsible, orderly and safe manner, in accordance with international law and trade sanctions.""
Chevron won't book a financial gain from the redistribution, the spokesperson confirmed. PTTEP said separately in a filing to the Thai stock exchange that Chevron's withdrawal was effective April 1, and that the Thai company's stake in Yadana had risen to almost 63%. PTTEP has been the project's operator since 2022, when French oil-and-gas group TotalEnergies withdrew both as partner and operator as part of its own exit from Myanmar.
Yadana is Myanmar's largest natural-gas project, and one of the biggest in Southeast Asia. It produced about half of all gas consumed in Myanmar in 2021, according to PTTEP.
Chevron's withdrawal marks the end of a decadeslong foray into Myanmar, a country of about 55 million people whose political conflicts have frustrated attempts to shake off its relative isolation and draw more foreign investment to catch up to more developed neighbors."

Is the massive Chevron-Hess oil deal slip-sliding away?
Hedge funds that specialize in merger arbitrage are steering clear of a tie-up set to close by the end of June. That created a potential ""heads I win, tails I don't lose very much"" situation for people brave enough to invest in shares of the target. Chevron said in October that it would pay $53 billion in stock for Hess. The deal valued Hess at $171 a share at the time and had been approved beforehand by both companies' boards. Unfortunately, a rival could play spoiler.
Exxon Mobil had just set the largest oil-and-gas deal in decades weeks earlier by agreeing to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. Chevron had its deal for Anadarko snatched away years earlier by Occidental and may have been willing to take a risk.
The gamble it took is that Exxon operates and owns 45% of the largest oil discovery in years, the Stabroek block in the waters off Guyana. Hess's 30% stake is its most-valuable asset. Now Exxon says the terms of the agreement it originally signed with Shell, which sold its stake to Hess, allow it a right of first refusal for the stake. Chevron disagrees that the deal triggers that right. Spokesman Braden Reddall wrote in an email Thursday that Chevron is ""fully committed to the transaction"" and that the company is confident it will close.
The stock market isn't. At the deal's original value there is a 19% gap between Hess's share price, plus two more dividend payments Hess shareholders could receive by the end of June, and the offer. That is 74%, annualized, if it closes on time. At Chevron's current, lower, share price, that annualized gain would be 25%. The actual return might be somewhere in between, since Chevron's shares might have suffered a bit due to the uncertainty.
The odds of the deal closing, or the costs to merger arbitragers if it is delayed by a contract arbitration claim Exxon filed Wednesday, aren't the only things to consider for Hess shareholders. Chevron says that a failure of the deal would trigger a $1.715 billion termination payment to it from Hess. Reddall said in a later email that the agreement with Hess ""does not provide for any break fees relating to the ROFR."" A Hess spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.
The deal's closing date could be extended to October 2025 to allow for arbitration, according to Chevron's filings.
Clearly there were doubts from the outset. Hess shares dropped the day the deal was announced and are now 11% lower, which is twice the drop of a basket of oil-and-gas exploration companies. That fully accounts for the value of the termination fee. It might be worth owning Hess shares since the worst-case scenario appears priced in.
Or maybe it isn't: The nightmare scenario would be a Venezuelan takeover of parts of Guyana. Its neighbor, with a large, Russian- and Iranian-supplied military, moved troops to their common border last month and would easily overwhelm the former British colony's small defense force. Venezuela says it conducted a referendum last year that approved annexation. Try hedging that."

Exxon Mobil has filed for arbitration to protect what it says is its right to pre-empt Chevron's bid for a stake in a prolific oil project off Guyana, escalating a dispute that could torpedo Chevron's $53 billion deal for Hess.
Chevron last week warned investors that Exxon and China's Cnooc say they have the right to counter Chevron's offer for Hess's stake in the Guyana project, which Exxon operates and is one of the largest oil finds in years. Chevron said arbitration could be pursued in the event that talks between the companies fell apart.
Exxon senior vice president Neil Chapman said Wednesday that Exxon had filed that day for arbitration in the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.
He said Exxon had taken tremendous exploration, financial and commercial risks developing the South American oil project, and that it had a responsibility to shareholders to ensure it realizes the value that it had created in Guyana.
""It would be incomprehensible for us to say, 'Well, we're not going to look at that value. We're just going to let the transaction proceed,'"" he said during a chat at Morgan Stanley's Energy & Power Conference in New York, according to a transcript of his comments.
Much of the value in Chevron's $53 billion all-stock acquisition of Hess proposed last year was tied to the smaller New York oil company's 30% stake in the drilling consortium in Guyanese waters. The partnership has expanded oil production far faster than most offshore oil projects and expects to pump over a million barrels a day in coming years.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall has said Chevron and Hess don't believe a right of first refusal applies to the Hess deal. He said in a statement Wednesday that Chevron remains fully committed to the transaction and is confident in its position.
A Hess spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Cnooc didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The dispute boils down to the terms of a joint operating agreement, or JOA, signed more than a decade ago, which governs the consortium. Hess had entered the JOA in 2014 when it purchased its stake from Shell. Some JOAs allow existing partners, like Exxon, to participate in ownership changes, and pre-empt an offer for an ownership stake with an offer of their own.
""We are confident in our reading of the contract we, with our initial partners, helped write and that Hess agreed to when they entered the JOA,"" an Exxon spokeswoman said Wednesday.
Exxon has a 45% share in the Guyana oil project and Cnooc owns the remaining 25%."

| Jump to first hitIt's rare for disputes between any of the world's supermajor oil companies to spill out in public. It's even rarer that one could end up costing US$53 billion.
But the oil riches beneath Guyana's coastal waters are so valuable Exxon Mobil Corp. is willing to battle over the legal intricacies of a contract signed a decade ago to keep the prize mostly to itself and away from Chevron Corp.
The stakes in the fight - which has the potential to scuttle Chevron's takeover of Hess Corp. - couldn't be much higher.
Exxon this week said it's considering exercising rights to acquire the Hess stake in a giant offshore oil development in Guyana, the key asset that lured Chevron into the Hess acquisition.
A win for Exxon, which made the Guyana discovery in 2015 and owns 45 per cent of the project, would enhance the stock-market premium it derives from being the sole Western supermajor with a share in the world's fastest-growing major oil development.
Victory for Chevron would mean it gains Hess's 30 per cent stake in Exxon's marquee project, narrows the valuation gap with its larger rival and provides low-cost production growth for years.
""This is such a material issue to Hess and its value,"" said Afra Afsharipour, a law professor at the University of California. ""It would not be unusual if somebody like Exxon did that to a competitor, to try to poke holes into a competitor's deal.""
The Guyana project is unique for its size, rapid growth and high profitability. It's a particularly rare combination now because, Exxon aside, most oil majors have shied away from megaprojects due to concerns about the environment, peak oil demand and investors'preference for buybacks and dividends over production growth.
Stabroek holds 11 billion barrels, and Exxon's speedy development plan means production will double to 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, putting Guyana on par with Angola, a member of OPEC.
Extracting Guyana's oil is profitable at prices less than US$35 a barrel, nearly US$50 below Brent's current level, in part because of a favourable production-sharing contract first signed with the government in 1999, when the basin was considered high-risk.
It's no surprise then that Exxon wants to preserve the value of what an executive once described as its ""fairy tale"" oil discovery.
At issue is a private contract between Exxon, Hess and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC) governing Guyana's Stabroek block. It contains a ""right of first refusal"" clause, meaning that if one party wants to sell its stake, it must first offer it to the other two.
Chevron in a regulatory filing this week said the clause doesn't apply because it is buying Hess in its entirety, not just the Guyana asset. Exxon said in a statement that it disagrees and has a duty to its shareholders to enforce its pre-emption rights within the contract ""to realize the significant value we've created.""
""It appears that Exxon/CNOOC can potentially block Chevron from acquiring Hess Guyana, but not necessarily acquire it themselves,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Biraj Borkhataria said in a note. ""This is what is likely up for debate.""
The prospect of Exxon buying Hess's stake appears remote. If the dispute goes to arbitration and Chevron wins, the deal can close as originally intended. If Exxon wins, Chevron would cancel the takeover and Hess would remain independent.
""There's no possible scenario in which Exxon or CNOOC could acquire Hess's interest in Guyana as a result of the Chevron-Hess transaction,"" Chevron said in a statement.
Chevron also said it's ""fully committed"" to the deal and doesn't believe the contract or discussions with Exxon will prevent its completion.
Exxon may be taking the stance, ""'We don't care, you're not going to get this, we're just going to exercise our rights,'"" said Haag Sherman, chief executive of Tectonic Financial Inc., which manages US$6.7 billion in assets. ""If I'm Exxon, I'm doing the same thing.""
All parties remain in discussions, according to Chevron's filing. That suggests the dispute may yet end amicably in a negotiated settlement before it gets to arbitration.
""It could ruin the deal, although the chances are low,"" said Kevin MacCurdy, director of research at Pickering Energy Partners. ""I'd be surprised if this deal ultimately didn't go through.""

Oil-and-gas companies are accelerating investments in geothermal energy, betting the technologies that fueled the shale revolution can turn the budding industry into a large producer of clean power.
Chevron, BP and Devon Energy are part of a group of fossil-fuel companies investing hundreds of millions of dollars in modern geothermal startups and projects. Many of these companies are using the same technology employed by frackers, but instead of searching for oil and gas, they are looking for underground heat.
The new geothermal industry is the result of a surprising confluence of interests among the oil-and-gas, technology and green-power industries. The heat that the drillers find underground can be used to generate a steady, round-the-clock supply of carbon-free electricity, which is coveted by tech companies for their power-hungry data centers.
Finding pockets of underground heat is relatively easy in places with lots of geothermal activity, including parts of the U.S., Indonesia and New Zealand. When the heat is deeper in the earth, it is more difficult and more expensive to find. Those constraints have kept the sector's share of U.S. electricity generation at less than 1%.
Technological advances in well drilling, modeling and sensor technology are expected to change that: The Energy Department estimates geothermal energy could power the equivalent of more than 65 million U.S. homes by 2050.
New funding for a startup called Fervo Energy follows drilling results showing declining costs in the sector.
The industry began changing about five years ago, when companies like Google launched efforts to run their operations on renewable power 24/7 and found that wind and solar, which can't supply uninterrupted power, couldn't get there on their own.
""It created this huge market momentum around looking at something new,"" said Tim Latimer, Fervo's chief executive. ""That's what allowed us to put geothermal on the map for the first time in a long time.""
Geothermal energy is more typically used for heating and cooling. This process relies on the steady underground temperature a short distance below the surface. That reduces the amount of heating and cooling needed on hot and cold days.
Fervo, by using horizontal drilling and pumping water underground through fractures in rock in a process similar to fracking, found that many more parts of the world could economically generate electricity from geothermal energy.
After the water is heated up deep underground, it returns to the surface, where it transfers the heat to another liquid with a lower boiling point. That generates steam, which spins turbines for generating electricity. Geothermal power is currently much pricier than wind, solar and natural-gas power, putting pressure on the industry to reduce costs.
Fervo is raising $244 million from investors including Devon, billionaire former Enron trader John Arnold, Liberty Mutual Investments and commodity trader Mercuria. Devon is putting in $100 million, one of the biggest such investments by an oil-and-gas company in a clean-energy startup.
BP was among the investors that recently put $182 million into Canadian startup Eavor Technologies, which counts Chevron among its early backers and tries to simplify geothermal by essentially burying a large radiator deep underground and circulating fluid through it. Chesapeake Energy recently made an early stage bet on a startup called Sage Geosystems that is led by a former Shell executive.
Old oil-and-gas wells could be retrofitted to produce geothermal power, while existing wells can extract geothermal energy alongside fossil fuels, potentially helping accelerate the industry's growth.
Oil companies understand subsurface geology, have experience building infrastructure projects and have cash available to deploy. That is why Chevron is joining with other companies and pursuing geothermal pilot projects in Japan, Indonesia and the U.S., said Barbara Harrison, vice president of offsets and emerging technologies at Chevron New Energies.
""We are choosing to pursue direct investment in novel geothermal technologies in a way that we've not directly invested in wind or solar,"" she said.
About 60% of Fervo's roughly 80 employees have an oil-and-gas background, said Latimer, a Texas native and former drilling engineer for BHP Billiton.
Fervo said drilling costs for its first four horizontal wells for a project in Utah fell to $4.8 million per well from $9.4 million a couple of years ago at its first commercial project in Nevada. The company aims to soon reach electricity costs around $100 per megawatt hour.
Fervo recently began sending electricity from the Nevada operation to the local grid to power Google data centers and other local projects. In Utah, it hopes to produce enough electricity to power hundreds of thousands of homes.
""Once the industry is proven, I would not be surprised for today's oil-and-gas industry to either buy or build their way to be significant players in advanced geothermal,"" said Arnold, a widely followed energy investor who put $30 million into Fervo through his family office.
Google is looking for more potential sites for geothermal power, said Maud Texier, the company's global director of clean energy and decarbonization development. Companies are willing to pay more for geothermal because it can be a hedge against wind and solar, she said. ""Corporate buyers have a key role to play,"" Texier said.
Additional support is coming from Washington. The Energy Department recently granted $60 million to a trio of projects from companies including Chevron and Fervo, with a further boost coming from tax credits that were part of the 2022 climate law.

Chevron warned investors Monday that Exxon Mobil and China's Cnooc are asserting they have a right to pre-empt the company's bid for a stake in a prolific oil project off Guyana, an emerging dispute that could derail Chevron's megadeal for Hess.
Chevron said in a regulatory filing that Exxon and Cnooc say they have the right to counter Chevron's offer for Hess's stake in the Guyana project, which Exxon operates and is one of the largest oil finds in years. Chevron warned investors it may not complete its purchase of Hess ""within the time frame the company anticipates or at all.""
Much of the value in Chevron's $53 billion all-stock acquisition of Hess proposed last year was tied to the smaller New York oil company's 30% stake in an Exxon-led drilling consortium in Guyanese waters. The partnership has expanded oil production far faster than most offshore oil projects and expects to pump over 1 million barrels a day in coming years.
The development is a potential blow to Chevron's largest acquisition in years, though it isn't clear if Exxon and Cnooc will make a counteroffer. At this point, they are only asserting it is their right to do so.
Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said Chevron and Hess don't believe a right of first refusal applies to the Hess deal. Chevron said the companies have engaged in ""constructive discussions,"" and though Chevron said the deal might fall apart, it believes the talks will ""result in an outcome"" that wouldn't delay or prevent the deal.
""We are fully committed to the transaction,"" Reddall said. ""There is no possible scenario in which Exxon or Cnooc could acquire Hess's interest in Guyana as a result of the Chevron-Hess transaction.""
If the talks fall apart, Chevron said in a regulatory filing, it or Hess could choose to have Hess's Guyana subsidiary pursue arbitration. A Hess spokeswoman referred inquiries to Chevron, and Cnooc didn't respond to a request for comment.
The dispute boils down to the terms of a joint operating agreement, or JOA, signed more than a decade ago, which governs the consortium. Hess had entered the JOA in 2014 when it purchased its stake from Shell. Some JOAs allow existing partners, like Exxon, to participate in ownership changes and pre-empt an offer for an ownership stake with an offer of their own.
Exxon spokeswoman Emily Mir said the conversations with Hess and Chevron are set to continue, and that the company is working with the Guyanese government on the matter.
""We owe it to our investors and partners to consider our pre-emption rights,"" Mir said. Exxon is trying ""to ensure we preserve our right to realize the significant value we've created"" in Guyana. Exxon didn't say whether it will make its own offer for Hess's stake.
The exact terms of the JOA weren't immediately clear, including whether pre-emption rights exist or whether Chevron or others would have the right to make another offer.
Exxon has a 45% share in the Guyana oil project and Cnooc owns the remaining 25%.
The clash with Exxon is a setback for Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth, who late last year disclosed delays and cost overruns for a massive oil project in Kazakhstan, as well as shareholder returns that have recently underperformed rival Exxon.
The California oil giant's attempt to join the jungle-covered South American country's oil boom has coincided with a retreat by the large American oil companies to the Western Hemisphere as global conflicts abound. Exxon lost its stake in a major Russian project following the Ukraine war.
Exxon and Chevron have sold off billions in assets in Asia and Africa in recent years, underscoring the growing importance of the U.S. shale plays and South America. Chevron last year began pumping oil in Venezuela again as the Biden administration eased sanctions. It helped to restore production there to faster growth than the market anticipated. It also is investing in Argentina's shale and is exploring for oil and gas off Suriname, near Guyana.
In recent months, Venezuela's President Nicholas Maduro has escalated its military presence near its border with Guyana, a country of 800,000 with little means of defense.
Exxon has assumed the lion's share of the risk in the Guyana project, drilling there for years before large amounts of oil were discovered. Exxon and its partners continue to drill for additional oil finds, and the project's value could increase substantially. Exxon estimates the Guyana project to house nearly 11 billion barrels of oil and gas."

Exxon Mobil and Chevron banked their second-highest annual profits in a decade last year, riding strong oil demand to solidify their standing among America's most prosperous companies despite mounting risks.
Exxon netted $36 billion and Chevron $21.4 billion. Exxon's profitability trailed only Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and a few others. Exxon and Chevron's earnings were down more than a third from record levels in 2022, but still well above historic averages.
Exxon reported $7.6 billion in fourth-quarter earnings, down 40% from the same period a year earlier. It took a $2 billion impairment charge as the result of what it called regulatory obstacles in California. The company touted cost cuts as its production rose to records in Guyana and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.
Chevron posted a $2.3 billion quarterly profit, down 64% from a year earlier, hit by a combined $4.2 billion in impairment charges, largely to assets in California, and other costs.
Across the oil industry, companies enjoyed another banner year after emerging from the pandemic, showing the durability of global demand for fossil fuels. On Thursday, European giant Shell said it collected $20 billion in profit for the year, measured on a similar metric to net income.
""In 2023, we returned more cash to shareholders and produced more oil and natural gas than any year in the company's history,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said.
Still, the oil giants are straddling the line between the present -- dominated by fossil fuels -- and an uncertain future that could bring dramatic changes to the way the world consumes energy. Exxon is keeping capital spending roughly flat this year, well below prepandemic levels, at up to $25 billion, while Chevron said in December it would boost spending to as much as $16.5 billion this year, from $15.8 billion in 2023. Most of that money will be invested in oil-and-gas production.
Shell has also been rewarded by some investors for plans to spend more on oil-and-gas production as laid out during Wael Sawan's first full year as CEO, as he dialed back on his predecessor's strategy to delve deeper into renewable energy.
But as the companies reap the rewards of fossil-fuel production, political backlash against the oil industry has recently ramped up. At the United Nations climate conference late last year in Dubai, known as COP28, more than 190 governments agreed to a pact calling for the world to move away from coal, oil and natural gas. Europe agreed to limit the allowable methane emissions of oil and natural gas it imports starting in 2030.
In January, the Biden administration effectively froze the approval process for new plants to export U.S. liquefied natural gas, handing a win to environmental groups pushing President Biden to rein in booming natural-gas exports. Exxon, Chevron and Shell all have large LNG businesses.
Sawan said the recent U.S. government decision to pause approvals of new LNG export terminals and the massive shipping disruptions in the Red Sea represented new risks. He added that 2024 will be ""a continued year of uncertainty and volatility.""
Part of Exxon's and Chevron's strategy to ride out the current uncertainty has been to shower their shareholders with cash. Exxon's shareholder distributions last year came to a record $32 billion; Chevron also hit a record, at $26 billion.
Those figures are more than either spent in the oil patch and they dwarf what the companies have committed to invest in new low-carbon ventures.
""Investors' appetite for aggressive growth and expansion projects remains muted,"" said Jeff Wyll, a senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman. ""The sector for far too long acted like a growth sector, and that led to an oversupplied market. They're exhibiting more discipline now.""
Exxon and Chevron plan to invest billions into low-carbon technologies, including biofuels, hydrogen and carbon capture. But, for now, most of their profits come from oil and gas."

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court appeared ready to overturn a 1984 case that business groups and conservative activists argue has handed too much power to unelected executive-branch bureaucrats -- a ruling Reagan-era conservatives originally hailed as a curb on overweening liberal judges.
Justice Neil Gorsuch led the charge during oral arguments Wednesday to overrule the precedent, Chevron USA v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which he said has given agencies license to run roughshod over the rights of individuals and others caught in the federal bureaucracy without adequate recourse to the courts. By letting agencies construe laws ""when Congress didn't think about the problem, the government always wins,"" he said.
The Chevron precedent directs federal judges to defer to an agency's interpretation of federal law when its language is ambiguous, rather than having courts substitute their own interpretation of statutes like the Endangered Species Act or the Clean Water Act. As a practical matter, it means that a regulation, unless it is an unreasonable reading of the statutory language, should be upheld.
Two cases argued separately Wednesday involve a federal program to protect Atlantic herring stocks, but the implications of overturning Chevron go well beyond fisheries, potentially limiting federal agencies' ability to issue a range of environmental, consumer and workplace regulations.
In Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce, conservative advocacy groups representing fishing businesses contest federal regulations requiring boat operators to pay for federally mandated monitors who ensure that herring quotas aren't exceeded.
Rather than accepting the fisheries agency's interpretation of its authority under an ambiguous law, the plaintiffs say judges should have given equal weight to the business argument and decided the best interpretation of the conservation law.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said there is often more than one reasonable way to read a statute. ""And the question is, Who makes the choice?"" she said.
Justice Elena Kagan offered an example of the kind of question that might arise: ""Is a new product designed to promote healthy cholesterol levels a dietary supplement or a drug?"" Such a question could determine whether the product must be proven safe and effective to go on sale.
The answer, she suggested, was better left for the Food and Drug Administration, whose staff has scientific and real-world experience with such matters, than a federal judge.
Paul Clement, a lawyer representing the fishing company Loper Bright Enterprises, said such problems had largely been resolved because of better methods of legal interpretation conservatives had championed in more recent years. Unlike in the era of the Chevron ruling, he said, today ""the focus is much greater on the text of the statute"" itself, leaving judges less room to impose their own policy preferences.
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, said Chevron not only was workable, but in 40 years had become ingrained in the lawmaking process, with Congress relying on agencies to fill the gaps in legislation. Deferring to agency judgments, as long as they are reasonable, promotes stability and uniformity in federal law, she said, with a single approach applying nationwide rather than various decisions by federal courts across the country.
Justice Brett Kavanaugh countered that the administrative leeway provided by Chevron had the opposite effect. ""The reality of how this works is Chevron itself ushers in shocks to the system every four or eight years when a new administration comes in,"" he said.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business groups have filed briefs supporting the plaintiffs. The AFL-CIO and consumer, environmental and health organizations have urged the court to leave Chevron intact.
In the 1984 Chevron case, the Supreme Court reasoned that executive-branch agencies are better positioned than federal judges to apply the statutes they were assigned to implement -- and if an agency's regulations are out of line, it can be held accountable through the elected president.
Conservatives argue that over decades of congressional gridlock, Chevron deference -- as the doctrine is known -- has given federal agencies an end run around the lawmaking process.
The original name of the case tells the story: Natural Resources Defense Council v. Gorsuch -- Anne Gorsuch Burford, that is, the late mother of Justice Gorsuch, whom President Ronald Reagan had appointed to run the Environmental Protection Agency.
The case involved the Reagan administration's appeal of a decision preventing the EPA from relaxing a Carter-era regulation requiring aggressive efforts to upgrade pollution-emitting equipment at power plants and other facilities.
Three justices recused themselves, and Justice John Paul Stevens was selected to write for the 6-0 majority, which found the Clean Air Act language ambiguous and the EPA chief's reading of its requirements to be reasonable."

Judging by the left's reaction, the Supreme Court's oral arguments on Wednesday in two cases challenging the doctrine of Chevron deference didn't go well for the government. ""Disturbing oral arguments suggest dark turn for Supreme Court,"" moaned the Alliance for Justice. Progressives are disturbed that the Justices might make Congress do its job.
Wednesday's cases (Relentless v. Dept. of Commerce, and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo) concern a regulation issued by the Trump Administration. Commerce contends that the government can force herring fisheries to pay for on-board federal monitors because federal law is silent on the matter. Lower courts agreed based on the Court's Chevron doctrine, which requires judges to defer to regulators when the text is ambiguous as long as their interpretation of the law is reasonable.
Justice Elena Kagan said it's up to Congress to overturn Chevron. But as fisheries' attorney Paul Clement rightly rejoined: ""I'm not sure everybody in Congress wants to overrule Chevron . . . It's really convenient for some members of Congress not to have to tackle the hard questions and to rely on their friends in the executive branch to get them everything they want.""
He added that even if Congress were to pass a law overturning Chevron, ""the President would veto it."" In any event, he said, Chevron wrongly ""assumes that ambiguity is always a delegation"" to the executive branch. More often, ambiguity is ""'I don't have enough votes in Congress to make it clear, so I'm going to leave it ambiguous . . . and then we'll give it to my friends in the agency.'""
By allowing Congress to pass off responsibility to regulators, Chevron has contributed to legislative dysfunction and gridlock. Congress has failed to pass a law regulating crypto-currency after the FTX fiasco, Mr. Clement said, ""because there's an agency head out there that thinks that he already has the authority to address this uniquely 21st century problem with a couple of statutes passed in the 1930s.""
Perhaps he means Securities and Exchange Chairman Gary Gensler. ""And he's going to wave his wand, and he's going to say the words 'investment contract' are ambiguous,"" Mr. Clement said. Or consider that the Federal Communications Commission has rewritten broadband regulation four times in 14 years.
It's not too much to say Chevron has corrupted all three branches of government. It lets Congress abdicate its duty to write clear laws, the bureaucracy to grab more power, and the courts to abandon their normal method of judicial review. Time for the High Court to restore constitutional equilibrium."

Conservatives often criticize liberal jurists for ""judicial activism"" -- disregarding laws passed by elected legislators and imposing their own policy preferences instead. On Wednesday the Supreme Court will consider whether to overturn a precedent that went too far in the other direction by surrendering the judicial role of interpreting the law and handing it to unelected bureaucrats and agency heads.
Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo is a case about fishing regulation. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued a rule requiring the plaintiffs to pay the costs of carrying federal conservation monitors aboard their vessels. The fishermen argued that the service had no legal authority to do so, but the high court's precedent in Chevron v. NRDC (1984) obligated the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to defer to the government's interpretation of an ""ambiguous"" statute.
Chevron was an ""accidental landmark,"" as legal scholar Thomas Merrill put it in 2014. At issue in the case was a Clean Air Act regulation interpreting the term ""stationary source"" to refer to an entire facility rather than a single smokestack. This definition enabled facilities to make changes that didn't increase their total pollution without triggering onerous permitting requirements for ""new or modified"" sources. The justices upheld the regulation, deferring to the agency's interpretation of ""ambiguous"" text.
For as long as they'd had the power to do so, federal courts interpreted statutes for themselves where necessary to decide a case, including in cases challenging agencies' positions on the laws they administer. Chevron superseded that approach with a blanket rule of deference.
It's unclear if the high court intended this fundamental change. Chevron's author, Justice John Paul Stevens, regarded the decision as ordinary pragmatism: ""When I am so confused, I go with the agency,"" he told his colleagues as they discussed the case in conference.
By all indications, Chevron's reasoning was driven by the need to assemble a court majority on a difficult interpretive question. That explains the decision's failure to grapple with the obvious consequences of its logic. The Constitution vests the ""judicial power"" in the courts. ""It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is,"" as Chief Justice John Marshall wrote in Marbury v. Madison (1803). Chevron bucked that constitutional command without acknowledging that it did so.
Chevron deference also conflicts with the Administrative Procedure Act of 1946, which provides that a ""reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law"" and ""interpret constitutional and statutory provisions."" Chevron doesn't cite the APA.
While few appreciated Chevron's import when it was handed down, its potential was apparent to the Justice Department. The Reagan administration seized on the decision as a corrective to the judicial activism of lower courts, especially the D.C. Circuit, in blocking its deregulatory agenda. The Chevron doctrine bulldozed the policy-driven obstacles courts had thrown up to block regulatory reforms. It gained adherents among newly appointed textualist judges like Antonin Scalia and Kenneth Starr on the D.C. Circuit, who favored judicial restraint.
But over the years Chevron became less about judicial restraint and more about agency dominance. With the movement toward textualism, led by Justices Scalia and Clarence Thomas, courts gradually returned to constrained formalism in interpreting statutes. Armed with the Chevron doctrine, however, the administrative state learned to wield its new interpretive power to maximum effect.
Deference might have been relatively harmless if agencies engaged in a good-faith effort to carry out unclear statutes. But beginning in the Clinton administration, Chevron changed the way they go about their business. Instead of asking what Congress meant, agency lawyers and decision makers hunt for ambiguities, real or imagined, to justify their policy objectives.
As agencies relied more on Chevron to pursue policy agendas, judges were forced to confront a greater range of asserted ""ambiguities"" with no standard to distinguish among them. Judicial review is the essential check on executive overreach, yet Chevron put a brick on the scale by committing the courts to favor the government's positions. It is all too easy for courts, when faced with difficult or contentious interpretive questions, to waive the ambiguity flag and defer.
By aggrandizing the power of unelected bureaucrats, the Chevron doctrine also diminishes Congress. Witness the unseemly but now-routine spectacle of lawmakers hectoring the president and agencies to enact policy programs -- from student-loan forgiveness to the expansion of antitrust law and greenhouse gas-regulation -- rather than legislating themselves. The prospect of achieving an uncompromised policy win through executive action has replaced the give-and-take of the legislative process.
But the victories achieved in this fashion are only as durable as the current administration, and each new president takes office with a longer list of ""day one"" executive actions to reverse his predecessor and implement his own agenda. Donald Trump raised hackles last month when he said he would be a ""dictator,"" but only on ""day one."" He was describing the post-Chevron presidency.
The principal argument of Chevron's defenders is ""reliance."" Ending deference to agencies, they say, would create regulatory uncertainty and threaten the viability of the administrative state. But what reliance interest can there be in a doctrine that empowers agencies to change course on a political whim, over and again?
The Supreme Court has already been moving away from Chevron deference, which it hasn't applied since 2016. The Covid pandemic heightened the need for agency flexibility, yet none of the justices' pandemic-policy decisions resorted to deference. In recent years, 13 states have rejected Chevron-style deference in interpreting state law without consequence.
Chevron's rule of deference is an abdication of judicial duty, not an exercise in judicial restraint. It has proved unworkable and corrosive to the constitutional separation of powers. Forty years later, the court should correct its mistake.

The Supreme Court has been trying to restore the proper constitutional balance of power, and its next opportunity comes Wednesday when it hears two cases challenging its own landmark Chevron doctrine (Loper Bright Enterprises, Inc., v. Raimondo and Relentless, Inc. v. Dept. of Commerce).
In 1984 in Chevron v. NRDC, the Justices ruled that courts should defer to administrative agencies' interpretation of laws when the statutory text is silent or ambiguous. In practice this has become a license for Congress to write vague laws that delegate legislative power to administrative agencies. Over the last 40 years the federal register of regulations has grown by tens of thousands of pages.
Wednesday's cases are textbook examples of how regulators invoke Chevron to expand their power and impose enormous burdens on Americans. Family-owned herring fisheries and vessel operators are challenging an obscure Commerce rule that requires New England fisheries to pay for on-board monitors.
The 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Act regulates fishery management in federal waters and permits the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to require vessels to ""carry"" federal observers to enforce its regulations. But only in three narrow circumstances does the law require vessels to pay for their federal monitors -- none of which apply to the plaintiffs.
Congress declined to appropriate funds to pay for on-board monitors to enforce fishing regulations, so NMFS in 2020 decided to compel the fisheries to foot the cost. The agency estimated that a monitor would cost fisheries $710 a day and reduce annual financial returns by about 20%.
Two appellate courts ruled for the agency based on a two-step Chevron analysis. Courts first review if a law is clear. If the text is ambiguous or silent on a matter, courts must consider if an agency's interpretation is reasonable. If judges rule it is, they must defer to the agency.
A First Circuit Court of Appeals panel upheld the fisheries rule because the ""default norm"" is ""the government does not reimburse regulated entities for the cost of complying with properly enacted regulations."" A divided D.C. Circuit panel found the law was somewhat ambiguous, but the agency's interpretation was reasonable.
But as D.C. Circuit Judge Justin Walker noted in dissent, ""Congress unambiguously did not"" authorize NMFS's mandate. The agency ""identified no other context in which an agency, without express direction from Congress, requires an industry to fund its inspection regime,"" and the government's theory could ""undermine Congress's power of the purse.""
Chevron arose when judges were willy-nilly substituting their policy preferences for those of the elected branch. But the doctrine has no constitutional basis, and it defies the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires that ""the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.""
As the fisheries argue, the doctrine also violates the Constitution's Due Process Clause ""by requiring courts to systematically place a thumb on the scale against the citizenry."" While agencies' purely factual findings may deserve judicial deference, requiring courts to defer to regulators on the law undermines the separation of powers.
The late Justice Antonin Scalia supported Chevron after he joined the Court, but he later expressed misgivings as judges bowed to regulators even when they were stretching or rewriting the law. One result has been pendulum swings in public policy with every new presidential administration as agencies reinterpret laws to advance their agenda.
---
The current Supreme Court has danced around Chevron for several terms. In 2022 it overruled a D.C. Circuit decision that upheld a hospital drug payment rule under Chevron but declined to overturn the precedent.
The Court has relied instead on its major questions doctrine to strike down such executive overreach as the Biden student loan forgiveness. But why should federal agencies benefit from a lower standard of judicial review for regulations that judges deem minor but which are enormously consequential for particular parties?
The Justice Department invokes stare decisis for preserving Chevron. But stare decisis carries less weight when the Court is reviewing judge-made interpretive methods than it does in other kinds of cases. Overturning Chevron is an important act of judicial housecleaning that would rein in the administrative state and encourage Congress to write clear laws."

I'm less hostile than many conservatives toward Chevron v. NRDC (1984), the Supreme Court decision that instructs judges to defer to certain agency interpretations of statutes they administer, which the justices will reconsider next week. My ambivalence springs in part from filial loyalty -- my father, Justice Antonin Scalia, was Chevron's foremost champion before souring on such deference doctrines in his last years.
Additionally, I once enjoyed Chevron deference myself, as labor secretary under President Trump. And boy did I enjoy it. After decades as a practicing lawyer pleading before federal judges, finally they had to defer to me.
Kidding aside, as secretary I had good reasons to favor deference. It strengthened my department's hand and our ability to implement the president's agenda. It could also help bring uniformity to the law, and I adopted two rules partly for this reason. One rule distinguished independent contractors from employees for purposes of the wage and hour laws. The other delineated when two companies are the so-called joint employers of a worker, so that each company must ensure the minimum wage and overtime are paid.
Both of these were important legal issues the Supreme Court hadn't addressed in decades. In the lower courts, the legal test being applied varied by circuit. My rules were intended to bring clarity and consistency, in a way that I thought reflected the right view as a matter of both law and policy.
As secretary I was nonetheless conscious of a peculiarity to the deference my interpretations suddenly were due. For the first time since I became a lawyer, I wasn't doing much interpreting. Often, my job involved choosing among a menu of options presented by staff. What the law said was an important factor in determining that menu, but in many cases it wasn't a factor I gave much thought because it was the responsibility of my lawyers to ensure the options I was given were legally viable.
To be clear, there were times as secretary that I posed legal questions -- more than most labor secretaries, no doubt. But I had already been labor solicitor, the department's top lawyer, years earlier. Someone else was solicitor now, and I wanted her to do that job while I focused on mine.
Does it tell us anything about Chevron that the officials whose interpretations receive deference seldom interpret? At minimum, Chevron deference is a misnomer. You don't defer to someone's performance of something he didn't do. My actions were policy choices, often outfitted after the fact with legal explanations I didn't review. For an agency interpretation to be authoritative, courts have said, it has to come from a senior official -- a cabinet secretary or agency head. But the people actually doing the interpreting often are staff lawyers at a much lower level in the agency.
The problem runs deeper. Some agency heads not only don't interpret; at times they're indifferent to -- even contemptuous of -- the right legal answer. For my part, I read statutes, edited draft rules, and never took a position that I thought was wrong legally. But that isn't necessarily typical. Many agency heads aren't lawyers, and countless factors influence their decisions: the president's goals, the forcefully stated views of a budget committee chairman, even anxiety about what the media will say and how that might affect the agency head's prospects for some future job he's eyeing. For some decision makers, these factors will supersede legal considerations. Some rules get adopted against the advice of the lawyers -- the actual interpreters.
The decider might say to his lawyers: ""I hear you about legal risk. But I'm going to do what's right. After all, it's possible no one will sue over this rule. And if they do, I might win -- you just admitted you can't be 100% sure what the courts will say. And if I lose, then it's on the judges. Everyone will know I did the right thing.""
That wasn't my method, but it happens. And it punctuates this peculiarity of Chevron deference: that courts at times defer to ""interpretations"" that the agency's interpreters thought were wrong, and which were adopted because the decider was contemptuous of the law's meaning. A court never knows when this is how an interpretation was adopted.
A coda regarding those two rules I adopted in hopes of bringing consistency to the law: My successor as secretary set about undoing both. In the case of independent contractors, the department on Tuesday adopted a new rule with a diametrically opposed approach. Expect litigation to commence immediately over which rule should remain in place, the one I adopted or the new one.
I had hoped that by acting through rule making, rather than opinion letters or ""guidance,"" the department would provide interpretations that proved durable, leaving the law more settled and predictable than before. Events proved me wrong.
So, to an extent, have they proved Chevron wrong. Once heralded as a way to use agency expertise to bring clarity and consistency to the law, the doctrine often is experienced by the public today as a series of sharp vacillations in the law, as one administration succeeds another. Presidents turn increasingly to the administrative state to implement priorities they can't enact through Congress. Each administration improves on its predecessor's playbook, becoming swifter and more adept at identifying legal positions it wants to change and issuing rules and decisions to do so.
This will be on the justices' minds next week, too.

Chevron said it will book $3.5 billion to $4 billion in charges for the fourth quarter, citing challenges tied to regulations in California and previously sold oil-and-gas production assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
Chevron said it will impair a portion of its U.S. upstream assets, mostly in California, because of regulatory challenges in the state that have led to ""lower anticipated future investment levels in its business plans."" Chevron said it will continue to operate the affected assets for many years.
The company also said companies that agreed to buy Chevron's oil-and-gas production assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protections. Chevron said the obligations for the assets could revert back to the company, and that it will decommission the assets over the next decade."

Congratulations to California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is succeeding at his goal of driving away fossil fuel investment and jobs, even while failing to reduce global CO2 emissions. See Chevron's announcement Tuesday that it is writing down its upstream assets in the Golden State owing to ""continuing regulatory challenges.""
Chevron's write-down acknowledges what the company has been telling California lawmakers for some time: Their energy policies are making the state uninvestable. These include the state cap-and-trade program, low-carbon fuel standard, penalty on ""excessive"" refiner margins, and a 2022 law limiting new drilling within 3,200 feet of homes and schools.
California policies have made it ""riskier than investing in other states, with projects being lower in quality and higher in cost,"" Chevron's Americas Products business president Andy Walz wrote last month in a filing with the California Energy Commission. ""Chevron alone has reduced spending in California by hundreds of millions of dollars since 2022.""
""We have rejected capital projects"" and canceled some ""due to permitting challenges,"" Mr. Walz noted, adding that California's ""arbitrary attacks on a disfavored industry . . . signal to every industry, entrepreneur, manufacturer, and employer that California is closed for business.""
They've gotten that signal. Employment in California has declined by 77,700 over the last year.
In California's oil-rich Kern County around Bakersfield, unemployment is 7.8%—more than two times the national average. California's policies aren't reducing oil production or CO2 emissions in the U.S. or around the world. They are merely driving oil jobs and investment elsewhere. Chevron is increasing investment in U.S. shale and offshore Guyana with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess.
U.S. oil production has surged to a record 13.2 million barrels a day despite higher interest rates and President Biden's best efforts to crush the industry. One reason is that shale fracking is predominantly occurring on private and state land in places like Texas and North Dakota. The courts helped by blocking Mr. Biden's moratorium on oil and gas leasing on federal land.
Oil production in the Permian basin in the Southwest exceeds its pre-pandemic peak by about one million barrels a day, which has more than offset the 100,000 barrels a day decline in California. Over the last decade, production in California has fallen by nearly half amid increasing climate regulation while output from the Permian has quadrupled.
Mr. Biden has frackers and Republican-led states to thank for why gas prices nationwide aren't $5 a gallon as they are in California."

The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Chevron's $53 billion proposed deal to buy Hess, the second-biggest oil megamerger this year.
Chevron and Hess said Friday the antitrust enforcer is seeking additional information about the merger, a move signaling the commission is reviewing whether the deal could be anticompetitive under U.S. law.
The companies' disclosure comes on the heels of another new FTC merger investigation, this one into Exxon Mobil's $59.5 billion all-stock deal to scoop up Pioneer Natural Resources. It would be the largest oil-and-gas transaction since Exxon's $75 billion merger with Mobil in the late 1990s.
Chevron's purchase of Hess would make the oil major a partner in an Exxon-led consortium developing a generational oil find in Guyana, where Hess has a 30% stake. Chevron would also acquire assets in North Dakota's Bakken Shale, where Hess is one of dozens of operators.
Braden Reddall, a spokesman for Chevron, said the company is working productively with the commission and will respond to its request ""in a timely manner to advance a successful close of the transaction.""
The oil-and-gas assets owned by Chevron and Hess have little overlap compared with the Exxon-Pioneer tie-up. That deal would make Exxon the largest operator by far in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the country's most active oil field. Exxon has noted their combined production would only make up about 3% of the world's daily output, and 5% of U.S. oil-and-gas production.
The commission and the Justice Department typically probe about 2% to 3% of deals that are reported to the government. Those agencies can take companies to court to try to block a merger.
Agencies with antitrust authority have rarely taken action against oil-and-gas producers, often taking the view they compete in a global market. Some oil executives and deal makers had anticipated a recent series of acquisitions would draw antitrust scrutiny, but have said they saw little chance the FTC would prevail in court if it pursued legal action.
Under the Biden administration, the commission has become more active in taking action against large mergers, challenging 11 deals in court. Five deals were canceled after the FTC filed lawsuits to block them.
But the commission has lost some antitrust court challenges against large companies such as Microsoft, which a judge allowed this summer to purchase Activision Blizzard for $75 billion."

Give John Kerry credit for persistence if not realism. President Biden's climate envoy keeps demanding the end of fossil fuels while the world continues to blow through his apocalyptic warnings.
A new report in time for the COP28 climate conference in Dubai says that global CO2 emissions will hit a new peak this year. But Mr. Kerry keeps berating American fossil fuels producers though U.S. emissions are on track to fall 4% in 2023. The big problem: China's emissions are set to rise by twice as much as the U.S. decline.
The Global Carbon Project estimates that worldwide CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels will increase 1.1% this year. That represents a slowdown from the last two decades. Yet emissions would have to drop by 9% annually to achieve the Paris climate agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
Mr. Kerry rapped U.S. oil and gas producers at this week's United Nations climate confab for not doing enough. ""We have no real evidence that [Chevron] and a lot of others are doing what every company needs to do,"" he said. Well, actually, there is evidence that oil and gas producers are helping reduce emissions.
U.S. and European emissions this year are projected to fall by a combined 0.4 gigatons of CO2—about as much as 87 million gas-powered cars generate—owing largely to natural gas replacing coal. Increased U.S. natural gas production, especially in the Marcellus and Permian shale basins, drove down domestic prices and displaced coal power.
U.S. coal emissions this year will be roughly half as much as in 2015. Liquefied natural gas exports to Europe also helped replace Russian gas while a relatively warm winter reduced demand for heating fuel. Not that the West's emissions reductions will matter much as long as China and India continue to build more coal plants.
China's emissions this year are set to climb by 0.5 gigatons while India's will increase by 0.3 gigatons. Last year China approved 106 gigawatts of new coal power, four times as much as in 2021 and about as much as the peak electricity demand in France and Britain combined. Western leaders can keep tilting at windmills while China burns more coal.
Irony alert: China's National Development and Reform Commission says that at least 200 gigawatts of coal capacity will be needed to support its solar and wind energy build-out. Beijing has figured out what President Biden and the climate left haven't: Solar and wind energy can provide cheap power at the margin but must be backed up by fossil fuels or nuclear power. Batteries are getting better, but they are still expensive and can't scale.
In other words, in the name of reducing CO2 emissions, China is increasing CO2 emissions. That more or less sums up the failure of the climate lobby."

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Nov. 26 -- Overall natural-gas production in the energy-hungry country plummeted by nearly a third, worsening the persisting crisis in gas-guzzling industries, power plants, fertiliser factories, commercial entities and households.According to state-owned Petrobangla, the overall natural gas output on November 24 was around 2,613 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), which is around 30.50-per- cent lower than Bangladesh's overall production capacity of 3,716mmcfd.Country's overall natural gas output is, however, nearly half of overall demand, which is projected by Petrobangla above 4,000mmcfd.The gas crisis is now affecting all sorts of consumers, resulting in cut in industrial output and abject sufferings of the commoners, market- insiders said.Sources said gas supply across Bangladesh had begun falling sharply early this month as US multinational Excelerate Energy ceased LNG re-gasification at its plant for its overhauling and capacity expansion.Excellence, Bangladesh's first floating storage and re-gasification unit (FSRU) owned by Excelerate Energy, closed operations on November 1 and went for its first-ever overhauling, which was long-overdue for renovation work.Country's liquefied natural gas (LNG) dropped by 43 per cent to around 540mmcfd from previous 950mmcfd as the re-gasification is done by only one FSRU instead of previous two, according to official data of Petrobangla.Previously, when the country was dependent on one FSRU for LNG re-gasification last year, Petrobangla had to ration gas supplies to industries and power plants and the country had to rely more on oil-fired power plants.To avoid similar energy crunch ahead of the general election, slated for January 2024, Petrobangla has urged the largest-natural gas producer, Chevron, to augment overall natural gas output by at least 50mmcfd from its three onshore gas fields, a senior Petrobangla official said.As on November 24, 2023, Chevron Bangladesh Ltd was producing around 1,246 mmcfd of natural gas from three operating onshore fields - Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulvibazar - located in blocks 12, 13 and 14 respectively.Chevron's gas production currently accounts for over 60 per cent of the total output from local gas fields, according to Petrobangla data.Bangladesh's overall natural gas output is currently hovering around 2,613 mmcfd including 540 mmcfd regasified LNG, further reveal Petrobangla data.But, sources said, Chevron currently does not have any scope to enhance gas output from any of its three operating fields.It can, however, ramp up output once the drilling result of its 27th well in the country's largest-producing Bibiyana gas field comes out positive.Even with due gas bills ballooning, sources said, Chevron started drilling the 27th well in Bibiyana gas field a couple of months back.The gas field under block 12 in north-eastern Habiganj district is currently spewing around 1,060mmcfd gas, which accounts for over half the total output from local gas fields.Regarding gas crisis, executive president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) Mohammad Hatem says, ""We are not getting sufficient quantity of natural gas, which is hampering industrial output badly.""If natural gas is found in some areas in the morning, they are not getting in the evening, he said as an instance of the crunch.Similarly, if the industries get gas in the evening, they are not getting the fuel in the morning, the export-industry leader rues.Industrial output nearly halved as a consequence of fuel fiasco, Mr Hatem adds.The compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations are getting lower than expected gas pressure in many areas where gas-transmission pipelines are narrow, general secretary of Bangladesh CNG Filling Station and Conversion Workshop Owners Association Farhan Noor told the FE.""Natural-gas-pressure requirement in CNG filling stations is around 15 per square inch (psi), but the stations nearing some industrial areas get around 4-45psi often, and in many other areas, it turns to almost zero psi,"" he alleged.Power plants are also not getting required gas to generate electricity.Some two and a half dozen gas-fired power plants are now shut as the state-run Petrobangla could supply around 812 mmcfd of natural gas to power plants against their demand for 2,240mmcfd, according to official data as on November 24.Residents of different areas in the capital city, Dhaka, are facing acute gas crisis and failing to cook food with the fuel although they are paying gas bills to the government, it has been alleged.Commoners in Mirpur, Gabtoli, Savar, Bashabo, Khilgaon and Paltan areas are the worst-affected ones.[email protected]Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

In the past month, two megadeals have been launched in the oil and gas industry: the announced acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources by ExxonMobil and Chevron's planned takeover of Hess.
In the Pioneer deal, Exxon will become the dominant operator in the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the US. And in acquiring Hess, Chevron will become one of the largest producers in the Bakken Formation (and gains a foothold in Guyana where Exxon already has a leading presence).
Both acquisitions were accompanied by triumphal announcements regarding the long-term outlook for fossil fuel demand, including Chevron's chief executive challenging the International Energy Agency's projections of a peak in fossil fuel demand in the next decade.
Yet the rationale for these transactions can be squared with either view of oil demand. For Exxon, in particular, expansion in the Permian offers a path to profitability even in significantly lower long-term fossil fuel demand scenarios, with estimated production costs of approximately $35 a barrel.
Permian shale patch production, which has a typically short cycle of development and exploitation, also offers the ability to flex production up and down more easily in response to changes in demand.
Megaprojects, by contrast, can take up to a decade to start producing and even longer to start generating a return.
This stands in marked contrast to Exxon's stance on capital allocation a couple of years ago, when I led a campaign with my former colleagues at Engine No. 1 to replace members of the oil group's board.
The company at that point had for years disregarded the market's preference for focusing on value over volumes ? and was instead setting capital expenditure levels by reference to market share rather than expected returns.
As a result, its shares had underperformed those of its peers for years, even before Covid-19. In fact, Exxon had spent so heavily that at the start of 2020, the estimated oil price required for its projects to break even was close to $90 ? almost 50 per cent higher than its closest peers, including Chevron.
At the time, there were also no independent directors with outside energy experience. This is why investors were open to change. They were under no illusion that Exxon would stop investing in oil and gas; in fact, in our first letter we noted ? just as Exxon's chief executive did in announcing the Pioneer deal ? that oil and gas companies must spend to offset natural decline rates.
But we also argued that Exxon should spend more intelligently to account for long-term demand uncertainty.
Specifically, we called for focusing on projects that would deliver a rate of return well above the company's cost of capital under a wider variety of longterm demand scenarios and we highlighted the Permian Basin ? as well as Guyana ? as meeting that criterion.
This is why, despite the public debate about the direction and speed of the energy transition, the real focus for oil and gas companies will continue to be around capital allocation in a time of uncertainty.
Exxon and Chevron may be right that oil and gas demand will grow far beyond the expectations of the IEA or the hopes of citizens wishing to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
Recent events include a rise in interest rates and supply chain issues that have dented the economics of renewables while there's been minimal progress at the COP26 and 27 summits on climate change and, most likely, COP28, starting later this month in Dubai.
Exxon is also not wrong when it says it cannot move faster than the pace of the energy transition (leaving aside the matter of its historical role in slowing this transition), as other producers would simply pick up the slack.
Still, I believe that long-term investors continue to prefer Exxon to eschew a strategy of chasing market share without sufficient regard to returns, instead focusing on lower cost projects offering greater flexibility if the pace of the energy transition increases over time.
The stock market certainly does, with Exxon outperforming Chevron substantially since the former embraced a more disciplined capital allocation strategy during the proxy campaign.
With this acquisition, Exxon enhances its flexibility for the future.
However, it will be up to investors to again hold the company accountable should it return to a strategy rejected not just by those focused on climate change but those focused solely on shareholder returns as well.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Oil bosses in Europe are intent on closing the valuation gap with their American rivals. This doesn't automatically mean they will follow Exxon Mobil and Chevron down the megamerger path.
""M&A is not really on our minds, if I'm honest,"" BP interim boss Murray Auchincloss said on the company's earnings call this week when asked for his reaction to Exxon Mobil's and Chevron's recent multibillion-dollar spending spree.
With oil at around $90 a barrel, BP thinks it makes sense to exploit the 36 billion barrels already in its portfolio rather than rush out to buy more. The company plans to grow its U.S. production by 7% annually between now and 2030 but also wants to bulk up on businesses that should do well during the energy transition, such as electric-vehicle charging.
Shell, which released solid third-quarter results on Thursday, also said it would prioritize running what it already owns as efficiently as possible. And CEO Wael Sawan told The Wall Street Journal that the company is better off spending billions of dollars on its own shares right now. ""We are a better investment than many other inorganic options out there.""
Shell and BP may be less relaxed about the American deals than they are willing to admit in public. And there is speculation that the two companies could merge, with smaller businesses or even with each other. But European oil companies' lower stock market valuations make all-share offers for U.S. assets tricky. High energy prices mean they are still producing plenty of cash that could be used for acquisitions. But Shell and BP are more cautious about long-term demand for oil than their American peers.
Besides, Shell and BP aren't cheaper than Exxon Mobil and Chevron because of their smaller size -- shareholders are dubious about the Europeans' clean energy investments. Headlines this week about turmoil in U.S. offshore wind won't help to boost confidence in renewables. In its latest quarterly results, BP took a $540 million impairment on its New York offshore wind farm projects. And shares of Danish wind-farm developer Orsted tanked more than 20% Wednesday after it halted two U.S. projects that no longer make sense financially.
European oil majors would first need to agree on where to invest before they could justify a big merger. Shell and BP have already changed tack with their green investments. BP says it will focus on biofuels and EV charging, where returns are higher than wind and solar. The company will only invest in renewable power to take carbon emissions out of its own business. Shell also wants to use renewable power to reduce emissions in day-to-day operations and thinks its trading division will eventually generate profits trading green energy.
Ironically, last month's megamergers in the U.S. have been helpful: Exxon Mobil and Chevron have fallen in value since announcing their respective takeovers of Pioneer and Hess, narrowing the trans-Atlantic gap further. Weak third-quarter results may also have played a role.
The real game-changer for Shell and BP would be if public market investors began to give them credit for their low-carbon assets. The 10 biggest constituents of the S&P Global Clean Energy Index trade at a multiple of 17 times forecast earnings, much higher than fossil-fuel companies in Europe or stateside.
But that will take a very long time. The wall of cash looking for green energy investments needs to see much more progress -- perhaps 40% or 50% of profits coming from low-carbon businesses, or a larger share of capital expenditure being spent on clean energy -- to feel comfortable holding oil-and-gas stocks.
No one seems to agree on how quickly the world's energy system can cut emissions. Exxon Mobil doesn't see demand for oil falling at all between now and 2050, while the International Energy Agency thinks peak oil demand is just a handful of years away.
That makes it tough for traditional energy companies to know which way to jump, making the case for a European megamerger even less clear."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Exxon Mobil and Chevron are good at squeezing hydrocarbons out of the ground. Digging for extra Brownie points from investors has been tougher.
The companies have tried hard to be attractive, first by continuously demonstrating spending discipline and consistently doling out generous shareholder returns. Most recently, both announced mega acquisitions at reasonable prices.
Exxon just acquired some of the best acreage in the prolific Permian Basin, paying a 9% premium on Pioneer Natural Resources' 30-day volume-weighted average price as of Oct. 5. Chevron, meanwhile, added some valuable Guyana exposure, paying a 10.3% premium on Hess's 20-day average price on Oct 20. With these acquisitions, research firm Wood Mackenzie estimates that the two U.S. oil companies combined will generate more than half of the total free cash flow of the seven major oil companies by the mid-2030s in its base case oil-price scenario.
On Friday, Exxon announced a 4% dividend increase -- more generous than last year's hike of 3%. Both are still generating a lot of free cash flow and returning a good amount of it to shareholders: Exxon and Chevron have paid out $24 billion and $20 billion, respectively, in dividends and buybacks year to date.
But both companies saw their share prices slip since announcing their megadeals. On Friday after both released quarterly results, their shares took a further leg down -- Chevron by 6.7% and Exxon by 1.9%.
Lukewarm results deserve some of the blame. Exxon's net income in the third quarter fell 54% from a year earlier to $9.1 billion, a slightly worse result than Wall Street expectations of a 52% decline. Chevron's net profit was 42% lower, worse than the 38% decline that analysts had estimated.
Exxon said its energy-products segment was negatively affected by unfavorable timing of its hedges, which will unwind over time. Its chemicals segment, meanwhile, succumbed to compressed industry margins. Chevron reported worse-than-expected international downstream results, which were affected by lower margins on refined-product sales and lower refinery runs because of planned shutdowns.
The two companies might have unwittingly signaled less confidence to the market by using their stock as currency for their deals. For one, it demonstrates that they believe their shares are fully valued. Furthermore, growth by acquisition telegraphs slightly less confidence in oil's longevity -- a truly bullish move would be to devote resources to entirely new production.
One read of the reaction so far could be that investors fundamentally aren't willing to assign much more value to energy companies, even the largest ones with huge cash-flow potential. Another explanation is that investors simply need to see more evidence of synergy and cash-flow potential before getting excited about the announced deals.
Negotiating a megadeal is one thing. Convincing investors of its value is another matter."

One of the first things you notice when entering the Hess Tower in downtown Houston is the original forest-green truck that Leon Hess drove around New Jersey nearly a century ago to deliver fuel.
Now, the Hess name is set to disappear from the ranks of the world's prominent oil companies. Chevron last Monday said it would acquire the family company for $53 billion, concluding a 90-year saga bookended by the gruff founding father and his gregarious son, current Chief Executive John Hess.
The merger marks the end of an era as Hess was the last major U.S. oil company controlled by a single family. The enterprise was a throwback to the great family dynasties that propelled American industry, including the Rockefellers and the Gettys, and the luxury and glamour that accompanied them.
The Hesses transcended plebeian roots to ensconce themselves in Manhattan and the Hamptons. Their oil empire afforded them the perks of outrageous wealth: private jets, Bahamian vacations, luxury real estate and, for a time, owning the New York Jets.
The dynasty has loomed large over the oil patch since 1933, when Leon Hess got tired of lugging bags of coal and started distributing heating oil. Walking in the footsteps of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil, he built a fuel-marketing business that covered the East Coast with Hess-branded gas stations. He also ran what was once the world's largest refinery.
In the following decades, the company dotted North Dakota with rigs during the shale boom, drilled in the Gulf of Mexico and helped uncover one of the biggest oil fields in South America.
John Hess, 69, had hoped for his son Michael to take over the business as recently as 2013, but at some point dropped those plans, according to people familiar with the matter. Michael was cultivating other interests beyond the family business and pursuing a career in finance at top firms. Recently, the CEO hadn't anointed a successor and was prepared to remain at the helm of the company for years.
Michael Hess couldn't be reached for comment.
In 2013, hedge fund Elliott Management pushed for a board overhaul and a split of Hess into an international and a domestic company, among other changes. It eventually reached a settlement that saw Hess appoint three Elliott nominees on its board and John Hess relinquish his chairmanship -- a heavy price to pay for the dynasty's survival.
""Many people would say, 'Oh, well, they won't want to sell their business because that's the Hess name, it's the Hess company,'"" Marc Lipschultz, a director on the company's board, said of Hess's deal with Chevron. ""He said, 'OK, it's the right strategic thing to do.'""
John Hess told employees last week that the merger would allow Hess to combine its growing oil resources with Chevron's sturdy balance sheet and diverse assets.
""My father always believed that there was something noble about a business that could create jobs for people,"" he said during a companywide meeting. ""I just want you to know a lot of thought has gone into this.""
Similar to the Rockefellers, the Hesses suffered near-fatal business wounds over the years and decided to spin off their prized retail segment. But they maintained a 9.5% stake in the company, the value of which has soared to more than $4 billion -- close to double what it was a decade ago.
The family's influence radiated from the East Coast, where around Christmastime loyal fans lined up at Hess gas stations to buy the company-branded toy trucks. The toys are held in special reverence by the family: John Hess is personally involved in the design of each new model, as his father was.
By age 7, John Hess was being groomed for succession, accompanying his father to foreign oil outposts. During that period, Leon Hess built what became the world's largest refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands and merged the business with Amerada Petroleum to form Amerada Hess.
The elder Hess wildcatted in search of oil from Alaska to the North Sea, rubbing shoulders with heads of state as he built his empire. To a guest visiting his art-filled Manhattan apartment, he reportedly once showed a Rolodex card with the phone number of Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini on it.
A press-shy businessman, Leon Hess became a celebrity to New Yorkers as the owner of the Jets. He became a partial owner of the football team in 1963 before buying it outright in 1984. Despite the franchise's years of mediocrity, his devotion remained intact. On Thanksgiving Day, the tycoon would attend practice in a folding chair, wearing a knitted green Jets hat.
In 1995, 40-year-old John Hess took over as CEO. He had learned the business from the ground up, pumping gas at 16 and joining the board in his early 20s. He studied at Harvard, where he was eager to learn about oil and geopolitics, said Daniel Yergin, the vice chairman of S&P Global, who met him during a seminar on Middle Eastern oil there.
""He wasn't ghosting through, he was there to learn about this stuff,"" said Yergin, an energy historian. Years later, Yergin would attend energy conferences alongside the oilman and watch as he conversed with Middle Eastern ministers in Arabic, which Hess speaks fluently.
Under John Hess's leadership, the company forayed into new offshore frontiers and started drilling into shale-rock formations in North Dakota. But it suffered some costly misses in Indonesia, Brazil and Texas, and analysts said the company was spreading itself thin. Hess's lagging share price gave an opening to activist investor Elliott Management.
After Elliott's intervention in 2013, Hess shed more than $10 billion worth of assets -- including its gas stations -- to raise cash and become a nimbler player focused on a few large oil-and-gas projects, such as North Dakota's Bakken Shale.
John Hess got a reprieve in 2015, when Exxon announced an oil discovery off the shores of Guyana, in South America. Hess had staked a 30% interest in the exploration project, which was later estimated to hold about 11 billion barrels of oil and gas, the largest modern oil find.
But the share price languished and Elliott came charging back in 2017, saying the company should get leaner and buy back more stock. It sought to oust John Hess, saying he had amassed a two-decade record of middling performance. Hess headed off a potentially mortal proxy fight when the company agreed to purchase additional shares.
In the years since, the company's stock skyrocketed as Guyana has taken off, vindicating the CEO's strategy to funnel cash from its Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia assets to grow in the Bakken and develop the offshore enterprise. Hess's stock hit a record around $166 in the days before the deal.
John Hess had previously discussed a potential tie-up with Chevron CEO Mike Wirth, but Hess's valuation wasn't high enough for a deal to happen, people close to him said. Talks picked up pace in the last six months, leading to an agreement for Chevron to buy Hess for $171 a share based on Chevron's closing price the Friday of the previous week. John Hess will join Chevron's board.
""The activist attacks by Elliott, if they had been successful, would have left shareholders with far less than they're getting in the Chevron transaction,"" said Martin Lipton, a founding partner of law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and a longtime Hess adviser.
Elliott Management declined to comment.
On his desk, Lipton keeps a version of the first toy truck made by Hess and last year's model. The dynasty may disappear, but fans will be able to keep collecting the toys. ""The tradition will continue,"" John Hess said in an interview this week. ""In fact, next year is the 60th anniversary. I already know what the model is, but I can't tell you.""

On the heels of competing megadeals, Exxon Mobil and Chevron reported a combined $15.6 billion in profits Friday as oil and fuel prices climbed in the third quarter.
Exxon's quarterly earnings of $9.1 billion were less than half of last year's quarterly record but rose 15% from the previous quarter. Margins for making fuel widened and the company's oil refineries produced more than any third quarter since 1999.
Chevron said it banked $6.5 billion in third-quarter earnings, up 8.5% from the previous quarter, though it sank from $11.2 billion in the same period last year.
Now, both companies must turn to the task of closing their deals, worth more than a combined $110 billion. Exxon expects its $59.5 billion all-stock agreement to buy shale giant Pioneer Natural Resources to close in the first half of next year, as does Chevron with its deal to purchase Hess for $53 billion in stock, announced Monday.
Exxon shares were down almost 2% to $105.55 at the close of trading Friday, and Chevron's stock fell 6.7% to $144.35. Both Exxon and Chevron missed analysts' quarterly earnings-per-share estimates, according to FactSet.
The Pioneer deal, announced earlier this month, won the full backing of Exxon's board, including the three directors who joined following a successful activist investor's campaign in 2021. It hands a victory to Chief Executive Darren Woods, who made a big gamble that demand for oil will stay healthy for decades even as many countries seek a transition to green energy.
Earlier this year, Exxon agreed to a nearly $5 billion deal to buy Denbury, a U.S. oil company that operates carbon-dioxide pipelines, which Exxon says demonstrates its commitment to lower-carbon energy.
""The whole strategy is around making sure that we have the best portfolio and the most resilient portfolio so that we can basically be successful irrespective of commodity price,"" Woods said in a conference call with analysts Friday.
Exxon and Chevron also have to figure out how to integrate their new acquisitions into sprawling global organizations, combining companies with vastly different corporate cultures and strategies.
Exxon executives are already mingling with Pioneer staff in Midland, Texas, and the Dallas area, to learn how the shale driller has kept operations lean in recent years while operating over a vast swath of the Permian Basin's most lucrative acreage. Exxon has said it plans to retain many Pioneer employees.
Some on Wall Street aren't sold on the transaction.
Exxon executives have been met with skepticism from investors who questioned some of the company's key claims about the deal. Investors and analysts said they have seen little evidence Exxon is making the technological strides needed to wring an average of $2 billion a year of synergies the company has promised to collect from its tie-up.
Woods has promised investors the company can ultimately double the amount of oil it recovers from shale wells -- long considered a holy grail in the oil patch -- delivering more than half of the synergies.
Doing that will depend on whether Exxon is able to achieve through its scientific research what Pioneer and the cohort of smaller producers haven't through more than a decade of trial and error.
Kathy Mikells, Exxon's finance chief, said in an interview its estimate for $2 billion in synergies is based on proven techniques and technologies Exxon is already using, and that it believes research investments in oil-field data and chemical cocktails used in fracking will bring further upside to its earnings, ultimately.
""This is a deal driven by enhancing resource recovery that provides better energy security for the country,"" she said.
Chevron's deal to buy Hess carries risk, as well. Hess owns a 30% stake in an Exxon-led offshore oil project in Guyana, the biggest prize in the transaction. Offshore projects take years to develop, and the ocean operations are more complex, costly and riskier than onshore drilling.
It would take years longer to fully play out compared with Exxon's investment in Pioneer, a nimble shale operator that can pump oil from wells much more quickly, investors said. That is why San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron's agreement to purchase Hess is a bet on the truly long-term future of oil. But many investors aren't convinced demand for oil will hold up as well as Exxon and Chevron have predicted.
Pierre Breber, Chevron's finance chief, said it expects new platforms coming online off Guyana will double the company's free cash flow by 2027, enabling it to boost dividends and share buybacks. He said in meetings with investors, many seem to understand how Hess would fit into Chevron's strategy.
""You get a wide range of views with investors, just like any group, but the consensus I think is that the transaction makes a lot of sense for both companies,"" he said.
Exxon is no stranger to criticism when it comes to its oil-and-gas deals.
In 2010, it bought shale company XTO Energy for more than $30 billion. The deal is widely considered an ill-timed disaster. The company had been late to invest in the shale boom, and went all-in just before natural-gas prices tanked because of surging shale supplies.
Investors said, though, that the Pioneer deal is far more attractive than the XTO deal ever was, because of the quality of the assets and superior management.
Wall Street in recent years soured on U.S. oil companies after a long stretch of lackluster results. Exxon's and Chevron's deals haven't made them more attractive to investors, according to Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Houston-based Pickering Energy Partners. He said the institutional investors fear that oil demand could be a problem, or that oil prices have more downside risk.
""Institutional investors are still skeptical that the oil patch is where they really want to get bigger,"" he said."

As the world becomes more dangerous, the two largest Western crude producers are focusing their investments closer to home.
Chevron on Monday said that it was acquiring Hess in a $53 billion deal that gives it access to one of this century's biggest oil finds in the South American country of Guyana and allows it to double down on shale by expanding its presence to North Dakota. Both regions are established oil producers with limited geopolitical tensions, affording Chevron new reserves with fewer risks.
The deal follows a megadeal in the U.S. shale patch by Exxon Mobil, which this month acquired Pioneer Natural Resources in a $60 billion merger that anchors its future to the prolific Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.
The back-to-back acquisitions signal that the oil majors are increasingly turning their attention to the Western Hemisphere as international investments are complicated by the threat of expanding regional conflicts, from Ukraine to the Middle East.
In a call with analysts to discuss the Pioneer deal earlier this month, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said that diversification allowed the company to manage geopolitical risks but that Exxon also had to make sure that it had access to low-cost production, including in the U.S.
Chevron's announcement was made two weeks after Israel ordered the company to shut down natural-gas production at one of its two major offshore platforms in the Eastern Mediterranean as the war between Israel and Hamas escalated.
The order was a reminder of the risks oil majors face in a region marred by violence that has previously jeopardized ambitious energy projects.
The companies also face investors' demands that they focus on returns and steer away from the potentially profitable but costly and risky frontier exploration of untested regions that vaulted them to their global status.
""The age of frontier basin, breakthrough basin exploration may be done,"" said Raoul LeBlanc, an analyst at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
Exxon and Chevron built their businesses for decades by scouring the globe for exploration opportunities as investors pressured the companies to add to their booked reserves, a key metric used by shareholders to value the producers.
As a result, oil giants operated in far-flung locales rife with what is known in industry parlance as aboveground risk.
The emergence of U.S. shale eased some of the pressure as companies were able to drill in their own backyards, where frackers didn't have to worry about wars or sudden regime changes.
In recent years, large Western oil companies have packed up and left places such as Southeast Asia, West Africa, Russia and parts of Latin America.
Exxon has planned since 2018 to sell at least $15 billion worth of assets as it shrinks its global footprint and focuses on its more valuable assets. It has sold out of projects in Chad and Cameroon and made progress on its goal to shed additional holdings in Iraq and Nigeria.
The company pulled out of Russia, where it had spent years establishing a foothold, once cultivating ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin wiped out Exxon's stake in a major oil-and-gas project there after the company tried to exit from the venture following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Chevron since 2019 has unloaded assets in Azerbaijan, Denmark, the U.K. and Brazil, among other places.
As the companies have retreated, their overall production volumes have shrunk. Exxon produced about 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year, down about 17% from 2011, its annual peak. Chevron's international output fell 3% last year after concessions in Thailand and Indonesia expired.
Following the Pioneer deal, about 45% of Exxon's production will come from the U.S., up from roughly 31% before it, according to JPMorgan Chase.
Both Exxon and Chevron said their recent shale acquisitions would strengthen U.S. energy security, reflecting concerns that oil supplies may become harder to come by as war rages in Ukraine and diplomats rush to the Middle East to try to prevent a regional conflagration involving Israel and Iran-backed forces.
Guyana's proximity to the U.S. and relatively stable politics are similarly appealing to the oil companies. The country has exhibited respect for contracts for oil concessions there, allowing Exxon and Chevron to tout their investments as low-risk projects that will deliver new oil barrels to the U.S., potentially lowering gasoline prices, analysts said.
""This gives you, as majors, an important foothold in regions that are also of strategic importance for the U.S.,"" Carolyn Kissane, a clinical professor at New York University's Center for Global Affairs, said of the recent deals.
President Biden ran on a platform to stop new oil production but encouraged companies to drill more after the war began in Ukraine, which pushed gasoline to record levels.
Earlier this year, he approved ConocoPhillips's massive Willow oil-and-gas project in the U.S. Arctic. The decision angered environmentalists but sent a signal to producers that the administration likely wouldn't skewer them for making fossil fuel investments close to home.
Chevron and Exxon have played down concerns that U.S. antitrust regulators would block either deal, saying the tie-ups will benefit consumers by ensuring domestic energy supplies.
Exxon and its partners, Hess and China's Cnooc, have revved up Guyana's oil production from nothing in 2019 to 400,000 barrels a day. The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments.
Hess owns a share of nearly one-third in the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and gas found off the shores of Guyana.
By acquiring Hess, Chevron also gains a foothold in North Dakota's Bakken Shale, a mature basin where relatively few investments are required to maintain production, said S&P's LeBlanc. Hess produced 181,000 barrels of oil and gas a day in the region in the second quarter of the year."

| Jump to first hitChevron Corporation, the second largest oil company based in the United States is making a comeback in the Indian lubricants market after 12 years.
Chevron Brands International LLC (Chevron), a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation and state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have entered into a 10-year long-term agreement to license, produce, distribute, and market Chevron's lubricant products under the Caltex brand. The companies officially launched the Caltex brand in the Indian market on Wednesday.
HPCL's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility at Silvassa will manufacture Caltex lubricants. The plant has the capacity to produce 75 TKLPA of lubricating oils.
""We see India as a strategic growth market and from a lubricants perspective, the growth in terms of industrial and commercial vehicles, is very significant, especially when you think about globally, in some parts of the world demand is going down. Here, demand will continue to increase. So, we wanted to be in this market,"" said Danielle Lincoln, Vice President of Chevron International Products.
Lincoln added that Caltex has not been in India since 2011.
""Like any other company, we assessed our portfolio and made a decision that we could use the resources in different places. So we left the (Indian) market. But now we're coming back through this partnership model,"" Lincoln said, adding that the company has a similar model in different parts of the world-- in South Africa and in parts of Europe, in Turkey, and in South America. ""So we know how to do this model and we have seen it to be very effective.""
Chevron is a global marketer of finished lubricants with 10 facilities and 25 blending plants around the world. Through the agreement, Chevron's proprietary Havoline and Delo-branded lubes will be sold in India.
Lincoln added that along with HPCL the company will identify and launch new products in the market. Currently, Caltex supplies lubes for personal as well as commercial vehicles and and industrial machinery.
The companies would also be launching appropriate products for the EV industry going forward.
The Indian lubricant market is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world and the third largest in terms of consumption.
The lubricants market has around 1000 players in India. Around 40 companies are dominant in the market. HPCL commands a 17% share in the market.
""I don't see any conflict between the two (HPCL and Caltex). With this partnership, we will be able to cater to the entire spectrum of needs of the customer,"" said Amit Garg, Director - Marketing, HPCL.
HPCL is in the process of carving out a separate subsidiary for its lubes business and is exploring further options of demerging or listing it.
HPCL's annual report said, in the lubricant segment it has achieved the highest ever sales to countries in the Middle East region and Africa via its Dubai-based 100% subsidiary.
HPCL Middle East FZCO (HMEF), a wholly owned subsidiary of HPCL, markets lubricants and other petroleum products across various markets in the Middle East and Africa."

Chevron said it would buy Hess in an all-stock deal worth $53 billion in the second major oil tie-up this month, after Exxon Mobil's deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources.
The U.S. energy company said buying Hess would upgrade and diversify its portfolio, marking Chevron's entrance into an Exxon-led partnership overseeing a generational oil find in Guyana, while picking up additional U.S. shale assets largely in North Dakota.
The transaction, less than two weeks after Exxon's acquisition of Pioneer, shows the U.S.'s second-largest oil company is similarly tying its future to a bet that the world will continue to have an appetite for oil for decades, even as many countries are seeking to cut emissions and transition toward green energy.
The major oil companies' doubling down on fossil fuels follows a recent prediction by the International Energy Agency that fossil-fuel demand globally would reach its zenith this decade.
""These are two great American companies coming together to be even stronger at a time when investment in American energy is important from the standpoint of jobs and from the standpoint of energy security,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview on Monday.
The deal values Hess at $171 a share based on Chevron's closing price on Friday, with Hess shareholders receiving 1.025 shares of Chevron for each Hess share. The price represents a premium of 4.9% from Hess's closing share price on Friday and 10.3% when compared with the stock's 20-day average price.
Hess shares closed down about 1% to $161.30 on Monday, while Chevron shares fell 3.7% to $160.68. Including debt, the transaction has a total enterprise value of $60 billion.
The deal comes as oil-and-gas companies are flush with cash after energy prices rocketed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with executives signaling they were ready to deploy their war chests at the deals table.
Hess has been led for decades by Chief Executive John Hess, who -- along with a few other shale executives -- has made the public case for bolstering domestic energy supplies. Hess is expected to join Chevron's board, Chevron said.
Hess, who owns about 9% of the eponymous company, led it to scoop up a large position early on in the American shale revolution, primarily in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota.
The biggest prize for Chevron is Hess's nearly one-third share of the estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and gas found off the shores of Guyana. Exxon and its partners, Hess and China's Cnooc, have revved up Guyana's oil production from nothing in 2019 to 400,000 barrels a day.
The partners expect to be pumping 1.2 million barrels a day by 2027, making it one of the world's fastest-ever oil developments. By then, the former British colony will be the source of $180 billion in market value for the consortium, some analysts have said.
Exxon Mobil earlier this month struck a nearly $60 billion agreement to buy Pioneer Natural Resources in the largest oil-and-gas deal in two decades. Both Exxon and Chevron have also agreed on smaller transactions earlier this year.
On Monday, Wirth said the deal for Hess would position his company to strengthen its long-term performance and further enhance its portfolio. The combination is also expected to achieve cost synergies of around $1 billion before taxes within a year of closing, the company said. Wirth said the combined company should have an inventory of lucrative drilling locations into the next decade.
Wirth has become a vocal defender of the U.S. oil industry as fossil-fuel producers have come under scrutiny of the Biden administration, environmental groups and European governments for their contribution to climate change.
""I don't think this would in any way be read as not being supportive of a lower carbon future, but it also recognizes the reality that oil and gas are important today and will be for many, many years to come,"" Wirth said in the interview.
Mark van Baal, founder of Follow This, a climate-focused investment group, said Chevron's deal runs counter to the Paris climate agreement and that investors must exert more pressure on oil companies to reduce production.
Chevron's board of directors has said it would waive the company's fixed retirement age to allow Wirth to remain CEO for a longer period as it weighs its C-suite strategy. Wirth became CEO in 2018, when the company was reeling from years of cost overruns made more acute by an oil-market crash in 2015 and anemic energy prices. He was seen as an executive who could corral runaway costs.
In 2019, Wirth refused to enter into a bidding war when Occidental Petroleum swooped in to buy Anadarko Petroleum for billions more than Chevron had offered. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee and bought Noble Energy for a lower price the next year, a deal that gave the company access to Middle East natural-gas markets and a bigger U.S. footprint.
Wirth has touted his strategy since walking away from Anadarko to focus on acquisitions that offered low premiums to its targets, including its agreement in May to buy PDC Energy for more than $6 billion. Chevron's deal to buy Hess is its third since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 with a premium of around 10%, Chevron said.
Wirth said he expects Chevron will make a double-digit return on capital employed, a measure closely watched by investors, at midrange oil prices and would be prepared for an oil downturn, should one occur. Echoing other oil executives and analysts, Wirth said it is time that companies scale up via mergers and acquisitions.
""Ours is an industry, particularly as you get into the shale patch, that was due for some consolidation,"" Wirth said on a call with investors on Monday.
Chevron said it expected the Hess deal, which needs a green light from Hess shareholders as well as regulatory approvals, to close in the first half of 2024."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
The smell of mergers and acquisitions is in the air after more than $110 billion of oil megadeals this month -- Chevron's agreement to buy Hess and Exxon Mobil's deal for Pioneer Natural Resources.
Devon Energy is said to be eyeing targets that include Marathon Oil and CrownRock, according to a report from Bloomberg. Gas producer Chesapeake Energy is reportedly considering an acquisition of Southwestern Energy, according to Reuters.
Between the declining pool of quality shale inventory and the limited number of sizable targets in the Permian Basin, energy companies could soon be forced into deal-making action.
The fear-of-missing-out ""component of it is only going to accelerate. See one or two more deals, and there could be a scarcity premium that starts to emerge,"" said Dan Pickering, chief investment officer at Pickering Energy Partners.
Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy and Diamondback Energy are among the largest producers in the Permian, according to data from Enverus, and are large enough that they could be a potential target or an acquirer, according to Pickering. All three have estimated resource lives of roughly 30 years or more, according to an analysis from Goldman Sachs.
While EOG Resources is one of the top producers there, the company has been more interested in asset acquisitions rather than corporate deals, Pickering added. Smaller Permian producers, those with sub-$10-billion market capitalizations, include Matador Resources and Permian Resources, which agreed to acquire Earthstone Energy in August.
ConocoPhillips could be another acquirer. Given major European oil companies' lagging valuations and the pressure they face to decarbonize, they seem less likely to throw their hats into the ring.
The market was ripe for consolidation. In a white paper published in June, energy asset manager Kimmeridge noted there are ""too many public companies relative to the degree of investor interest"" for U.S. oil and gas producers. In its analysis of filings for the five largest active fund managers (including Fidelity and J.P. Morgan), it found those managers' holdings of the five largest energy companies in the S&P 500 expanded from 40% to 53% of U.S. energy holdings in the second quarter of 2023, compared with the same period five years earlier. At the same time, holdings of smaller energy companies declined.
The valuation gap between the energy giants and the smaller producers has widened. An index that is heavily weighted toward Exxon Mobil, Chevron and other large producers commands a valuation, measured as enterprise value as a multiple of forward-12-month Ebitda, that is 44% higher than an index tracking smaller producers. The premium averaged 14% over the past 17 years and, at the peak of optimism about the shale patch, there was a time when small, fast-growing frackers were valued more highly than larger, less nimble peers.
There is reason to think the wave of deal-making might not be fast and furious. Kimmeridge portfolio manager Mark Viviano argued that, in many cases, entrenched executives and boards at potential target companies don't have an incentive to green light deals. In a previous report, Kimmeridge noted most chief executives of exploration and production companies own very little stock directly and their skills typically aren't transferable outside the industry, making exits undesirable.
The Exxon Mobil-Pioneer deal ""was headline grabbing and I'm hoping it serves as a catalyst, but I'm naturally skeptical,"" Viviano said.
Betting on the next target is tricky, but the trend of consolidation should be bullish for energy-sector investors. While Exxon Mobil signaled the combination with Pioneer will result in more production than if the companies had remained independent, other consolidations over the past 18 months have involved a reduction in rig count, according to Robert Clarke, vice president of upstream research at Wood Mackenzie. As long as future consolidations result in more reductions, it should be supportive for commodity prices and returns.
The growth FOMO that plagued drillers during the shale boom was unhealthy. Consolidation FOMO is one investors can applaud."

The climate lobby's pronouncements that the end of fossil fuels is nigh appear as premature as warnings two decades ago that supply would soon run out. Chevron on Monday announced a $53 billion bid for Hess Corp. because it knows the world will need oil and gas for the foreseeable future no matter how much politicians subsidize green energy.
Chevron's Hess acquisition comes on the heels of Exxon Mobil's $60 billion tie-up with Pioneer National Resources this month. Higher interest rates are prompting consolidation across the U.S. economy, as smaller, less-capitalized companies struggle to borrow. Oil and gas giants are flush with cash owing to the run-up in prices over the past two years.
As he tried to deflect blame for high gasoline prices last year, President Biden demanded that oil and gas companies spend their record profits on increasing production. That's what they're doing. Chevron says the combined company is ""expected to grow production and free cash flow faster and for longer"" than its current five-year guidance.
Hess will increase Chevron's footprint in the Gulf of Mexico and North Dakota's Bakken shale formation. Texas's Permian basin accounts for almost all of the U.S. oil supply growth over the past three years, but its production is expected to start tapering off by the end of this decade. Hess's Bakken assets could then become more valuable.
But Hess's most lucrative real estate may be off the coast of Guyana, where it holds a 30% share in an estimated 11 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources, which it is developing with Exxon and China's Cnooc. That play currently produces 400,000 barrels a day and is expected to ""deliver production growth into the next decade,"" according to Chevron.
If Chevron believed that demand for hydrocarbons would soon peak and decline -- as the International Energy Agency (IEA) claimed last month -- it instead could have boosted investment in heavily subsidized green-energy ventures such as hydrogen or increased shareholder buybacks.
But oil and gas are yielding a higher return on capital than renewables, even with government's enormous green subsidies. This is why BP and Shell are scaling back wind and solar investment and sinking more capital into fossil fuels. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth says the company will make a double-digit return on capital.
Offshore wind projects around the world are being scrapped because they aren't expected to be profitable amid higher interest rates and material costs. Ford and General Motors are putting their electric-vehicle manufacturing plans in neutral amid slowing consumer demand. Tesla also recently dialed back plans to expand production.
Demand for green energy and EVs could peak sooner than demand for fossil fuels. Population and energy demand are growing mostly in low-income countries. Nigerians aren't going to drive Teslas or power their homes with solar panels. High costs and technological challenges also limit the widespread deployment of green energy and EVs in wealthy countries.
The climate lobby still isn't paying attention. The IEA last month proclaimed that the world is witnessing ""the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era."" Green activists are demanding that companies disclose their ""climate risks."" The real threat to a more prosperous future, as Chevron well knows, is a world with too little oil and gas, not too much."

| Jump to first hitEuropean natural gas prices are in a volatile state due to growing concerns whether or not there will be enough supply over the winer, after the crisis in Israel and Gaza and Chevron's operations in Australia are casting a long shadow over the market outlook.European natural gas benchmark Dutch TTF's price soared 41% to an eight-month high of 56 per megawatt-hour last week. The price has gone up more than 50% in a month, however, it is still less than half of the price one year ago. Global uncertainties are fuelling the increase, after US oil giant Chevron Corp stopped production at its offshore Tamar natural gas field near Israel's northern coast, as the Israeli-Hamas conflict intensifies.Why shutting down an Israeli gas field could matter for Europe?The Tamar field is believed to hold more than 300 billion cubic metres of gas, which is the equivalent of the annual European natural gas imports. The field provides 70% of Israel's energy needs for power generation, according to Chevron. A lengthy shutdown would result in a drop in Israeli gas exports to its neighbours, including Egypt, which itself, provides gas export to the European market. This year, Egypt's exports are expected to be 7.5 million tonnes, with the majority destined for Europe and Turkey. The country has planned to resume liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports this month.More bad news are squeezing the market from across the globeMeanwhile, workers at Chevron Corp's liquefied natural gas facilities in Australia reaffirmed their plan to resume strikes this week while the talks continue. An in-principle deal that ended weeks of strikes in September fell apart earlier this month after unions said Chevron had reneged on commitments and vowed to resume strikes at the Gorgon and Wheatstone sites, which supply around 6% of the world's LNG.European gas prices also jumped following news that the Balticconnector offshore gas pipeline was damaged between Finland and Estonia. The leak resulted in a temporary closure of the pipeline, the repair works could take several months.Should Europe worry about gas supplies?The reassuring thing is that gas storage across Europe is at more than 90% capacity, including a large amount of gas inherited from the winter of 2022/23. There are also additional volumes being stockpiled in Ukrainian storage facilities.There is also a high probability, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, that Europe will have a very mild winter, potentially reducing the demand for heating fuels. However, as sabotage is suspected of being behind the Balticconnector pipeline leak, concerns have been raised over the vulnerability of European pipeline infrastructure.And even though the EU is not likely to battle any substantial supply difficulties this winter, the ongoing impact of global gas disruption is going to keep the prices high - a cost that households and businesses will have to shoulder eventually.Source: Euronews"

Israel has ordered Chevron to shut down natural-gas production at one of the two major offshore platforms it operates in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, the oil company said Monday.
The closing of the Tamar platform is expected to make only a small dent in Chevron's profits, offset by a surge in oil prices since the fighting began over the weekend. But it highlights the risks for the U.S. oil major that has been striving to make more inroads in the gas-rich region, which has long been troubled by conflicts that have delayed energy investments.
Chevron inherited operatorship of Israel's Tamar and Leviathan gas fields in its $5 billion purchase of Noble Energy in 2020, and has worked to expand into Egypt and Cyprus.
It is weighing using underused plants in Egypt or floating facilities to liquefy more of the leftover gas Israel doesn't use and ship it to European markets while supplies from Russia languish at low levels. Regional unrest could complicate or slow its various investment plans, analysts said.
""It implicitly assumes there's a gradual movement toward peace in the region,"" said Ed Chow, a former Chevron executive and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington. ""Now that's in jeopardy.""
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth recently told investors the company is working to tie together gas-producing assets and an exploration play to create a competitive advantage in the region. It is expanding and optimizing its Israeli gas platforms, and recently found sufficient gas in an appraisal well off Cyprus.
But if Chevron finds difficulties marketing Israel's natural gas to neighboring countries or loses access to liquefaction facilities in Egypt, it could slow further investments there, said Jim Krane, an energy specialist at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston. ""Right now, we have no idea where this conflict is going,"" Krane said. ""That would call for some circumspection and call for some pause on investment.""
The Tamar platform is about 15 miles off Ashkelon, an Israeli coastal city, and within range of rockets fired from Gaza. Israel's energy ministry said it could rely on alternative fuels.
The Leviathan platform, the other major offshore gas facility Chevron operates, continues to send gas to Israel and elsewhere for export, the company said.
""Chevron is focused on the safe and reliable supply of natural gas for the benefit of the Israeli domestic market and our regional customers,"" the company said.
If the conflict persists for long, the loss of the Tamar field would slow Chevron's efforts to expand exports from Egypt into Europe, analysts said. It had hoped to increase shipments
The disruption of Russian gas supplies to Europe gave Chevron and others including Exxon Mobil and ENI an opening to develop gas fields in the Eastern Mediterranean and countries such as Algeria. Chevron and Exxon have tried to negotiate deals to drill in Algeria's gas-rich fields, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Chevron's Tamar platform typically produces about 1 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas into Israel's domestic market and elsewhere for exports. The figure is a fraction of the world's natural-gas market, says Andy Lipow, an oil and gas analyst in Houston. It is also about half the size of the Freeport LNG export terminal in the Gulf Coast, which went offline for months after an explosion at the plant last year. The outage sent domestic prices hurtling down because it removed an outlet for U.S. shale gas."

SYDNEY -- Workers at two natural-gas facilities operated by Chevron in Australia have voted to restart industrial action, reigniting a dispute that has rattled global energy markets.
The Offshore Alliance, a partnership between two local unions, said the decision was taken at mass meetings of members on Thursday and Friday.
It alleged Chevron had attempted to walk back on an agreement recommended by Australia's workplace arbiter around two weeks ago.
Australia rivals Qatar as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Chevron's Gorgon and Wheatstone liquefied-natural-gas facilities in Australia, at the center of the labor dispute, account for roughly 7% of global supply.
Analysts say disruptions to production from the sites could result in more competition for spot LNG cargoes, with some shipments typically destined for Europe -- including from the U.S. -- likely to be diverted to Asia. European countries have become more reliant on the supercooled fuel since Russia cut off most of the gas it used to pump to the continent.
Benchmark European natural-gas prices gained slightly more than 2% in Friday morning trading in London.
A spokesman for Chevron in Australia said the company was continuing to work with all parties to finalize the agreements.
The Chevron workers initially began industrial action on Sept. 8 after negotiations with the U.S. energy company didn't conclude with an agreement on issues such as pay. Within days, Chevron asked Australia's Fair Work Commission to intervene to resolve the dispute.
On Sept. 21, Chevron and representatives for the disaffected workers agreed to a deal recommended by the commission, ending the threat of strikes.
On Friday, the Offshore Alliance said it had been working with Chevron to finalize the drafting of those agreements. However, it said lawyers acting for Chevron had attempted to walk back some of the clauses that it believed had been settled.
""The Offshore Alliance has written to the Fair Work Commission to apply to have the matter relisted,"" said Brad Gandy, the alliance's spokesperson. ""This ensures workplace issues already agreed to won't be lost due to Chevron's recent poor behavior."""

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Sept. 10 -- Government high-ups have requested American energy giant Chevron to continue gas production from its three onshore fields uninterruptedly amid overdue payments piling up for fund constraints, sources say.Chevron Bangladesh company has backtracked on its hard line for now and continues production.The development comes following recent discussions of the finance minister and the central bank governor with top officials of Chevron to pacify it to continue operations, the sources said.Since then, state corporation Petrobangla has increased payment, slightly though, to Chevron against its outstanding gas bills.Months ago, sources said, the local chapter of the US-based international oil company or IOC had requested Petrobangla in a letter to clear all its payment arrears, amounting to $280.72 million, by a cutoff time of 31 August 2023.Later, the Petrobangla chairman apprised the energy secretary of the matter and requested the Bangladesh Bank and other relevant commercial banks to provide necessary dollars to clear dues for the sake of uninterrupted gas supply.Petrobangla apprehended an impending disaster in the country's overall gas supply from the Chevron-operated largest gas fields due to unpaid bills that kept mounting since April 2022, said sources.Petrobangla owes more than $280 million for gas purchase from the US oil major.Bangladesh could not clear payments to Chevron for over a year, from April 2022 to May 2023, amid dollar crunch, with the prospect of supply disruption from its largest producer, according to sources.As per the gas purchase and sales agreement (GPSA) between Chevron and Petrobangla, the company has the liberty to halt production if non-payment exceeds a five-month period, says an official.According to article 14.3 of the GPSA, the seller shall not be obligated to supply any gas to the buyer if the buyer's payment is over five-month late from when payment is due.""In this event, the seller shall have the right to defer delivery of gas without violating this Agreement or the PSC until all unpaid payments for the gas delivered to the buyer which are three (03) months' overdue are cleared.""Petrobangla chairman Zanendra Nath Sarker has said the corporation is trying for arranging funds and making payment. ""Petrobangla is trying to clear all the dues to Chevron as soon as possible.""He adds: ""On a couple of occasions recently, we have discussed with the central bank the matter of facilitating payment to Chevron.""Mr Sarker said Bangladesh never before defaulted on paying Chevron gas bills. ""Bangladesh used to make payment within one month of getting natural gas supplied into its national gas grid.""Chevron produces 1,280 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd), accounting for around 60 per cent of the total output from local gas fields, according to Petrobangla's reckonings on September 09.The US hydrocarbon explorer has three operating onshore fields - Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulvibazar - located in blocks 12, 13 and 14 respectively.Bangladesh's overall natural gas output is currently hovering around 2,879mmcfd, including 749mmcfd regasified LNG, further reveal Petrobangla data.Even with gas bills ballooning, Chevron started drilling the 27th well in the country's largest-producing Bibiyana gas field weeks ago.The gas field under block 12 in north-eastern Habiganj district is currently producing around 1,089mmcfd gas, which accounts for over half the total output from local gas fields.Chevron Bangladesh has planned to drill several gas wells in the newly obtained 'flank' area if the Bibiyana-27 well drilling comes out successful.Last year, the US oil major obtained a 60-square-kilometre 'flank' area outside its existing contract zone to the north of Bibiyana to carry out exploration afresh, as Bangladesh's fuel demand remains insatiate and the government takes recourse to import of expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to feed industries and households.[email protected]Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
One reminder from the latest results from Exxon Mobil and Chevron is that the oil and gas business is highly cyclical. Another important takeaway: Their cash payouts aren't.
Exxon Mobil said Friday that net income was $7.9 billion in the second quarter, a 56% decline from a year earlier when both oil and natural-gas prices surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chevron, which prereleased some of its results on Sunday, earned $6 billion in the second quarter -- about half of what it made a year earlier.
Brent crude futures averaged about $78 a barrel in the second quarter, down roughly a third from a year earlier, while U.S. benchmark natural-gas prices declined by more than 50% over the same period. Refining margins have fallen, too, as concerns about Russia's supply moderated. Despite declining profits, though, the two U.S. oil majors collectively paid shareholders $15.2 billion in the quarter through dividends and share repurchases -- in line with what they distributed a year ago when free cash flow was 3.7 times higher. Both Exxon and Chevron made acquisitions as well, which limits their ability to repurchase shares before the deals close. But the companies on Friday reiterated that they each still plan on meeting their $17.5 billion buyback targets this year.
The Permian Basin continued to be a bright spot for the two majors: Chevron said Permian production of oil and natural gas in barrels of oil equivalent reached record highs, up 11%, helping the company beat upstream earnings expectations by a healthy 10%. Exxon said production in the Permian and Guyana grew a combined 20% compared with the prior-year quarter. The company said some of its asset divestments and its exit from Russia's Sakhalin-1 project hit earnings, as did some government-mandated curtailments.
Oil prices have recovered about 11% since the end of the second quarter, and the International Energy Agency forecast in its latest report that oil demand is set to outpace supply in the second half of this year.
Trying to predict where energy commodity prices will go is a highly speculative exercise. But investors might take comfort in knowing that it will likely take something even more dramatic than the 2020 pandemic-induced oil-demand plunge to stop the U.S. oil majors from distributing cash. Exxon and Chevron's collective quarterly payouts -- dividends plus share repurchases -- have never dropped below $5 billion over the past decade, including the second quarter of 2020, when Brent crude averaged less than $30 a barrel.
Moreover, the two companies have become leaner, meaner machines, which means even middling commodity prices should translate to decent profits. Their earnings have roughly doubled compared with the second quarter of 2018, when oil and gas prices roughly mirrored this past quarter. And while cash balances are no longer at their record highs, Exxon and Chevron hold $29.6 billion and $9.6 billion worth of cash on their balance sheets, respectively -- enough to keep funding generous payouts while remaining able to pounce on acquisition opportunities.
Investors who held on to U.S. oil majors through the most recent cycle have been rewarded handsomely. Between share-price appreciation and dividend payouts, Exxon and Chevron have returned 85% and 57%, respectively, since the beginning of 2020, compared with the S&P 500's 50% return. Both stocks have declined year to date and their valuations remain cheap relative to historical averages: Exxon's enterprise value as a multiple of forward earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is about 18% below the 10-year average and Chevron's is 7% cheaper on the same basis.
In an uncertain world, the stalwarts of a notoriously cyclical industry look surprisingly steady."

Chevron deepened its commitment to oil-and-gas drilling in the U.S., spending more than $6 billion to acquire a rival with sizable operations in Texas and Colorado.
In buying PDC Energy in a $6.3 billion all-stock deal, the U.S. oil company aims to build a bigger foothold in two prolific oil patches, particularly the Denver-Julesburg Basin that straddles Colorado and Wyoming, a region where Chevron already has a large stake.
The transaction also boosts Chevron's position in its major U.S. onshore play, the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the most prolific American oil patch but one where Chevron and many other companies have seen well-productivity issues over the past year.
Chevron said it would issue 0.4638 share, valued at $72 based on Friday's closing price of $155.23, for each share of Denver-based PDC. It equates to a nearly 11% premium to Friday's closing price of $65.12.
Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., said the deal has a total enterprise value of $7.6 billion, including PDC's debt.
""It delivers stronger financials, and it's a hand-in-glove fit with our portfolio,"" Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said, adding that Chevron is buying a company that was trading at relatively low multiples compared with the large amounts of cash it has been generating.
Wirth expects the acquisition to spin off $1 billion annually in extra cash while adding 1 billion barrels of proven reserves to its portfolio.
The deal comes as big oil companies are working out how to spend a giant influx of cash that sluiced into their coffers last year as oil and gas prices hit multiyear highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There has been an uptick in deal chatter throughout the industry in recent months as a result.
Larger oil companies have seen their shares trade relatively high compared with the lows of the pandemic, and compared with smaller rivals, enabling some companies to avoid touching their war chests.
Chevron had $15.7 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter, according to FactSet, and the company has said it would give priority to returning money to shareholders via share buybacks and dividends.
Compared with the headier days of America's shale boom this past decade, the premium for PDC represents a more conservative purchase, much as Chevron's single-digit premium deal for Noble Energy did in mid-2020, following the onset of the pandemic and a historic crunch in oil demand.
Noble also was a major player in the DJ Basin. For years, the DJ Basin has been seen by some companies as a potentially lucrative oil patch but difficult to master because of more stringent state-level regulations around oil-and-gas activity in Colorado.
""It's a demanding regulatory environment but both companies have proven they can operate in that environment,"" Wirth said.
Even major oil companies have been searching for smaller rivals to scoop up as they run into challenges with well productivity, a signal that the industry has drilled many of its best wells already, analysts and investors have said.
Last year, for example, the 10% of wells Chevron brought online in the Delaware basin, part of the broader Permian Basin, were about 25% less productive on average than its wells the year before, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, citing Novi Labs data.
Chevron said the PDC deal would add 10% to its oil-equivalent proved reserves for under $7 a barrel and add 275,000 net acres adjacent to its position in the DJ Basin, along with 25,000 net acres in the prolific Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field.
Chevron's transaction shows that companies' hunts for merger-and-acquisitions are beginning to culminate in deals. Last week, pipeline operator Oneok said it had agreed to buy smaller rival Magellan Midstream Partners for about $14 billion, forming one of the largest U.S. energy transportation and storage firms.
Exxon Mobil, Chevron's chief rival, also struck a far smaller deal Monday, agreeing to a $375 million cash sale of assets in the Bakken Shale of North Dakota to Chord Energy, the shale company that had emerged from the tie-up of Whiting Petroleum and Oasis Petroleum.
Exxon has held on to other assets in the Bakken worth billions, in large part because they have generated a lot of cash over this past year.
Chevron said it would issue roughly 41 million shares in the deal, slated to close by the end of the year."

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said it would reconsider a 1984 precedent some conservatives have argued grants too much power to federal regulators by directing courts to defer to an agency's legal approach when Congress has left the statutory language ambiguous.
The precedent, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, initially helped the Reagan administration fend off challenges from environmentalists. In more recent years, conservative legal groups have argued that federal judges should have more authority to set aside regulations. Several members of the Supreme Court's current conservative majority have criticized the so-called Chevron deference, or suggested that judges should be reluctant to find ambiguity in federal statutes and therefore assert more authority over regulatory agencies.
The case granted Monday involves a fishing-industry challenge to a National Marine Fisheries Service regulation involving the payment of onboard monitors who oversee compliance with federal fishery-management law. The court expressly declined to consider the technical issue of the payment scales and instead took on the far more consequential question presented: whether to overrule the Chevron decision or significantly curb its application.
""We are delighted that the court took this case not only to potentially deliver justice to these fishermen, but also to reconsider a doctrine that has enabled the widespread expansion of unchecked executive authority,"" said Paul Clement, a litigator who has won significant victories for conservative causes at the high court.
Mr. Clement, who was solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, will argue the industry's side when Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo is heard in the court's next term, which begins in October.
The Justice Department had no comment.
The Biden administration had urged the court not to take the case, saying the Chevron decision ""promotes political accountability, national uniformity, and predictability, and it respects the expertise agencies can bring to bear in administering complex statutory schemes.""
The Solicitor General's brief also said the Chevron decision wasn't an oddity, but rather ""the application of well-settled principles concerning the respective roles of agencies and courts in resolving statutory ambiguities.""
In a historical twist, it was the Reagan administration's Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Anne Gorsuch Burford -- whose son, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the Supreme Court -- who prompted the Chevron case. Ms. Burford began an anti-regulatory push, raising the ire of environmentalists by rolling back EPA rules and curbing enforcement of pollution standards.
One such effort involved altering the Carter-era EPA's definition of stationary sources of pollution under the Clean Air Act. The Natural Resources Defense Council sued, arguing the new regulation violated the Clean Air Act, and a federal appeals court agreed. Chevron U.S.A., General Motors and other companies intervened to defend the looser standard, and prevailed in the 1984 Supreme Court decision.
""If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,"" Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for a unanimous court. But ""if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,"" he said that courts should defer to reasonable interpretations by the agency charged with implementing the law.
During more recent Democratic administrations, conservatives have soured on the Chevron doctrine.
In his petition to the Supreme Court, Mr. Clement wrote that while the concept may have made sense in theory, ""Chevron has been a disaster in practice. Lower courts seeambiguity everywhere and have abdicated the core judicial responsibility of statutory construction to executive-branch agencies,"" he wrote.
In a 2016 opinion he wrote while serving on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Justice Gorsuch said the Chevron deference and another Supreme Court ruling ""permit executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design.""
""Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth,"" he wrote."

Few Supreme Court doctrines have been stretched more by regulators and lower-court judges than Chevron deference, which says judges should defer to regulators' interpretations when laws are supposedly ambiguous. The High Court agreed Monday to give Chevron a much-needed legal review.
The Court agreed to hear Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, which concerns an obscure regulation under a 1976 fishing law. The Magnuson-Stevens Act lets the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) require fishing vessels to carry federal observers on board to enforce the agency's fishing regulations.
In three narrow circumstances, the law also permits the agency to require vessels to pay the salaries of government monitors. In February 2020 the agency went further and required some vessels to foot the bill for government monitors when those narrow circumstances don't apply. This would cost fishermen about 20% of their annual revenue.
Four family-owned and -operated companies sued, arguing that the law did not authorize the mandate. In its defense, the agency cited a catchall provision in the law allowing it to ""prescribe such other measures, requirements, or conditions and restrictions as are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the conservation and management of the fishery.""
Applying the Court's Chevron (1984) framework, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's broad interpretation as ""reasonable"" because it was not expressly precluded by the law. In other words, as long as a law doesn't forbid the government from doing something, it can do it. Where have we seen this before?
The Biden vaccine mandate and eviction moratorium were particularly egregious examples. The High Court resolved challenges to those policies under its major questions doctrine, which requires clear authorization from Congress for regulations that are politically or economically significant.
The Court is taking the next logical step by agreeing to revisit its much-abused Chevron precedent. This suggests that there could be five Justices willing to overturn the doctrine or at the least pare it back, which would strengthen the separation of powers and individual liberty. More potentially good news from the High Court."

Energy prices may have come down from their 2022 highs but Big Oil is still making money hand over fist.
Investors might ask what they plan to do with all that cash.
In the US, ExxonMobil and Chevron collectively made more than $18bn in net income during the first quarter. Though down from $19.1bn pocketed by the pair in the final quarter of last year, the sum is still an extraordinary 53 per cent increase from the year-ago period. For Exxon, it was its most profitable start to the year ever.
Both Exxon and Chevron used their windfalls to reward shareholders lavishly last year and pay down debt. That should continue this year. But with underlying cash flows still well above historical norms and net debt down sharply, they may want to look at more adventurous uses for their cash.
Exxon, more than any supermajor, can afford to go shopping. It generated $16.3bn in operating cash flow during the quarter. Even after $5.8bn of capital expenditure and $8.1bn of shareholder returns, it grew its cash balance by $3bn quarter on quarter to $32.7bn. At this rate, it could end the year with $42bn of cash and cash equivalents. On top of that, the stock, at a record high of more than $119, provides additional firepower in any deal negotiations.
Adding scale to its US onshore Permian Basin production would be the obvious move. Pioneer Natural
Resources, a top-four producer there, would be a big prize. Exxon is also in that top tier, with Chevron and ConocoPhillips. A combination with Pioneer might attract antitrust scrutiny given their strong positions there. But other Permian deals, including by ConocoPhillips, have not. Pioneer trades about a quarter less than Exxon on a 2024 price to forward earnings of nine times, suggesting a cash or shares deal is still attractive.
Exxon has deflected any questions on acquisitions, saying any deal has to bring value. But, given its cash gusher, expect deal chatter to continue."

Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. collectively posted $18 billion in first-quarter profits, showing resilience even as oil and natural-gas prices declined.
The Western world's largest oil companies rocketed to record earnings last year as energy prices soared following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This year, investors fear an economic slowdown could suppress energy prices, while rising supply-chain costs have steadied at high levels. This suggests Exxon and Chevron's cash gusher peaked last year, investors said.
The oil giants still pocketed hefty earnings that beat analysts' expectations, with Exxon's quarterly net income of $11.4 billion and Chevron's $6.6 billion more than double their quarterly averages for the past 10 years, a Wall Street Journal analysis showed. The results amounted to a first-quarter record for Exxon.
Even so, both companies' earnings were off more than 40% of the record quarterly profits they reached last year.
Shares of Exxon and Chevron both rose about 1% Friday.
Despite falling prices, both companies cited climbing oil-and-gas production as critical to their returns, while adding that their efforts to boost low-carbon energy supplies are growing quickly. Exxon said its oil-and-gas production rose by almost 300,000 barrels a day compared with the same year-ago period, excluding the company's billions in asset divestments and its former operations in Russia, after the Kremlin expropriated Exxon's stake in a large project there.
Exxon had almost $33 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, a larger war chest than it has had since mid-2008, FactSet data show. The biggest question investors have had for the past year is what the Irving, Texas, oil giant will do with its windfall—boost dividends and buybacks again, or buy a smaller rival?
In a call with investors Friday, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods signaled the company for now is comfortable holding on to the cash, which can serve as a lifeline when commodity prices fall and projects become more difficult to bankroll.
The oil industry's modest deceleration comes as many American fossil-fuel companies are still struggling to explain their value proposition to Wall Street. Many investors continue to shrug off drillers after financiers lost billions on an unprofitable U.S. oil boom in the 2010s and because of the industry's vast carbon emissions.
Exxon and Chevron's messages are gaining some traction on Wall Street, investors said. Large institutional investors including BlackRock Inc., Capital Group and Boston Management & Research recently increased their positions in Exxon and some boosted their stakes in Chevron, as well, according to FactSet.
In recent months, Exxon executives have held more frequent in-person meetings with large investors discussing the company's outlook and strategy, homing in on its returns and plans for the world's anticipated shift to cleaner sources of energy, investors said.
Exxon's more active engagement with investors—increasing since it lost a proxy fight with investment firm Engine No. 1 two years ago—has helped it gain greater interest from Wall Street, as did an international scramble last year for energy supplies, according to investors.
The episode showed oil-and-gas demand will persist for years even as renewable energy sources grow, and that a growing scarcity of fossil fuels could push companies to drill for new oil discoveries, investors said.
""The math is tough without new discoveries,"" said Jeff Wyll, senior research analyst at Neuberger Berman.
Exxon announced Thursday it was moving ahead with its fifth project off the shores of Guyana, where the company is tapping vast new reserves of oil . The $12.7 billion development will pump 250,000 barrels of oil a day when it starts in 2026, Exxon said.
Chevron and Exxon's results were boosted by their fuel-making refineries, whose profitability has remained elevated as crude prices dropped.
Exxon's global refining business turned in $4.2 billion in profit, compared with a $196 million net loss in the same period last year. Meanwhile, its oil-and-gas production earnings rose 44% globally as its increased output in Guyana offset lower profit in U.S. shale.
Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said that the company was spending more money to increase future energy supplies.
""We intend to leverage our capital discipline, advantaged assets and financial strength to deliver lower carbon energy to our customers and superior cash distributions to our shareholders,"" Mr. Wirth said.
Another way oil companies may grow is through acquisitions. Exxon has been hunting for a blockbuster deal in the U.S. shale patch and has held preliminary talks with Pioneer Natural Resources Co. about possibly purchasing the American fracking giant, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month . The talks are at an early stage and a deal isn't guaranteed.
During a quarterly earnings call Thursday, Pioneer Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield said he was aware of media reports about the talks and that ""the board will always do what's in the best interest of shareholders.""
Kathryn Mikells, Exxon's finance chief, said the company was always looking at possibilities for acquisitions but was ""a pretty picky acquirer,"" focusing on ways to find synergies—often associated with spending cuts and redundancies in companies' operations—that generate shareholder value.
On Friday, Mr. Woods said the oil giant is working on technological advances in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico that could open up opportunities for acquisitions there over time.
Pierre Breber, Chevron's chief financial officer, said he expects to see a bigger impact from China reopening its economy following pandemic-related lockdowns in coming months, and that energy demand could improve in the second half of the year. Though the U.S. economic outlook is uncertain, oil supplies are likely to remain tight, he added.
""Supply growth is restrained,"" he said, noting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have slashed output capacity. ""Inventories are below average, [and there is] capital discipline by ourselves and others in the industry.""

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Geothermal has the worst of both worlds -- the exploratory risk of oil and gas and the low-return profile of solar and wind. What is in it for the energy industry?
Chevron, which divested its geothermal business in 2017, is dipping its toes back in through pilot projects or early-stage exploration in California, Japan and Indonesia. Others exploring geothermal include BP, Shell, Continental Resources, Chesapeake Energy and Murphy Oil.
While the scale of their investment is small, their interest seems to have helped warm up the geothermal-technology space. More geothermal startups launched over the past 18 months or so than in the past decade combined, according to a study published in January by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, Texas A&M University and others. While few of the emerging technologies have hit the commercialization stage, the industry is at the ""cutting edge of some breakthroughs,"" said Amanda Kolker, geoscientist and geothermal program manager at National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
The oil-and-gas industry has been a natural fit for geothermal, which taps heat under the Earth's surface. Oil-field services companies Halliburton, Baker Hughes and SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, have done geothermal work for decades. Geothermal uses many of the same drilling technologies as oil and gas, though geothermal wells are completed differently, said Ann Robertson-Tait, president of GeothermEx, a geothermal-energy consulting firm that SLB acquired in 2010.
It stands out from other renewable sources because it is available around the clock and not dependent on the weather. It requires less land compared with solar and wind farms. Despite those advantages, geothermal energy hasn't gained much steam.
While the oil-and-gas industry drills about 60,000 to 70,000 wells a year globally, there were 800 geothermal wells drilled last year, according to Henning Bjorvik, head of low-carbon supply-chain research at Rystad Energy. In the U.S., most geothermal capacity was installed in the 1980s and hasn't grown much in scale since then. It accounted for less than 0.4% of U.S. electricity generation in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
The combination of high risk and cost is to blame. Like fossil fuels, searching for a good geothermal resource involves subsurface risk. And while oil and gas can be permitted and drilled relatively quickly, geothermal projects can take seven to 10 years to bring online because of regulatory and financial barriers, according to a 2021 National Renewable Energy Laboratory report. Geothermal projects' rate of return is around 6% to 8%, similar to that of solar and wind projects, according to the study by the Texas researchers. That is well below the double-digit return oil-and-gas companies seek.
Oil-and-gas companies are investigating technologies that might help improve returns. Barbara Harrison, vice president of offsets and emerging businesses at Chevron New Energies, said the company's focus is on new geothermal technology, including enhanced geothermal systems. The technology uses hydraulic fracturing to open up pathways through which pumped fluids can become heated underground. Novel technologies would allow geothermal to be available in more places -- not just near the volcanically active Ring of Fire -- and could end up being competitive with solar or wind paired with energy storage, she said.
Geothermal energy's success will in part depend on the buy-in of the oil-and-gas industry. A rush of capital should help bring the scale necessary to bring costs down in geothermal. The industry has the lobbying force to push for geothermal-friendly policies, though gathering support for it won't be as straightforward as it was for things like carbon-capture subsidies. Cheap, widely available geothermal would be a direct competitor to natural-gas-generated electricity and heat.
Small geothermal investments are an uncomplicated green boost for the oil-and-gas industry. A true breakthrough could bring the fossil-fuel industry's deeper existential questions to the surface."

Chevron Corp.'s board of directors is considering waiving the company's mandatory retirement age for Chief Executive Mike Wirth, a move that would allow him to remain CEO for a longer period, people familiar with the matter said.
Some board members have said the San Ramon, Calif., oil company doesn't have an internal candidate ready to succeed Mr. Wirth, who would reach the company's fixed retirement age of 65 in late 2025, and that additional time would allow him to prepare a successor. The board members have also said they see no reason to push out an executive who has performed well, the people said.
Chevron's board is undertaking the yearslong process of succession planning as it faces the geopolitical uncertainty of the war in Ukraine, prospects of an economic slowdown and potential oil-market turbulence, as well as political pressure from the U.S. and Europe to prepare for a future that depends less on fossil fuels .
A Chevron spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Wirth, 62 years old, an engineer and Chevron employee for over 40 years, became chairman and CEO in 2018. At the time, Chevron had been struggling for years from project-cost overruns and its profit was laid low by an oil-market crash. Mr. Wirth was seen as a cost-conscious executive, having led the company's refining and chemicals business—in which margins are critical—for almost a decade.
As of the fifth anniversary this month of Mr. Wirth taking the helm, Chevron's shareholders have seen a total return of 70%, compared with about 71% for its U.S. rival Exxon Mobil Corp. over the same period, and about 23%, 31% and 65% for its European counterparts Shell PLC, BP PLC and TotalEnergies SE. Chevron vowed last month to repurchase $75 billion in shares—about a fifth of its market value—over the next several years, a move that was criticized by the White House, which argued it should spend the money on production to lower energy costs.
In 2019, Mr. Wirth refused to enter a bidding war when Occidental Petroleum Corp. swooped in to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. for billions more than Chevron had offered. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee and bought Noble Energy Inc. for a far lower price the next year, a deal that gave the company access to Middle East natural-gas markets and a bigger U.S. footprint.
Mr. Wirth's Chevron has also benefited from the income of investments the company made years ago, such as the over-budget Gorgon liquefied natural gas export project in Australia, and from high oil and natural-gas prices that lifted Chevron's annual profit last year to a record $35.5 billion , making it America's seventh-most prosperous company in fiscal 2022.
Nigel Hearne, who oversees Chevron's upstream, midstream and downstream units, has been seen as the foremost contender to eventually succeed Mr. Wirth, according to the people familiar with the matter. Jeff Gustavson, head of Chevron's lower-carbon energies business, and Eimear Bonner, the company's chief technology officer, are also considered contenders, the people said.
The three executives didn't respond to requests for comment.
Before the 1980s, many of the top executives of Chevron's predecessor company, Standard Oil Company of California, held the CEO position for shorter-term stints, typically around half a dozen years. Then a wave of big mergers happened, and executives began staying for much longer to oversee the company's transformations.
George Keller, who was the head of SoCal when it merged with Gulf Oil in a 1984 deal that created Chevron, served about a decade and reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 65 in 1988. The company appointed a successor, to take over at the start of 1989. Companies had put such policies in place as a check on the influence of CEOs over boards of directors.
Since then, Chevron's CEOs have held the position for around eight to 11 years, including Kenneth Derr, who succeeded Mr. Keller, David O'Reilly, who oversaw the company's merger with Texaco Inc., and John Watson, Mr. Wirth's predecessor.
Mr. Wirth is in his fifth year as CEO. Chevron might join a growing list of high-profile companies that have waived, adjusted or done away with a mandatory retirement age for top brass, including most recently retailer Target Corp., construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. and aerospace manufacturer Boeing Co.
Mr. Wirth's tenure has tested his skills navigating crises such as the historic oil downturn in 2020 and questions about the long-term future of fossil fuels. He is seen by many in the industry as an effective public emissary as it faces intense criticism from the Biden administration and other Democrats.
In a letter to President Biden last year, Mr. Wirth chided the administration's attempts to sometimes ""vilify"" the oil industry and said the U.S. energy sector needs clarity and consistency on policy matters.
Matteo Tonello, managing director at nonprofit research group The Conference Board, said more companies have quashed those rules as boards have become more independent because it ties their hands unnecessarily in succession planning.
""The prevailing view today is that boards have the competency and skill sets to develop a strong succession plan,"" Mr. Tonello said.
Some boards are also holding off on succession planning as they face significant headwinds, such as rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine, the possibility of an economic recession and ongoing snarls in the world's interconnected supply chains, said Cathy Anterasian, a consultant who leads CEO succession services for executive search firm Spencer Stuart.
""This isn't a great environment to drop in a brand new CEO,"" she said. ""Another year or two of development would accelerate readiness [of companies' internal candidates] and make the board more confident in that decision.""

Oil giant Chevron Corp. is looking to seal an energy exploration deal with Algeria, as the North African country steps up efforts to replace sanctioned Russian supplies in nearby Europe, according to people familiar with the matter.
Over the past decade, U.S. companies have pulled back from operations in oil-and-gas-rich Middle Eastern and African countries they viewed as politically risky to focus on booming shale production at home.
Yet Chevron, which is the world's second-largest Western oil company by market capitalization, recently revived talks to invest in Algeria, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron signed a memorandum of understanding with state-run company Sonatrach to investigate natural-gas opportunities in 2020 but progress had been slow until recently.
Algeria holds bigger shale gas resources than the U.S. In the past two months, Chevron has sent representatives in government relations, security and business development to the capital Algiers, some of whom have met Algerian officials, the people familiar with the matter said. The company has also hired consultants to assess the country's shale and non-shale gas resources and its contractual terms, and to map its power circles, the people said.
Tapping Middle Eastern and African natural-gas reserves has become a priority to replace sanctioned Russian gas in Europe for Chevron, which is touting huge discoveries of the resource in Egypt and Israel.
Chevron, of San Ramon, Calif., is hoping to leverage technologies developed in U.S. shale to develop the same type of reserves in Algeria, the people said. The move comes as companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. say American shale production is slowing amid rising costs.
Meanwhile, Algeria holds the third-largest recoverable shale resources in the world, with 707 trillion cubic feet, according to the Energy Information Administration. That is behind China and Argentina, but bigger than the U.S.'s 623 trillion cubic feet.
A spokeswoman for Chevron declined to comment on specific business opportunities, but said the oil major had an agreement with the state agency to access data on the Ahnet, Gourara and Berkine Basins, three of Algeria's biggest natural-gas reservoirs.
""Algeria holds a world-class petroleum system with significant potential for conventional and unconventional oil-and-gas exploration,"" the spokeswoman said.
European majors Eni SpA, TotalEnergies SA, BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC, among others, have struck accords to develop natural gas all around the Mediterranean, including in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Cyprus and Lebanon. They are seeking to substitute sanctioned supplies from Russia, historically Europe's biggest gas supplier. The companies are also seeking a source of energy that is considered less polluting than oil and coal.
Chevron stands out as a rare American company aggressively competing for natural gas on a terrain dominated by Europeans.
Western ""companies are showing renewed interest in Algeria and other North African nations at a time of rocketing demand,"" said Geoff Porter, president of U.S.-based North Africa Risk Consulting, which advises foreign investors in the region.
In mid-January, Chevron said it made a ""significant"" gas discovery in Egypt's East Mediterranean. Egypt says the find could hold 3.5 trillion cubic feet of gas—bigger than the reserves of an entire country such as Colombia. The company also has gas resources off Cyprus and a stake in the giant Leviathan field in Israeli waters.
""The region needs gas, both regionally in the Middle East, but also then obviously options to try to get that gas into Europe,"" Mike Wirth, Chevron's chief executive told analysts at the company's annual results in January.
U.S. companies have retreated from their global operations in recent years. Chevron's international output fell 3% last year following the expiration of concessions in Thailand and Indonesia. Since 2019, it has unloaded assets in Azerbaijan, Denmark, the U.K. and Brazil, among other places.
Yet last month, Chevron said it had boosted production in Venezuela by 40,000 barrels a day after the U.S. granted it a new license to pump oil there, after years of strict sanctions. The company is also in talks to develop a 600,000-barrels-a-day field in Iraq.

Oil companies delivered the market's best shareholder returns last year, but Wall Street is still wary.
The biggest Western oil companies, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and Shell PLC, together cleared a record of more than $132 billion in annual profit in 2022 and handed investors $78 billion via share buybacks and dividends, about 50% more than the last time oil topped $100 a barrel in 2014.
Fifteen of the 20 companies with the best returns in the S&P 500 index last year belonged to the oil industry, including Occidental Petroleum Corp., which had a 119% total shareholder return, according to Dow Jones data. After lagging behind every other sector from 2018 to 2020, energy has supplanted tech to lead the index for the past two years.
Yet many investors are still keeping their distance. Energy's weighting within the S&P 500 has grown to about 4.9% from about as little as 2% during the pandemic lows. But that is well below the sector's peak weighting of 16.2% in the second quarter of 2008, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Some shareholders deserted U.S. shale after incurring losses in the industry's debt-fueled oil boom in the 2010s, and fear a repeat. Others such as pension funds, endowments and faith-based organizations have sold some or all of their oil-and-gas holdings, citing concern about the industry's greenhouse-gas emissions.
The oil industry's windfall has shown that global thirst for oil and gas remains strong, despite many governments' and companies' pledges to make a transition to cleaner-energy sources. Oil and gas prices climbed to multiyear highs when Russia invaded Ukraine last year, exacerbating years of underinvestment in fossil fuels. The cost inflation has been borne partly by consumers, as U.S. pump prices surged to records and Europe faced a natural-gas crisis.
""The entire universe of investors has clearly misunderstood the time it will take to wean off oil and gas,"" said Brad Demicco, director of private markets at Southern Methodist University's investment office.
The energy sector will continue to outperform the broader market for years while supplies remain tight, said Mr. Demicco, who helps invest SMU's $2 billion endowment. While some investors might buy shares if an economic downturn weakens oil prices, he said, it appears many have exited for good because of their climate commitments.""The base of capital has shrunk permanently,"" Mr. Demicco said.
This rift comes as Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP PLC weigh their long-term strategies as countries push to reduce their dependence on oil and gas. Big questions ahead are how they plan to spend their winnings and to what extent they should invest in their traditional oil-and-gas business or renewable energy.
Just two years ago, the industry was on the ropes as the pandemic gutted fossil-fuel demand and some predicted that the end of the oil era was nearing.
Exxon in 2021 lost a historic proxy fight with the investment firm Engine No. 1, which argued that Exxon had spent lavishly on low-return projects and had no long-term climate strategy, winning three seats on Exxon's board.
Yet Exxon and Chevron both resisted pressure to pour money into renewable energy such as wind and solar, in which they would have no competitive advantage, they have told investors.
Instead, the U.S. major oil companies have significantly cut spending from prepandemic levels and pursued modest growth in their oil-and-gas businesses. They have also launched new business units investing mainly in carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels, while attempting to curb emissions.
Charles Penner, a hedge-fund veteran and an architect of Engine No. 1's proxy fight against Exxon, gives the U.S. major oil companies' strategy some credit, saying most investors want to see large oil companies focus on their highest-return opportunities that produce oil quickly, such as the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.
Those projects are likely to be profitable, even if oil demand declines in coming years, Mr. Penner said, and investors prefer them over mega offshore projects that were once the companies' bread and butter.
Those can take decades to recoup their investments, putting profitably in question if the world uses less oil.
Otherwise, he said, most investors want to see companies ""returning capital to shareholders or, if possible, investing in realistic and scalable diversification opportunities.""
So far, investors have rewarded that strategy more than those of London-based counterparts Shell and BP, which have more aggressively pledged capital to renewable and lower-carbon energy. Exxon's shares are up about 37% over the past year, and Chevron's are up about 25% in New York. Meanwhile, in London, Shell's shares are up about 19%. BP's are up about 20%.
European pension funds, governments and environmental groups have broadly applied greater pressure on European majors to cut climate-harming greenhouse-gas emissions, even as the same companies face demands to keep raising dividends and share purchases.
European officials and the Biden administration have decried oil and gas profits, and both the European Union and U.K. imposed a temporary windfall tax on the industry last year.
Another issue for investors is that it is hard to determine how any of the companies will expand their business over the long term.
Exxon, Chevron, BP and Shell have all allowed their oil production to decline from prepandemic levels. Shell and BP have said they would cut theirs further, while Exxon and Chevron haven't committed to substantial increases.
The companies said the new Inflation Reduction Act will boost cleaner-energy investments in the U.S. through tax credits that make some projects economical in ways they weren't before.
But the hoped-for wall of cleaner-energy spending faces hurdles, including supply shortages, inflation and red tape, while some of the technologies the companies have committed to, including carbon capture and hydrogen, are unproven."

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Oil-and-gas giants on both sides of the Atlantic are printing cash as energy prices stay higher for longer due to the war in Ukraine. Based on the share of its market value it is handing back to shareholders, London-listed Shell appears particularly enticing.
On Thursday, Shell became the latest big energy company to report record results for 2022. U.S. competitors Chevron and Exxon Mobil posted bumper profits in recent days. Shell more than doubled its adjusted earnings to $39.9 billion, breaking the previous record set in 2008. It made $17 billion more than it did in 2014, when Brent prices were at similar levels to today.
One reason is a strong end to the year for its liquefied-natural-gas business. A stellar result from the integrated gas division helped push fourth-quarter earnings to $9.8 billion, almost $2 billion higher than analysts had expected. The shares fell 1.18%. The good news was a welcome change from the weak third quarter, when hedges that went sour due to volatile energy prices dragged on group profit.
Shell handed $26 billion to its shareholders last year. Its all-in distribution yield, measuring total dividends and buybacks as a share of average market value, was 13% in 2022, according to brokerage Bernstein, compared with 8% and 7%, respectively, at Exxon Mobil and Chevron.
Some of that difference reflects the widening valuation gap between European and U.S. oil-and-gas stocks. Shell changes hands for under seven times forward earnings, compared with roughly 11 for Exxon and Chevron. Investors are dubious that a push into renewables at Shell and BP can deliver the same returns as fossil fuels.
But there has been a major step-up in share buybacks at Europe's integrated energy companies. In 2022, they spent $42 billion on their own stock, up from $9 billion in 2021.
That can last only as long as companies are making fat profits. Yet it fits with a wider trend toward share buybacks among European companies, particularly in the energy and finance sectors. Bernstein calculates European companies announced buybacks equivalent to 2.4% of their market capitalization on average over the past 12 months, compared with 2.2% for U.S. companies -- the first time in at least 20 years that the region overtook U.S. equities on this measure.
For now, the cash is still coming. Shell increased its fourth-quarter dividend by 15% and said it would buy back $4 billion of its shares between now and its first-quarter results. Europe's energy majors have work to do to close the widening valuation gap with their American competitors. Generous shareholder returns should help."

Behold the irony. President Biden has done more to enrich Big Oil and its shareholders than Donald Trump or any other White House occupant in decades. See how his Administration's crusade to limit U.S. oil and gas production is reaping record profits for Exxon Mobil and other fossil-fuel giants.
Exxon on Tuesday reported a record $55.7 billion annual profit last year, surpassing its $45 billion haul in 2008. This makes Exxon among the most profitable companies in American history. What a dramatic change of fortune. Two years ago, Exxon and other oil companies were bleeding cash as prices plunged early in the pandemic. Fossil-fuel opponents celebrated.
But as economies recovered, so did oil demand. Long-haul trucks and airplanes can't run on solar power or batteries. Global production lagged, however, especially in the U.S. Some Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries members curtailed investment during the pandemic because they didn't expect demand to rebound as quickly as it did.
At the same time, giants such as BP and Shell steered more capital to renewable energy. As prices began to climb in 2021, U.S. producers faced investor pressure to restrain investment in new production because no one knew how long the good times would last, especially amid the political assault on fossil fuels and proclamations that the death of oil was nigh.
Exxon defied the crowd and thus profited inordinately from last year's high oil prices. ""We leaned in when others leaned out, bucking conventional wisdom,"" CEO Darren Woods said Tuesday. Not that other giants aren't enjoying healthy earnings too. Chevron last week announced a record annual $36.5 billion profit and $75 billion stock buyback program.
Chevron's announcement drew a testy and defensive response from the White House. The only thing getting in the way of companies increasing production ""is their own decision to keep plowing windfall profits into the pockets of executives and shareholders instead of using them to boost supply,"" a White House spokesperson said.
But Big Oil companies are merely benefiting from supply shortages and production constraints the Administration has helped to create. U.S. production remains about 900,000 barrels a day below the pre-pandemic peak, twice as much as Russian oil exports have declined since the Ukraine invasion. ""We are underinvesting as an industry in this space,"" Mr. Woods accurately explained.
Why, pray tell, is that? One reason is the Administration and European governments have told companies that their products will soon become obsolete. Another is the Administration's regulatory fusillade against the industry. It has delayed lease sales, dragged its feet on permitting pipelines, and tightened renewable-fuel mandates that raise costs for refiners.
As a case in point, consider the White House's proposed guidance this month that would require federal agencies to calculate indirect greenhouse gas emissions for fossil-fuel projects, including new oil and gas leases. Agencies would also have to analyze potential renewable alternatives, which would make it easier to block the projects.
Renewable projects would be exempt from this onerous GHG analysis even if the solar panels are made in China using coal power. Big Oil companies will survive the regulatory onslaught and may benefit financially if smaller rivals go under and prices continue rising as Chinese demand grows with the end of zero-Covid. Those who will pay for these Biden policies are American consumers."

Chevron Corp. banked historic profit last year as the pandemic receded and the war in Ukraine pushed oil prices to multiyear highs, with its shares climbing 53% for the year while other sectors tumbled.
The U.S. oil company in its quarterly earnings reported Friday that it collected $35.5 billion in its highest-ever annual profit in 2022, more than double the prior year and about one-third higher than its previous record in 2011. Almost $50 billion in cash streamed in from its oil-leveraged operations, another record that is underpinning plans to pay investors through a new
 $75 billion share-repurchase program over the next several years.
That payout, announced Wednesday, is roughly equivalent to the stock-market value of companies such as the big-box retailer Target Corp., the pharmaceutical firm Moderna Inc. and Airbnb Inc.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company after Exxon Mobil Corp., posted revenue of $246.3 billion, up from $162.5 billion the previous year. The San Ramon, Calif., company reported a fourth-quarter profit of $6.4 billion, up from $5.1 billion in the same period the prior year.
The fourth-quarter results came short of analyst expectations, and Chevron shares closed down more than 4% Friday.
For all of its recent winnings, though, Chevron and its rival oil-and-gas producers could face a rockier year in 2023, according to investors and analysts, if an anticipated slowdown in U.S. economic growth dents demand for oil, and if China's reopening from strict Covid-19 restrictions unfolds slowly.
 U.S. oil prices have held steady this year, but are off about 36% from last year's peak. The industry is proceeding with caution, holding capital expenditures for 2023 below prepandemic levels and saying production will grow only modestly. Chevron has said it plans to spend about $17 billion in capital expenditures this year, up more than 25% from the prior year, but $3 billion less than it planned to spend in 2020 before Covid-19 took root.
Oil companies are still outperforming other sectors such as tech and finance, which have seen widespread job cuts in recent weeks. The energy segment of the S&P 500 index has climbed 43.7% over the past year, compared with a 6.7% drop for the broader index.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said the company is unsure of what 2023 will bring after global energy supplies were squeezed because of geopolitical events last year, particularly in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He said markets appeared to be stabilizing.
""We certainly have seen a very unusual and volatile year in 2022,"" Mr. Wirth said, noting the European energy crisis has proven less dire than anticipated thanks to milder winter weather, growing natural gas inventories in Europe. ""China's economy has been slow throughout the year, which looks to be turning around. It's good that markets have calmed.""
Chevron hit a record in U.S. oil-and-gas production in 2022, increasing 4% to about 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent a day, stemming from its increased focus on capital investments in the Western Hemisphere, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where it boosted output 16% last year. Worldwide, Chevron's oil-and-gas production was down 3.2% compared with the prior year, at 2.99 million barrels of oil-equivalent a day.
Its overall return on capital employed came in at 20%, it said.
""There aren't many sectors generating the type of free cash flow that energy is right now,"" said Jeff Wyll, an analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman, which has invested in Chevron. ""The sector really can't be ignored. Given the supply-demand balance, you have to have some things go wrong here to see a pullback in oil prices.""
Even so, institutional investors have shown limited interest so far in returning to the energy sector, after years of poor returns and heightened concerns about their environmental impact prompted large financiers to sell off their stakes in oil-and-gas companies or stop investing in drillers outright.
Pete Bowden, global head of industrial, energy and infrastructure banking at Jefferies Financial Group Inc., said energy companies in the S&P 500 index are throwing off 12% of the group's free-cash flow, but only account for about 5% of the index's weighting—an indication their stock prices are lagging behind.
Investors' concerns around environmental, social and governance-related issues are a constraint on the share prices of energy companies, ""yet the earnings power of these businesses is superior to the earnings power of companies in other sectors,"" he said.
Chevron and others have faced criticism from the Biden administration and others that they are giving priority to shareholder returns over pumping oil and gas at a time when global supplies are tight and Americans are feeling pain at the pump. On Thursday, the White House assailed Chevron's $75 billion buyout program , saying the payout was proof the company could boost production but was choosing to reward investors instead.
Pierre Breber, Chevron's finance chief, said the company expects oil prices to be volatile but within a range needed to sustain its dividend and investments. There are some optimistic signs, he added, including that the U.S. economy grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter, at 2.9%.
""Supply is tight. Oil-field services are near capacity, and we continue to have sanctions on Russian production,"" Mr. Breber said. ""You're seeing international flights out of China are way up, and low unemployment in the U.S.""
Mr. Breber said Chevron's output in the Permian this year is expected to grow at a slower pace, around 10%, because it has exhausted much of its inventory of wells that it had drilled but hadn't brought into production.
Exxon, which has typically posted quarterly earnings on the same day as Chevron, will report Tuesday. Analysts expect it will also post record profit for 2022, according to FactSet.
Both companies expect to slow their output growth this year in the Permian, considered their growth engine. The two U.S. oil majors, which had been growing output faster in the U.S. than most independent shale producers, are beginning to step up their focus on shareholder returns and allow output growth to ease, said Neal Dingmann, an analyst at Truist Securities.
""This has all been driven by investor requirements,"" Mr. Dingmann said.

The globe is shrinking for Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. as the two largest U.S. oil companies pull back on big international oil projects and concentrate on a handful of more lucrative assets closer to home.
The two fossil-fuel giants plan to spend most of their annual budgets in the Americas this year, with Chevron saying it will pour 70% of the capital allocated for production into oil fields in the U.S., Argentina and Canada, and Exxon saying it will spend a similar portion of its budget in the Permian Basin of New Mexico and West Texas , Guyana, Brazil and liquefied natural-gas projects.
Their focus on the Western Hemisphere is expected to continue for years as they give priority to growing shareholder returns and cut costly frontier drilling projects. Their retreat from places such as southeast Asia, West Africa, Russia and parts of Latin America—sometimes by choice, sometimes by fiat— marks an era of retrenchment for companies that had spent decades putting stakes in the ground around the world.
""The cases of them going to new countries are few and far between,"" said Ben Cahill, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. ""It's a natural consequence of investors demanding higher returns. Companies are being more selective.""
For much of their modern history, Chevron and Exxon scoured the globe for oil to add to their booked reserves, a key metric upon which investors valued them, often entering into partnerships with state-run companies in the most challenging, costly projects. Mr. Cahill said the advent of U.S. shale eased Western oil companies' concerns about securing oil supplies, and a shareholder revolt against the industry's overspending a few years ago pushed them to shrink their footprints further.
Last year, Irving, Texas-based Exxon sold or proposed to sell assets in Chad, Cameroon, Egypt, Iraq and Nigeria, along with some legacy assets in the U.S. and Canada, making for its largest number of such sales since 2018, according to FactSet. The company had planned since 2018 to sell at least $15 billion worth in assets as it pared down its global footprint and focused on its most valuable assets.

The company's oil and gas production was down in 2021 by almost 18% compared with its annual peak in 2011, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Around that time, Exxon was pursuing scores of projects across the world and made most of its money outside the U.S. The days of managing numerous international projects are running out, said Neal Dingmann, an analyst at Truist Securities.
""You have investors leaning on you harder than they have in the past,"" Mr. Dingmann said. ""It's going to be critical that they prune their other [noncore] businesses.""
Meanwhile, Chevron's international output fell 3% last year following the expiration of concessions in Thailand and Indonesia. Last year, it vowed to exit Myanmar, citing human-rights violations. Since 2019, it has unloaded assets in Azerbaijan, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Brazil, among other places.
Chevron has held on to some international assets close to home. The U.S. has granted it a new license to pump oil in Venezuela again, after years of sanctions. So far, it has said it won't make new investments in the country, only maintain existing assets while it collects debt from its state-run joint venture partner. Chevron would have to contend with myriad technical issues at Venezuela's aging oil fields and take on political risk to expand there.
In 2021, Exxon's land holdings with active wells were 18% smaller than they were in 2010; Chevron's were 40% smaller, FactSet data showed. As they have cut costs, their earnings have jumped, as both hit record quarterly profits last year, and Wall Street analysts estimated they were poised for the year to collect the highest profits since at least 2008, according to FactSet.
Exxon said in December it would spend up to $25 billion each year through 2027, in line with its previously announced plans but below prepandemic levels, and it aims to boost oil and gas production by 500,000 barrels a day over that period. It also plans to trim $9 billion in costs by the end of this year, compared with 2019. Chevron said it would boost spending 25% this year to $14 billion, well below its prepandemic budget.
In December, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said this strategy would win back investors. Many generalist investors fled the energy sector after years of poor returns caused by overspending. The energy segment of the S&P 500 outperformed the broader index last year, rising about 59% in 2022, compared with the index's 19% drop for the year .
Still, most institutions continue to give oil companies a wide berth, recuperating from the sting of big losses over the past decade, said Kevin Holt, a portfolio manager at investment firm Invesco Ltd., which has about $1.44 trillion in assets under management, according to its most recent regulatory filings.
""They don't think the industry will stick to capital discipline,"" Mr. Holt said. ""It's going to take a little more time,"" for investors to believe that oil companies have permanently changed their spending habits.
The most significant shift away from a foreign country last year was in Russia. The Kremlin wiped out Exxon's stake there in a major oil-and-gas project it had operated since the 1990s, after Exxon tried to exit from the venture following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Establishing a foothold in Russia had been a key part of former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson's strategy. Few opportunities of that scale exist now, at least in the oil industry's traditional oil and gas business, said Tatiana Mitrova, research fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.
Exxon and Chevron have said they plan to expand into new businesses providing low-carbon technologies to other companies, where they could explore partnerships with countries and state-run companies that typically don't have access to those technologies, Ms. Mitrova said.
""The majors are quite well positioned to develop the new technologies like hydrogen, carbon capture and other new things that will help the industry decarbonize,"" she said.

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Dec. 31 -- US oil company Chevron Corp is sending two oil tankers to Venezuela, one of which will load the first cargo of crude destined for the United States in nearly four years, according to a person familiar with the matter and shipping data.On Friday, a Chevron-chartered vessel approached the South American country's waters to pick up a cargo of Venezuelan crude. A second tanker carrying a cargo of diluents to a Chevron oil joint venture is due to arrive in Venezuela early next month, the person said.The US last month issued a six-month license to Chevron authorizing it to take an expanded role at four Venezuelan oil joint ventures that produce, process and export oil, and to bring their oil to the United States, reports Reuters.The US licence will reopen oil flows that were shut by US sanctions nearly four years ago. The licence was one of Washington's first steps to ease sanctions as an incentive for Venezuela to work with opposition leaders on a presidential election in late 2023.A Chevron spokesman declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing commercial matters.Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.MORE FLEXIBLE TERMSAnalysts said the new oil flows could set the stage for additional concessions by the administrations of Venezuela's Socialist President Nicolas Maduro and US President Joe Biden. No 2 US oil producer Chevron could return to a historical role in Venezuela's oil production and processing over time, they said.""The main scenario is to expect the license will become more flexible as political talks progress,"" said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin American energy expert at Rice University's Baker Institute. ""The United States seems to be following a strategy of carrots in a row: Maduro will have to comply with steps in the negotiation.""""There might be new licenses, not out of promises but out of verifiable changes,"" added Fernando Fernandez, a Venezuelan lawyer and expert in sanctions.Washington officials have said further easing of Venezuelan oil sanctions could come with a reinstatement of excluded political candidates and election observers.FIRST US LOADINGThe Bahamas-flagged tanker Caribbean Voyager is set to load Venezuelan oil for exports to the United States in the coming days, while the Marshall Islands-flagged UACC Eagle is sailing to Venezuela's Jose oil port to discharge naphtha for the joint venture Petropiar, according to the person and Refinitiv Eikon vessel monitoring data.The cargoes are the first under the US Treasury Department's November license allowing Chevron to expand its operations in Venezuela.The Biden administration previously had authorized European oil companies to receive Venezuelan crude to recoup pending debt, removed individual sanctions on some Venezuelans, and released relatives of Venezuela's first lady who were convicted of drug trafficking charges.Chevron earlier this year had requested a broader license that would allow it to take operational control of its joint ventures in Venezuela, but Washington opted for a limited authorization set to be scalable as political talks progress.""What Chevron was granted is a bit far from what it requested, but it could be modified,"" said Jose Ignacio Hernandez, Venezuela's former attorney general. Chevron also faces ""enormous compliance demands"" by Washington in its financial dealings with PDVSA, he said.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Dec. 9 -- The two largest US oil companies - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp - disclosed plans to increase outlays on energy projects next year amid high oil demand and prices.While spending more, it will be less than half the combined $84 billion they spent in 2013, when oil prices often traded above $100 per barrel as it has this year. The two are awash in cash from those prices and past cost-cuts, and have sharply raised shareholder payouts, according to Reuters.The focus on shareholder returns have led to pressure from the White House. The Biden administration has criticised oil companies for not raising their oil production to help lower prices to consumers. Still, next year's budgets remain within the ranges each set before the war in Ukraine fed a global shortage of energy.Exxon said it would increase project investments next year to between $23 billion to $25 billion, up from a projected $22 billion this year. Chevron said it plans to spend $17 billion, up from about $15 billion this year. Increases include new monies for emissions reduction projects and the impact of inflation.The higher spending will not immediately lead to more production. Exxon has said it expects output next year to be flat at about 3.7 million barrels of equivalent oil per day (boed), while Chevron has forecast a greater than 3 per cent compound average annual increase through 2026.Exxon will miss its goal of pumping 1 million boed from its Permian operations by about two years, Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said on Thursday. It now aims to reach between 900,000-1 million boed in 2027.The biggest change will be the amount of cash earned. Exxon sees potential for $100 billion in surplus cash by 2027, assuming global oil prices of $60 per barrel. Chevron should generate about $34 billion in free cash flow next year, according to Jefferies equity research, twice its oil investments levels.""This leaves ample room for opportunistic M&A, increases to the buyback or simply even lower leverage with an eye toward increasing buybacks at a lower share price,"" said Jefferies equity analysts Lloyd Byrne and Sam Burwell.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

| Jump to first hitDhaka, Dec. 3 -- Venezuela's oil minister and top representatives of state-run company PDVSA on Friday signed contracts with US oil firm Chevron Corp intended to help revive the nation's oil output and expand operations.The United States last week granted Chevron a six-month license authorising it to take a broader role in existing projects in US-sanctioned Venezuela, a move to encourage political talks between the government of President Nicolas Maduro and the country's opposition towards elections, reports Reuters.The contracts include the PDVSA-Chevron joint ventures Petroboscan and Petropiar, officials said. The agreements are expected to help restore lost production, recoup debt owed to Chevron and generate more jobs. The projects currently are producing about 100,000 barrels per day of crude (bpd), leaving room for a rapid increase.""This is an important step towards the right direction, but yet insufficient,"" said oil minister Tareck El Aissami after the signing ceremony. ""We demand the lifting of punishing measures that have hit our industry,"" he added.The event took place at PDVSA's Caracas headquarters and was attended by El Aissami, Chevron's Venezuela President Javier La Rosa and PDVSA President Asdrubal Chavez. Other details of the agreements were not disclosed.Chevron did not comment on the meeting but said in a statement that it complies with US sanctions and remains ""committed to the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, the integrity of our joint venture assets, and the company's social and humanitarian programs.""Chevron also has not made public the content of a pre-agreement with PDVSA that it used to request the license from the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The authorization was required because of US sanctions on PDVSA and Venezuela's oil sector.Earlier this year, OFAC authorized Chevron to hold meetings with Venezuelan officials, including people specifically sanctioned by Washington, like El Aissami.Chevron CEO Michael Wirth on Thursday said it is unlikely the company will add investment in the coming six months with Washington looking for additional political developments before it agrees to steps to boost output and expand operations.The licence, which gave a green light to Chevron for trading Venezuelan crude in the United States, does not allow royalties or any other tax payments to Venezuela as a way to avoid proceeds from sales reaching Maduro's coffers.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express."

| Jump to first hitEl gobierno de Biden dio un giro importante en su política hacia Venezuela al permitir que Chevron Corp. bombee petróleo en el país sudamericano de nuevo, pero la decisión supondrá un escaso aumento de la producción mundial de petróleo a corto plazo.La empresa estadounidense tendrá que enfrentarse a una miríada de problemas técnicos en los envejecidos campos petrolíferos de Venezuela y a una complicada red de sanciones estadounidenses restantes que deben modificarse para garantizar que más petróleo del país llegue al mercado mundial.El sábado, el Departamento del Tesoro concedió a Chevron una nueva licencia para operar en Venezuela tras una reunión en Ciudad de México entre el gobierno del venezolano Nicolás Maduro y los grupos de la oposición en la que los participantes acordaron que Venezuela gastaría miles de millones de fondos congelados en ayuda humanitaria e infraestructuras en un programa que sería administrado por las Naciones Unidas. Funcionarios estadounidenses habían señalado el regreso de Chevron a Venezuela como una razón para que las partes comenzaran a negociar un calendario y un marco para la celebración de elecciones libres.El cambio de política se produce dos años después de que el gobierno de Trump tomara medidas drásticas contra las actividades de Chevron y otras compañías petroleras en Venezuela como parte de una campaña de “máxima presión” destinada a derrocar al gobierno dirigido por Maduro. Esa política incluyó la retirada del reconocimiento de Maduro y el respaldo al líder del Congreso Juan Guaidó como presidente legítimo de Venezuela.El alejamiento puede abrir la puerta a otras empresas petroleras que habían operado anteriormente en Venezuela, aunque el Departamento del Tesoro no explicó cómo podrían volver a participar en el país.Entre las primeras tareas de Chevron están las de reparar los equipos averiados, detener los cortes de energía y arreglar los problemas de los oleoductos, volver a contratar a cientos de trabajadores a pesar del éxodo de talentos de la industria petrolera venezolana, y hacer frente a las amenazas de seguridad física, incluyendo los robos de gasolina, dijeron los analistas.“La cantidad de dinero que se necesita invertir en Venezuela para recuperar la producción perdida es tremenda”, comentó José Chalhoub, analista de riesgo político y de petróleo en Venezuela, que anteriormente trabajó en la industria petrolera del país.Chalhoub estimó que las inversiones necesarias para recuperar la producción de petróleo perdida en Venezuela podrían ascender a US$ 50.000 millones. En los próximos seis meses, dijo, Chevron podría aumentar la producción en unos 20.000 a 30.000 barriles al día, demasiado poco para marcar la diferencia en el mercado mundial.A su vez, Venezuela también ha tenido problemas para conseguir suficientes diluyentes -líquidos que facilitan el flujo del viscoso petróleo venezolano, que antes procedía principalmente de Estados Unidos- desde que el país norteamericano impuso las sanciones.Antes de que Chevron esté dispuesta a realizar nuevas inversiones en Venezuela, como por ejemplo en nuevos yacimientos, quiere cobrar más de US$ 4.000 millones de deuda a la compañía petrolera nacional de Venezuela, Petróleos de Venezuela SA.El cobro de esa deuda podría llevar de dos a tres años, ya que PdVSA debe a Chevron y a otros socios de la empresa conjunta su parte de más de dos años de ingresos por la venta de petróleo, después de que las sanciones estadounidenses de 2020 prohibieran a la empresa venezolana pagar a sus socios. La licencia permitiría a Chevron cobrar su parte de los dividendos de sus empresas conjuntas, como Petropiar, en la que Chevron es socio en un 30%.En los primeros 25 días de septiembre, PdVSA, que opera las empresas conjuntas de Chevron, produjo unos 45.000 barriles diarios, según la consultora IPD Latin America. La producción del país se redujo a 686.000 barriles diarios en el mismo periodo, frente a los más de 900.000 barriles diarios de diciembre, según la firma.Aunque Venezuela cuenta con las mayores reservas de petróleo del mundo, Chevron podría tardar al menos un año en recuperar la producción de petróleo de 200.000 barriles diarios en sus cuatro empresas conjuntas con PdVSA, según los analistas.Esto es una gota de agua en comparación con la cantidad de petróleo que podría verse afectada por las sanciones occidentales al petróleo ruso. Algunos analistas estiman que alrededor de 1,5 millones de barriles diarios podrían verse afectados por esas sanciones el próximo año. La producción de petróleo de Venezuela ha languidecido en torno a los 700.000 barriles diarios este año, frente a los más de tres millones de barriles diarios de la década de 1990.Es poco probable que el regreso inicial de Chevron a Venezuela ayude a aliviar pronto los precios del petróleo, según los analistas.“Esto no es algo que vaya a ocurrir de la noche a la mañana. Con el tiempo añadirá barriles a la oferta mundial, pero tardará meses, si no más de un año”, advirtió Robert Yawger, analista de Mizuho.El desarrollo de Venezuela se valoró con un descuento de sólo US$ 1 por barril de petróleo a corto plazo, dijo Yawger.Ahora bien, mucho dependerá también de las próximas negociaciones entre el gobierno de Nicolás Maduro de Venezuela y los partidos de la oposición, que tienen el potencial de lanzar una llave en el engranaje de Chevron si las dos partes no pueden llegar a un acuerdo.Siete millones de venezolanos han huido del que fue un país rico en petróleo, que ha atravesado un colapso económico debido a la mala gestión económica y la corrupción del gobierno de Maduro, así como al impacto de las sanciones internacionales.Pero con el fracaso de la estrategia de máxima presión seguida por el gobierno de Trump, Maduro es ahora más fuerte políticamente que nunca.“Podría ser que un gobierno que se siente seguro puede dar más concesiones que uno que se siente acorralado”, sostuvo Javier Corrales, experto en Venezuela del Amherst College.Funcionarios del gobierno de Biden dijeron que la licencia prohíbe a PdVSA recibir beneficios de las ventas de petróleo de Chevron. Aseguraron también que Estados Unidos está preparado para revocar o modificar la licencia, que estará en vigor durante seis meses, en cualquier momento si Venezuela no negocia de buena fe.CREDIT: Collin Eaton de The Wall Street Journal"

In negotiating with oil-producing dictators, the Biden Administration has a consistent strategy: Make concessions in hope the other side will return the favor. It hasn't worked with Iran, and now the White House is trying with the thugs who run Venezuela. What could go wrong?
The U.S. lifted Trump-era sanctions on Caracas over the weekend, renewing a license for Chevron to pump oil again in its joint ventures with the state-owned oil company PdVSA. The U.S. will also unfreeze $3 billion in Venezuelan assets for what it says will be ""humanitarian"" needs. In exchange, dictator Nicolás Maduro is promising to negotiate free and fair elections in talks with the opposition in Mexico City.
Venezuela once produced 3.4 million barrels of oil a day and was the richest nation in Latin America. But two decades of socialism have degraded petroleum infrastructure and exiled human capital. PdVSA now pumps fewer than 700,000 barrels a day, and Mr. Maduro relies on narcotics trafficking to pay his military.
Mr. Maduro wants to produce more oil, and the Biden Administration also wants more oil to replace Russian supplies reduced by the Ukraine war. Easing permitting rules on U.S. federal land offends the Democratic Party's climate donors. So the Administration has gone hat in hand to OPEC and the Saudis and now Venezuela. It's mind-boggling to see the U.S. go begging to dictators when the U.S. has huge untapped reserves.
Oil analysts say that even with new licenses Venezuelan output is unlikely to increase by more than about 0.2% of world demand in the next year or two. So the Administration now says the sanctions relief for Caracas is unrelated to oil and instead is a carrot for talking with the opposition about returning to democracy.
Venezuela has made similar overtures before, only to rig the next election. Why would Mr. Maduro change now that he has the sanctions concessions he wants? The opposition is going along more or less because it has few other options, and the U.S. made an offer it couldn't refuse.
The U.S. says Venezuela won't benefit because the oil license stipulates that Chevron may not pay taxes or royalties to Venezuela or dividends to PdVSA and must sell the oil in the U.S. market. But there is sure to be leakage in a joint venture majority-owned by the regime. PdVSA will use the oil shipments to repay the hundreds of millions of dollars it owes Chevron, which will reduce Venezuelan debt. The $3 billion in unfrozen assets is supposed to go to a fund managed by the United Nations, but the money will help the regime sustain itself in power.
The deal welcomes Mr. Maduro back to the world community as a respectable ruler rather than a rogue who has impoverished his country and unleashed millions of refugees on his neighbors. The U.S. says the six-month lease with Chevron won't be renewed if Mr. Maduro doesn't negotiate in good faith with his opponents. Maybe if Texas declared itself to be a dictatorship, President Biden would negotiate and allow more U.S. oil production.

The Biden administration made a significant shift in its Venezuela policy when it allowed Chevron Corp. to pump oil in the South American country again, but the decision will yield little increase to the world's oil production in the short-term.
The U.S. company will have to contend with myriad technical issues at Venezuela's aging oil fields and a complicated network of remaining U.S. sanctions that must be altered to ensure more of the country's oil reaches the global market.
On Saturday, the Treasury Department granted Chevron a new license to operate in Venezuela following a meeting in Mexico City between the government of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro and opposition groups in which the participants agreed Venezuela would spend billions of frozen funds on humanitarian aid and infrastructure in a program to be administered by the United Nations. U.S. officials had held out Chevron's return to Venezuela as a reason for the parties to begin negotiations on a timeline and framework for free elections.
 The policy shift comes two years after the Trump administration clamped down on Chevron and other oil companies' activities in Venezuela as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign aimed at ousting the government led by Mr. Maduro. That policy included withdrawing recognition from Mr. Maduro and backing congressional leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president of Venezuela .
The shift away may open the door to other oil companies that had previously operated in Venezuela, as well, though the Treasury Department didn't outline how they might re-engage with the country.
Among Chevron's first tasks are to make repairs to broken equipment, stop power outages and fix problems with pipelines, rehire hundreds of workers despite an exodus of talent from Venezuela's oil industry, and deal with physical security threats including gasoline thefts, analysts said.
""The amount of money needed to invest in Venezuela to recover the lost production is tremendous,"" said José Chalhoub, a political risk and oil analyst in Venezuela who previously worked in the country's oil industry.
Mr. Chalhoub estimated the investments needed to restore Venezuela's lost oil production could come to as much as $50 billion. Over the next six months or so, he said, Chevron might increase output by some 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day, too little to make any difference to the global market.
Venezuela has also struggled to get enough diluents—liquids that ease the flow of Venezuela's viscous oil, once primarily sourced from the U.S.—since the U.S. imposed sanctions.
Before Chevron is willing to make new investments in Venezuela, such as in new fields, it wants to collect more than $4 billion in debt from the Venezuela national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA.
Collecting that debt could take two to three years, as PdVSA owes Chevron and other joint-venture partners their shares of more than two years of revenue from oil sales, after the 2020 U.S. sanctions barred the Venezuelan company from paying its partners. The license would allow Chevron to collect its share of dividends from its joint ventures such as Petropiar, in which Chevron is a 30% partner.
In the first 25 days of September, PdVSA operating the Chevron joint ventures produced about 45,000 barrels a day, according to the consulting firm IPD Latin America. The country's output fell to 686,000 barrels a day in the same period, down from more than 900,000 barrels a day in December, the firm said.
Though Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves, it could take at least a year for Chevron to bring oil production back to 200,000 barrels a day at its four joint ventures with PdVSA, analysts said.
That is a drop in the bucket compared with the amount of oil that could be impacted by Western sanctions on Russian oil. Some analysts estimate about 1.5 million barrels a day could be affected by those sanctions next year. Venezuela's oil production has languished around 700,000 barrels a day this year, down from more than three million barrels a day in the 1990s.
Chevron's initial push back into Venezuela is unlikely to help ease oil prices soon, analysts said.
""This isn't something that's going to happen overnight. It will add barrels over time to global supply but it will take months if not over a year,"" said Robert Yawger, an analyst at Mizuho.
The Venezuela development was valued at only about $1 per barrel discount on oil in the short-term, Mr. Yawger said.
Much will also depend on coming negotiations between the government of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro and opposition parties, which have the potential to throw a wrench in Chevron's gears if the two sides cannot come to an agreement.
Seven million Venezuelans have fled the once-oil rich country, which has gone through an economic meltdown because of the Maduro government's economic mismanagement and corruption as well as the impact of international sanctions.
But with the failure of the maximum pressure strategy followed by the Trump administration, Mr. Maduro is stronger politically now than ever before.
""It could be that a government that feels secure may give more concessions than one that feels cornered,"" says Javier Corrales, a Venezuela expert at Amherst College.
Biden administration officials said the license prohibits PdVSA from receiving profits from Chevron's oil sales. The officials said the U.S. is prepared to revoke or amend the license, which will be in effect for six months, at any time if Venezuela doesn't negotiate in good faith.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. said it would allow Chevron Corp. to resume pumping oil from its Venezuelan oil fields after President Nicolás Maduro's government and an opposition coalition agreed to implement an estimated $3 billion humanitarian relief program and continue dialogue in Mexico City on efforts to hold free and fair elections.
Following the Norwegian-brokered agreement signed in Mexico City, the Biden administration granted a license to Chevron that allows the California-based oil company to return to its oil fields in joint ventures with the Venezuela national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. The new license, granted by the Treasury Department, permits Chevron to pump Venezuelan oil for the first time in years.
Biden administration officials said the license prohibits PdVSA from receiving profits from Chevron's oil sales. The officials said the U.S. is prepared to revoke or amend the license, which will be in effect for six months, at any time if Venezuela doesn't negotiate in good faith.
""If Maduro again tries to use these negotiations to buy time to further consolidate his criminal dictatorship, the United States and our international partners must snap back the full force of our sanctions,"" said Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The U.S. policy shift could signal an opening for other oil companies to resume their business in Venezuela two years after the Trump administration clamped down on Chevron and other companies' activities there as part of a maximum-pressure campaign meant to oust the government led by Mr. Maduro. The Treasury Department action didn't say how non-U.S. oil companies might re-engage with Venezuela.
Venezuela produces some 700,000 barrels of oil a day, compared with more than 3 million barrels a day in the 1990s. Some analysts said Venezuela could hit 1 million barrels a day in the medium term, a modest increment reflecting the dilapidated state of the country's state-led oil industry.
Some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration's decision to clear the way for Chevron to pump more oil in Venezuela. ""The Biden administration should allow American energy producers to unleash DOMESTIC production instead of begging dictators for oil,"" Rep. Claudia Tenney (R., N.Y.) wrote on Twitter.
Biden administration officials said the decision to issue the license wasn't a response to oil prices, which have been a major concern for President Biden and his top advisers in recent months as they seek to tackle inflation. ""This is about the regime taking the steps needed to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,"" one of the officials said.
The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the Biden administration was preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's regime to allow Chevron to resume pumping oil there.
Under the new license, profits from the sale of oil will go toward repaying hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed to Chevron by PdVSA, administration officials said. The U.S. will require that Chevron report details of its financial operations to ensure transparency, they said.
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the new license allows the company to commercialize the oil currently being produced at its joint-venture assets. He said the company will conduct its business in compliance within the current framework.
The license prohibits Chevron from paying taxes and royalties to the Venezuelan government, which surprised some experts. They had been expecting that direct revenue would encourage PdVSA to reroute oil cargoes away from obscure export channels, mostly to Chinese buyers at a steep discount, which Venezuela has relied on for years to skirt sanctions.
""If this is the case, Maduro doesn't have significant incentives to allow that many cargoes of Chevron to go out,"" said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University's Baker Institute for Public Policy. Sending oil to China, even at a heavy discount, would be better for Caracas than only paying debt to Chevron, he said.
The limited scope of the Chevron license is seen as a way to ensure that Mr. Maduro stays the course on negotiations. ""Rather than fully opening the door for Venezuelan oil to flow to the U.S. market immediately, what the license proposes is a normalization path that is likely contingent on concessions from the Maduro regime on the political and human-rights front,"" said Luisa Palacios, senior research scholar at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy.
The license allows Venezuelan oil back into the U.S., historically its largest market, but only if the oil from the PdVSA-Chevron joint ventures is first sold to Chevron and doesn't authorize exports from the ventures ""to any jurisdiction other than the United States,"" which appears to restrict PdVSA's own share of the sales to the U.S. market, said Mr. Monaldi.
The license prohibits transactions involving goods and services from Iran, a U.S.-sanctioned oil producer that has helped Venezuela overcome sanctions in recent years. It blocks dealings with Venezuelan entities owned or controlled by Western-sanctioned Russia , which has played a role in Venezuela's oil industry.
Jorge Rodriguez, the head of Venezuela's Congress as well as the government's delegation to the Mexico City talks, declined to comment on the issuance of the Chevron license.
Freddy Guevara, a member of the opposition coalition's delegation, said the estimated $3 billion in frozen funds intended for humanitarian relief and infrastructure projects in Venezuela would be administered by the United Nations. He cautioned that it would take time to implement the program fully. ""It begins now, but the time period is up to three years,"" he said.
The Venezuelan state funds frozen in overseas banks by sanctions are expected to be used to alleviate the country's health, food and electric-power crises in part by building infrastructure for electricity and water-treatment needs. ""Not one dollar will go to the vaults of the regime,"" Mr. Guevara said.
Chevron plans to restore lost output as it performs maintenance and other essential work, but it won't attempt major work that would require new investments in the country's oil fields until debts of $4.2 billion are repaid. That could take about two to three years depending on oil-market conditions, according to people familiar with the matter.
PdVSA owes Chevron and other joint-venture partners their shares of more than two years of revenue from oil sales, after the 2020 U.S. sanctions barred the Venezuelan company from paying its partners, one of the people said. The license would allow Chevron to collect its share of dividends from its joint ventures such as Petropiar, in which Chevron is a 30% partner.
Analysts said the new agreement raises expectations that will take time and work to fulfill. ""Ensuring the success of talks won't be easy, but it's clear that offering gradual sanctions relief like this in order to incentivize agreements is the only way forward. It's a Champagne-popping moment for the negotiators, but much more work remains to be done,"" said Geoff Ramsey, Venezuela director at the Washington Office on Latin America.

The U.S. is poised to grant a license to Chevron Corp. to pump oil in Venezuela, a policy shift that signals the easing of yearslong sanctions and could open the door for other oil companies to do business there.
The U.S. company would regain partial control of its oil-production and maintenance activities in dilapidated Venezuelan oil fields it has retained stakes in through joint ventures with state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA. It wouldn't make new investments there until certain debts are repaid, which could take years, according to people familiar with the matter.
Granting the new license is contingent on the Venezuelan government and its political opponents' announcement, expected Saturday, to implement a $3 billion humanitarian program using Venezuelan funds unfrozen by the U.S. as well as an agreement to resume talks in Mexico City next month on resolving the country's political crisis through free and fair elections, people familiar with the matter said. The talks would quickly set in motion U.S. authorization for Chevron's return to Venezuela's oil fields, according to the people.
""With the restart of the dialogue in Mexico, a road has been opened to the normalization of economic aspects of national life,"" Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said Thursday at a meeting with business executives in Caracas.
Venezuela's opposition coalition said Thursday it was ready to negotiate an agreement that would lead to a solution to Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, the establishment of rule of law, and the necessary conditions to hold free and verifiable elections.
The license, which isn't permanent and would need future renewal, would return Chevron's position in Venezuela to a sanctions framework similar to one in effect in 2019, before the Trump administration clamped down further on Chevron's activities as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign aimed at ousting the government of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.
The Wall Street Journal reported in October the Biden administration was preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime to allow Chevron to resume pumping, paving the way for a potential reopening of international markets to oil exports from Venezuela.
Reuters reported earlier that Chevron could soon win U.S. approval to vastly expand operations in Venezuela.
""We have long made clear our willingness to provide targeted relief based on concrete steps that alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people and bring them closer to a restoration of democracy,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said. ""Any step taken is done in coordination with [Venezuela's opposition coalition].""
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company was in compliance with the current sanctions framework.
The developments come just ahead of new Western sanctions on Russian oil that threaten to tighten global supplies and lift prices.
The Biden administration's move to ease sanctions on Venezuela has been seen as an effort to send a signal to markets concerned about a potential shortfall.
Any authorization provided by the Treasury Department would be time limited and would prevent PdVSA, the state-run oil company, from receiving profits from the oil sales by Chevron, according to people familiar with the matter.
The U.S. would retain the authority to amend or revoke authorizations if the Maduro regime doesn't negotiate in good faith or follow through on its commitments, the people said."

It wouldn't make new investments there until certain debts are repaid, which could take years, according to people familiar with the matter.
 Granting the new license is contingent on the Venezuelan government and its political opponents' announcement, expected Saturday, to implement a $3 billion humanitarian program using Venezuelan funds unfrozen by the U.S. as well as an agreement to resume talks in Mexico City next month on resolving the country's political crisis through free and fair elections, people familiar with the matter said. The talks would quickly set in motion U.S. authorization for Chevron's return to Venezuela's oil fields, according to the people.
""With the restart of the dialogue in Mexico, a road has been opened to the normalization of economic aspects of national life,"" Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez said Thursday at a meeting with business executives in Caracas.
In a written statement, Venezuela's coalition opposition said Thursday it was ready to negotiate an agreement that would lead to a solution to Venezuela's humanitarian crisis, the establishment of rule of law and the necessary conditions to hold free and verifiable elections.
The license, which isn't permanent and would need future renewal, would return Chevron's position in Venezuela to a sanctions framework similar to one in effect in 2019, before the Trump administration clamped down further on Chevron's activities as part of a ""maximum pressure"" campaign aimed at ousting the government of Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro.
The Wall Street Journal reported in October the Biden administration was preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime to allow Chevron to resume pumping oil there, paving the way for a potential reopening of international markets to oil exports from Venezuela.
 Reuters reported earlier that Chevron could soon win U.S. approval to vastly expand operations in Venezuela.
""We have long made clear our willingness to provide targeted relief based on concrete steps that alleviate the suffering of the Venezuelan people and bring them closer to a restoration of democracy,"" a spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council said. ""Any step taken is done in coordination with [Venezuela's opposition coalition].""
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the company was in compliance with the current sanctions framework.
The developments come just ahead of new Western sanctions on Russian oil that threaten to tighten global supplies and lift prices. The Biden administration's move to ease sanctions on Venezuela has been seen as an effort to send a well-timed psychological signal to markets concerned about a potential future shortfall.
""With the price cap on Russian oil, supply is most likely going to be constrained further,"" said Ali Moshiri, a former Chevron executive who oversaw the expansion of the company's operations in Latin America and worked closely with Venezuelan officials. ""Additional supply has to come from other sources, and Venezuela can be one of those sources that brings additional supplies.""
Mr. Moshiri is working as a consultant for Chevron in Venezuela.
At the expected meeting Saturday between the Maduro regime and Venezuela's opposition coalition, known as the Unitary Platform, the parties are likely to announce an agreement on using about $3 billion of Venezuelan state funds frozen in overseas banks by sanctions to procure humanitarian aid and rebuild critical infrastructure for electricity and water- treatment needs, according to people familiar with the matter.
Also expected is an announcement that they will begin meeting in December to develop a timeline and framework to usher in political changes and hold presidential elections by 2024, the people said.
Any authorization provided by the Treasury Department would be time-limited and would prevent PdVSA, the state-run oil company, from receiving profits from the oil sales by Chevron, according to people familiar with the matter. The U.S. would retain the authority to amend or revoke authorizations if the Maduro regime doesn't negotiate in good faith or follow through on its commitments, the people said.
For the Biden administration, U.S. domestic political blowback over the policy change is seen as manageable after the midterm elections , said people familiar with the matter, partly because Florida, whose large Cuban and Venezuelan communities support Venezuelan sanctions, is now seen as lost to the Republican Party .
Inside Venezuela, the imminent breakthrough foreshadows the formal end of an ""interim government"" led by Juan Guaidó, a U.S.-backed opposition leader whose fragile political mandate will lapse in early January.
On Thursday, the Norwegian embassy in Mexico said the Maduro government and the Venezuelan opposition coalition would meet Saturday and sign a ""partial agreement"" on implementing social programs. Norway has brokered previous talks between the Maduro government and its opponents.
Once it is allowed to return to Venezuelan oil fields and associated oil-processing plants under a new, roughly 1,000-page contract that it was allowed to negotiate with PdVSA, Chevron faces challenges that could limit its ability to increase production quickly. Those include managing everything from fuel shortages to accident-prone oil infrastructure to security and corruption risks.
Some analysts have said Venezuela's oil production is likely to hit a ceiling of about 1 million barrels a day in the medium term. Venezuela now produces about 700,000 barrels a day, compared with more than 3 million barrels a day in the 1990s.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said recently in a television interview that it would take months and years to refurbish oil fields and equipment and mobilize workers to help lift production. ""It wouldn't be an instantaneous effect,"" he said.
Europe's Repsol SA and ENI SpA, and India's Reliance, are among non-U. S. oil companies monitoring developments in anticipation of also re-engaging with Venezuela. Others monitoring events include Venezuela's creditors looking to initiate a debt restructuring by next year.

The world's largest oil companies continue to reap rewards from sustained high commodity prices as Exxon Mobil Corp. reported almost $20 billion in profit, its most lucrative quarter ever, while rival Chevron Corp. reported just a slight dip from the record haul it set in the prior quarter.
Despite the hefty profits and high energy prices, the two largest U.S. oil companies didn't telegraph any plans Friday to increase spending on oil or fuel production, sticking to their annual budget ranges that were set before the war in Ukraine caused a spike in energy prices as supplies drained globally.
Exxon's third-quarter earnings climbed about 10% from the previous quarter, which also set a profit record at the time. It said investments over the past five years were yielding rewards, including spending following the onset of the pandemic when many peers pulled back.
Chevron's third-quarter profit slipped about 3% to $11.2 billion from its all-time high in the second quarter due to net charges in the quarter of more than $600 million. Without those charges, it would have also hit record earnings.
Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said he doesn't expect the company next year to deviate from its spending guidance, which is well below prepandemic levels.
""We will, on the margin, spend money where we can see an opportunity,"" Mr. Woods told analysts Friday. ""Our plans going forward are still very consistent with [previously disclosed budget] ranges.""
After it too hit a profit record last quarter, Shell PLC said Thursday its third-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis, a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report, was $8.3 billion, down $3.2 billion from the prior quarter. The London-based oil major said it would boost its dividend and buy back an additional $4 billion of its shares in coming months.
High prices at the pump have spurred President Biden and Democrats in Congress to criticize oil companies for their historic profits and press them to put out more gasoline and diesel. Energy prices have emerged as a key campaign issue ahead of midterm elections early next month.
On Friday, in response to Exxon increasing its quarterly dividend, Mr. Biden tweeted, ""Can't believe I have to say this but giving profits to shareholders is not the same as bringing prices down for American families.""
Many oil companies are in the process of drafting capital spending budgets for next year, and few are signaling dramatic increases so far. Chevron is poised to boost capital spending 20% next year compared with 2022, well below prepandemic levels and within the five-year spending range it previously provided. The company is expected to spend around $15 billion this year. ""We have productive conversations with the [Biden] administration and share their objective of stable and affordable energy resources,"" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview. ""But at the same time, we're making decisions in the long-term interest of our shareholders.""
Exxon's stock price closed about 3% higher Friday, while Chevron shares rose about 1%.
The Biden administration has urged oil companies to boost their refining capacity to make more gasoline and diesel, as inventories languished at the lowest levels in over a decade. Globally, refining capacity has fallen by almost 3 million barrels a day since 2020, with the U.S. down about 800,000 barrels a day.

As Biden officials consider relaxing sanctions to allow Chevron Corp. to pump oil in Venezuela again, the company is preparing to navigate myriad challenges in the country that could limit its ability to quickly increase production.
Chevron will have to manage everything from fuel shortages to accident-prone oil infrastructure to security and corruption risks that could hamper its efforts to revitalize the country's gutted oil industry.
On the optimistic side, some analysts said Venezuela's oil production could increase by about 400,000 barrels a day in a matter of months to a year -- not nearly enough to offset up to 2 million barrels of daily production the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies said they would cut Wednesday.
Venezuela is likely to eventually hit a ceiling of about 1 million barrels a day in the medium term, still well below production levels before the U.S. sanctions, said Fernando Ferreira, an analyst at Rapidan Energy.
""To get above that level would be challenging,"" Mr. Ferreira said. ""They'll have to do a lot of refurbishing of the oil infrastructure, and that would require a lot of investment.""
The Biden administration is discussing scaling down sanctions on Venezuela's regime, if authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro agrees to negotiate with the U.S.-backed opposition to organize free and fair presidential elections in 2024 and commits to other changes, according to people familiar with the matter.
Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, said it didn't have plans to change the sanctions policy without constructive steps from the Maduro government. Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr didn't comment on the challenges Chevron would face if sanctions were eased but said the company is in compliance with the current sanctions framework.
U.S. officials hope Chevron, Venezuela's state-run PdVSA and other producers can quickly extract more crude from long-neglected oil fields to help replenish tight global oil supplies that have lagged behind demand and kept energy prices elevated this year. But in the near term, that may be difficult, experts say.
Chevron in 2020 wrote down its Venezuelan assets, taking a charge of $2.6 billion, just months after the Trump administration increased sanctions that barred American companies from drilling, transporting or selling Venezuelan crude.
The speed at which Chevron could restart operations in Venezuela, primarily in the country's Orinoco heavy oil belt in the east, will hinge largely on how quickly modifications to the Trump-era sanctions can be implemented.
For example, since the U.S. imposed oil sanctions, the country has struggled to get enough diluents, liquids that ease the flow of Venezuela's viscous oil, once primarily sourced from the U.S. Without that, Chevron will struggle to increase production by much, analysts said. PdVSA has resorted to using condensate from Iran, considered a less efficient diluent than naphtha from U.S. refineries.
Another major problem that projects face is the severe shortage of qualified professionals, according to Ivan Freites, a veteran oil-workers union leader and critic of Mr. Maduro. Political persecution and the economic meltdown in recent years have pushed tens of thousands of oil engineers, geologists and welders out of the country. They are part of the 6.8 million people that, according to the United Nations, have fled Venezuela during Mr. Maduro's tumultuous tenure.
In addition, the once-thriving Venezuelan oil industry has been plagued by rampant looting, with local communities and even desperate laborers pillaging installations for everything from copper wiring to pumps to pipes for scrap metal. One of Chevron's joint ventures in the country, Petroboscan, which produces oil used to make asphalt, has been a prime target for theft, the union leader said.
Chevron's larger venture, Petropiar, where Venezuela's tar-like heavy oil is mixed with diluents to make it easier to transport, has also been hounded by allegations that PdVSA's managers in the project robbed it of hundreds of millions of dollars through rigged tenders, kickbacks and overpriced supplies. Those accusations have led to scores of arrests in the past during antigraft crusades led by Mr. Maduro. Many of the president's closest allies, as well as military honchos, continue to hold senior positions in the oil industry.
""We want people to be able to work and live better, so if a company like Chevron wants to come back, I think that's great,"" said Mr. Freites. ""But when you look at the dire situation in the sector today, it's not going to be easy to operate.""
Luis Pacheco, PdVSA's former corporate planning director and current nonresident fellow at the Baker Institute Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, only sees Chevron producing 100,000 extra barrels a day of crude oil in a few months and 200,000 more in 24 months. He points to technical challenges such as rising water leaks in aging oil fields and unstable electricity supply.
""The technical problems are solvable with time and money,"" Mr. Pacheco said. ""But the extra oil is really marginal.""
Chevron has been operating in Venezuela for a century and built a close relationship with the leftist government that has ruled there for more than two decades. During the first 25 days of September, it produced about 45,000 barrels a day, including about 27,680 barrels a day from its Petropiar venture, according to consulting firm IPD Latin America. If sanctions were lifted, Chevron would aim to lift its output to almost 200,000 barrels a day in about a year, according to people familiar with the matter.
All told, Venezuela's production was about 686,000 barrels a day in the first 25 days of September, down from more than 900,000 in December, according to IPD Latin America.
Projections of how much extra oil Venezuela can produce vary widely, partly because of the many unknowns in Chevron's new 1,000-page contract with PdVSA that it hopes to implement, and the breadth of pending U.S. licenses."

| Jump to first hitEl gobierno de Biden se está preparando para reducir las sanciones al régimen autoritario de Venezuela con el fin de permitir que Chevron Corp. reanude el bombeo de petróleo allí, allanando el camino para una potencial reapertura de los mercados estadounidenses y europeos a las exportaciones de petróleo de Venezuela, según personas relacionadas con la propuesta.A cambio del significativo alivio de las sanciones, el gobierno del presidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro reanudaría las conversaciones suspendidas durante mucho tiempo con la oposición del país para discutir las condiciones necesarias para celebrar elecciones presidenciales libres y justas en 2024, señalaron las personas. Además, Estados Unidos, el gobierno de Venezuela y algunas figuras de la oposición venezolana han elaborado un acuerdo que liberaría cientos de millones de dólares en fondos estatales venezolanos congelados en bancos estadounidenses para pagar las importaciones de alimentos, medicamentos y equipos para la maltrecha red eléctrica y los sistemas municipales de agua del país.Por su parte, funcionarios estadounidenses aseguraron que los detalles aún se están discutiendo y advirtieron que el acuerdo podría fracasar, ya que depende de que los principales ayudantes de Maduro reanuden las conversaciones con la oposición de buena fe.“No hay planes para cambiar nuestra política de sanciones sin pasos constructivos por parte del régimen de Maduro”, dijo Adrienne Watson, representante del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional.Si el acuerdo se lleva a cabo y a Chevron, junto con las empresas de servicios petroleros de Estados Unidos, se les permite trabajar de nuevo en Venezuela, sólo pondría una cantidad limitada de nuevo petróleo en el mercado mundial en el corto plazo.Venezuela fue una vez un importante productor de petróleo, bombeando más de 3,2 millones de barriles al día durante los 90, pero la industria estatal ha colapsado en la última década debido a la falta de inversión, la corrupción y la mala gestión. En su momento, las sanciones impuestas por el gobierno de Trump perjudicaron aún más la producción y obligaron a las empresas occidentales a abandonar el país.Cualquier cambio en la política de EE.UU., que haga volver a las compañías petroleras occidentales, enviaría una señal psicológica al mercado de que hay más oferta en camino, señalaron las fuentes. La noticia de un posible acercamiento de Estados Unidos a Venezuela surge justo cuando los países de la OPEP+, liderados por Arabia Saudita y Rusia, acordaron reducir la producción en respuesta a la caída de los precios del petróleo, lo que enfureció al gobierno de Biden.Sin embargo, el acercamiento a Venezuela, que cuenta con algunas de las mayores reservas de petróleo del mundo, podría servir como una estrategia a más largo plazo para Estados Unidos y los países europeos que tratan de asegurar nuevas fuentes de energía mientras la guerra de Rusia en Ucrania se prolonga y trastorna los mercados de materias primas, sostuvo Francisco Monaldi, un experto en energía de América Latina de la Universidad de Rice.“Si los precios del petróleo bajan, todo esto podría cambiar”, aseguró Monaldi. “Pero por ahora, esta es su obsesión” agregó.El acuerdo entre Estados Unidos y Venezuela, cuyos términos se espera que se refuercen a fin de mes, es la última señal de que Washington está dispuesto a reducir la campaña de presión contra el gobierno de Maduro que heredó del gobierno de Trump.Ahora, hay potenciales trampas. La propuesta está avivando la furia entre algunos de los enemigos más estridentes del régimen, que dicen que la estrategia permitiría a Maduro mantener su control autoritario sobre el país con pocas concesiones. Por otra parte, podría ser impopular entre algunos en el gobierno de Maduro.“Dentro del régimen, tienes a los de línea dura que son muy críticos con el giro neoliberal de Maduro”, señaló Geoff Ramsey, director del programa de Venezuela en la Oficina de Washington para América Latina. “Y dentro de la oposición, tienes actores que están muy interesados en hacer todo lo posible para continuar con el gobierno interino”, explicó.A su vez, algunos líderes de la oposición venezolana dijeron que el dinero fresco podría incentivar a Maduro, cuyo gobierno en los últimos años ha eludido las sanciones de Estados Unidos mediante la venta de su crudo pesado a China y otros compradores asiáticos con grandes descuentos.El representante de Chevron, Ray Fohr, no comentó sobre el acuerdo propuesto, pero dijo que en Venezuela “tenemos inversiones dedicadas y una gran fuerza de trabajo que dependen de nuestra presencia”. Comentó también que la compañía cumple con el actual marco de sanciones.Ali Moshiri, un exejecutivo de Chevron que supervisó la expansión de las operaciones de la empresa en América Latina y trabajó estrechamente con funcionarios venezolanos, indicó que el cambio del gobierno de Biden parece reflejar la presión política que ha surgido con el aumento de los precios de la energía y la escasez de suministros mundiales.“Tiene mucho sentido que el equipo de Biden relaje algunas de las sanciones hacia Venezuela, para permitir que múltiples recursos nos ayuden a bajar los precios de la energía”, señaló Moshiri, quien estima que el país podría alcanzar 1,5 millones de barriles diarios de producción en dos años si Chevron y otras empresas llegan a trabajar libremente.Las conversaciones entre funcionarios de EE.UU. y Venezuela han estado en marcha en silencio desde al menos marzo, pero cobraron impulso cuando el país latinoamericano liberó el sábado a seis ciudadanos estadounidenses y a un residente permanente de EE.UU. que habían sido encarcelados allí. A cambio, Estados Unidos liberó a dos hombres -sobrinos de la primera dama venezolana Cilia Flores- que habían sido condenados por tráfico de drogas.Un funcionario estadounidense comentó que el intercambio creó algunas “nuevas oportunidades” entre las dos partes que no existían hace una semana.Las empresas de Wall Street y los inversores estadounidenses también llevaban meses presionando al gobierno de Biden para que levantara las sanciones con el fin de recuperar miles de millones de dólares en deuda y cerrar acuerdos comerciales con Caracas. Las sanciones más duras llegaron en 2019, cuando Estados Unidos y decenas de sus aliados declararon que el líder opositor Juan Guaidó era el presidente legítimo de Venezuela. Su movimiento, sin embargo, no logró derrocar a Maduro, y la mayoría de los países ahora tratan abiertamente con el gobierno de Maduro.Por su parte, el representante de Guaidó no hizo comentarios. El líder de la oposición ha dicho que no tuvo nada que ver con el reciente intercambio de prisioneros y se opone a la disminución de la presión sobre Maduro.La Oficina de Control de Activos Extranjeros del Departamento del Tesoro de EE.UU., que administra las sanciones contra Venezuela, se está preparando para emitir una o más licencias para que Chevron ejecute sus cuatro proyectos petroleros de empresa conjunta existentes con la compañía petrolera estatal, Petróleos de Venezuela SA, o PdVSA. El acuerdo de Chevron con Venezuela le otorga un control operativo total y consta de unas 1.000 páginas, según fuentes relacionadas con el documento.Con Chevron a cargo de todos los aspectos de los proyectos, y con la autorización de EE.UU. para exportar petróleo, Venezuela podría recuperar la relevancia en el mercado petrolero de la que gozaba a principios de la década del 2000, cuando era uno de los principales exportadores de crudo a EE.UU. El país exporta ahora unos 450.000 barriles al día y podría duplicar esa cifra en cuestión de meses, según personas relacionadas con la industria petrolera de Venezuela y que son optimistas sobre sus perspectivas.El Departamento del Tesoro y el Departamento de Estado no hicieron comentarios al respecto. Tampoco hubo una respuesta por parte de la compañía petrolera estatal de Venezuela y su Ministerio de Información, con respecto a los correos electrónicos recibidos pidiendo información.Entre los proyectos potencialmente importantes en Venezuela se encuentra el yacimiento de gas en alta mar de Perla, operado por Repsol SA de España y ENI SpA de Italia. Shell también está supervisando el progreso de un posible acercamiento entre Estados Unidos y Venezuela para implementar un acuerdo preliminar de gas en alta mar frente al este de Venezuela que abastecería una planta de licuefacción en la vecina Trinidad y Tobago, según personas relacionadas con la compañía.Ahora bien, los proyectos de gas son especialmente relevantes en el mismo momento en que Europa intenta sustituir el suministro de gas cortado de Rusia de cara al invierno.“Podría producirse un efecto dominó en cuanto a la puesta en marcha”, aseguró Monaldi, que es venezolano. Pero añadió que los yacimientos petrolíferos están tan deteriorados por la falta de inversión que Venezuela tendría dificultades para aumentar significativamente la producción en los próximos dos años, incluso con la ayuda de empresas extranjeras.“No creo que sea relevante para los mercados energéticos, en general, a corto y mediano plazo”, concluyó Monaldi.CREDIT: Vivian Salama de The Wall Street Journal"

In addition, the once-thriving Venezuelan oil industry has been plagued by looting, with local communities and even desperate laborers pillaging installations for everything from copper wiring to pumps to pipes for scrap metal. One of Chevron's joint ventures in the country, Petroboscan, which produces oil used to make asphalt, has been a prime target for theft, the union leader said.
Chevron's larger venture, Petropiar, where Venezuela's tar-like heavy oil is mixed with diluents to make it easier to transport, has faced allegations that PDVSA's managers in the project robbed it of hundreds of millions of dollars through rigged tenders, kickbacks and overpriced supplies. Those accusations have led to scores of arrests in the past during antigraft crusades led by Mr. Maduro. Many of the president's closest allies, as well as military leaders, continue to hold senior positions in the oil industry.
""We want people to be able to work and live better, so if a company like Chevron wants to come back, I think that's great,"" said Mr. Freites. ""But when you look at the dire situation in the sector today, it's not going to be easy to operate.""
Luis Pacheco, PDVSA's former corporate planning executive director and current nonresident fellow at the Baker Institute Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, only sees Chevron producing 100,000 extra barrels a day of crude oil in a few months and 200,000 more in 24 months. He points to technical challenges such as rising water leaks in aging oil fields and unstable electricity supply.
""The technical problems are solvable with time and money,"" Mr. Pacheco said. ""But the extra oil is really marginal.""
Chevron has been operating in Venezuela for about a century and built a close relationship with the leftist government that has ruled there for more than two decades. During the first 25 days of September, it produced about 45,000 barrels a day, including about 27,680 barrels a day from its Petropiar venture, according to the consulting firm IPD Latin America. If sanctions were lifted, Chevron would aim to lift its output to almost 200,000 barrels a day in about a year, according to people familiar with the matter.
All told, Venezuela's production was about 686,000 barrels a day in the first 25 days of September, down from more than 900,000 barrels a day in December, according to IPD Latin America.
Projections of how much extra oil Venezuela can produce vary widely, partly because of the many unknowns in Chevron's new 1,000-page contract with PDVSA that it hopes to implement, and the breadth of pending U.S. licenses.
Among the many institutional and financial unknowns is whether a new license would restrict oil-sales revenue to pay down PDVSA's accumulated joint-venture arrears to Chevron, or whether the U.S. oil major would pay a royalty directly to the Maduro government, according to Luisa Palacios, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy.
Despite the limited upside for Chevron in the near term, Mr. Pacheco said: ""There is a lot of corporate pride there. They went in deep with the government, lent money to Venezuela, did a lot of lobbying, so they have a legitimate interest in going back.""

The Biden administration is preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela's authoritarian regime to allow Chevron Corp. to resume pumping oil there, paving the way for a potential reopening of U.S. and European markets to oil exports from Venezuela, according to people familiar with the proposal.
In exchange for the significant sanctions relief, the government of President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela would resume long-suspended talks with the country's opposition to discuss conditions needed to hold free and fair presidential elections in 2024, the people said. The U.S., Venezuela's government and some Venezuelan opposition figures have also worked out a deal that would free up hundreds of millions of dollars in Venezuelan state funds frozen in U.S. banks to pay for imports of food, medicine and equipment for the country's battered electricity grid and municipal water systems.
U.S. officials said details are still under discussion and cautioned the deal could fall through, since it is contingent on Mr. Maduro's aides resuming talks with the opposition in good faith.
""There are no plans to change our sanctions policy without constructive steps from the Maduro regime,"" said Adrienne Watson, spokesperson for the National Security Council.
If the deal goes through and Chevron and U.S. oil service companies are allowed to work in Venezuela again, it would put only a limited amount of new oil on the world market in the short term.
Venezuela was once a major oil producer, pumping more than 3.2 million barrels a day in the 1990s, but the state-run industry has collapsed over the past decade because of underinvestment, corruption and mismanagement. Sanctions leveled by the Trump administration further dented production and forced Western companies out of the country.
Any shift in U.S. policy that brings back Western oil companies would send a psychological signal to the market that more supply is on the way, the people said. Word of a possible U.S. rapprochement with Venezuela is emerging just as OPEC+ countries led by Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to slash production in response to sagging oil prices, angering the Biden administration.
But engaging Venezuela, which sits atop some of the world's largest oil reserves, could serve as a longer-term strategy for the U.S. and European countries scrambling to secure new energy sources as Russia's war in Ukraine drags on and upends commodities markets, said Francisco Monaldi, a Latin America energy expert at Rice University.
""If [oil] prices come down, this all could change,"" Mr. Monaldi said, ""but for now, this is their obsession.""
The U.S.-Venezuela proposed agreement, the terms of which are expected to be shored up later this month, is the latest sign that Washington is willing to wind down a pressure campaign against the Maduro government that it inherited from the Trump administration.
There are potential pitfalls. The proposal is stoking fury among some of the regime's most strident foes, who said the strategy would allow Mr. Maduro to maintain his authoritarian grip on the country with few concessions. On the other hand, it could be unpopular among some in the Maduro administration.
""Inside the regime, you have hard-liners who are very critical of Maduro's neoliberal turn,"" said Geoff Ramsey, director of the Venezuela program at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""And within the opposition, you have players who are very interested in doing everything possible to continue the interim government.""
Some Venezuelan opposition leaders said fresh cash could embolden Mr. Maduro, whose government in recent years has circumvented U.S. sanctions by selling its heavy crude oil to China and other Asian buyers at steep discounts.
Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr didn't comment on the proposed deal, but said that in Venezuela, ""we have dedicated investments and a large workforce who are dependent on our presence."" He said the company is in compliance with the current sanctions framework.
Ali Moshiri, a former Chevron executive who oversaw the expansion of the company's operations in Latin America and worked closely with Venezuelan officials, said the Biden administration's shift appears to reflect political pressure that has come with rising energy prices and tight global supplies.
""It makes a lot of sense that the Biden administration relaxes some of the sanctions toward Venezuela, to allow multiple resources to help us lower energy prices,"" said Mr. Moshiri, who estimated the country could reach 1.5 million barrels a day of output in two years if Chevron and other companies can work freely.
Talks between officials from the U.S. and Venezuela have been quietly under way since at least March, but gained momentum when Venezuela on Saturday released six U.S. citizens and one U.S. permanent resident who had been jailed in that country. In exchange, the U.S. released two men -- nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores -- who had been convicted of drug trafficking.
A U.S. official said the swap created some ""new opportunities"" between the two sides that didn't exist a week ago.
Wall Street firms and U.S. investors had for months also been pressing the Biden administration to lift sanctions to recover billions of dollars in debt and strike business deals with Caracas. The toughest sanctions came in 2019, when the U.S. and dozens of its allies declared opposition leader Juan Guaido was Venezuela's legitimate president. His movement failed to oust Mr. Maduro, and most countries now openly deal with the Maduro government.
A spokesman for Mr. Guaido didn't respond to questions seeking comment. The opposition leader has said he opposes easing pressure on Mr. Maduro.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which administers sanctions against Venezuela, is preparing to issue one or more licenses for Chevron to run its four existing joint venture oil projects with the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Chevron's agreement with Venezuela gives it full operational control and runs about 1,000 pages, people familiar with the document said.
With Chevron in charge of the projects, and the U.S. clearing the export of oil, Venezuela could regain the relevance in the oil market that it enjoyed in the early 2000s. The country now exports about 450,000 barrels a day and could double it in a matter of months, said people who are familiar with Venezuela's oil industry and are bullish about its prospects.
The Treasury and State departments didn't reply to requests to comment. Venezuela's state oil company and Information Ministry didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

Shell is also monitoring the progress of a possible U.S.-Venezuela rapprochement to implement a preliminary offshore gas deal off eastern Venezuela that would supply a liquefaction plant in neighboring Trinidad and Tobago, according to people familiar with the company.
The gas projects are especially relevant at the same time Europe is trying to replace severed gas supply from Russia ahead of winter.
""There could be a domino effect there in terms of getting things going,"" said Mr. Monaldi, who is Venezuelan. But he added that the oil fields are so deteriorated from underinvestment that Venezuela would be hard-pressed to add significantly to output over the next two years, even with the help of foreign companies.
""I don't think it would be relevant to broader energy markets in the near and medium term,"" he said.

Chevron Corp. has sold its current headquarters in California and plans to move into a nearby leased space about one-third of the size, as it continues to relocate employees to Texas.
The second-largest U.S. oil company closed the sale Wednesday of its Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, Calif., its global headquarters for two decades, to Sunset Development Co. The family-run company had originally sold the 92-acre parcel to Chevron in the early 1980s.
Sunset Chief Executive Alex Mehran Jr. said Chevron also signed a lease for nearly 400,000 square feet of space in a nearby office building located in Sunset's Bishop Ranch mixed-use project in San Ramon. Chevron's office space there could house about 2,000 employees after interior construction finishes in late 2023, Sunset said.
The financial terms of the sale and the lease agreement weren't disclosed. A Chevron spokesman said the current real-estate market gave the company an opportunity to downsize its office space to the size its employee base there requires.
Chevron's main offices have resided in California for more than 140 years. It has housed its main offices in the greater Bay Area since the early days of its first corporate ancestor, Pacific Coast Oil Co., in 1879. It moved hundreds of employees to San Ramon in 1999 and in the early 2000s said it would become the company's headquarters.
But its presence in California has been declining for years, particularly following a reorganization that began in 2019. Some of Chevron's leaders have long wanted to move the company's headquarters to Texas, but it has held off largely because of its history in California and its assets there, such as its Richmond, Calif., refinery, said people familiar with the matter.
""Chevron will remain headquartered in California,"" spokesman Braden Reddall said.
The sale of Chevron's global headquarters cements its shift to house the bulk of its U.S. workforce in downtown Houston, where its employee population has grown to about 6,000, about three times the size of its head count in San Ramon. Chevron had said this year that it would offer to cover costs for some employees to relocate to Houston.
Mr. Reddall said about 200 employees elected to move to Houston since Chevron made that offer in the summer.
Mr. Mehran, whose company has worked with Chevron for decades, said that many people have wrongly predicted for years that Chevron would move its actual headquarters to Houston, and that its most recent real-estate investment in the leased space in San Ramon shows the company intends to remain based in California."

The sale of Chevron's global headquarters cements its shift to house the bulk of its U.S. workforce in downtown Houston, where its employee population has grown to about 6,000, about three times the size of its head count in San Ramon. Chevron had said earlier this year that it would offer to cover costs for some employees to relocate to Houston.
Mr. Reddall said about 200 employees elected to move to Houston since Chevron made that offer earlier in the summer.
Mr. Mehran, whose company has worked with Chevron for decades, said that many people have wrongly predicted for years that Chevron would move its actual headquarters to Houston, and that its most recent real-estate investment in the leased space in San Ramon shows the company intends to remain based in California.
""It's the most written-about story that has never happened,"" Mr. Mehran said of the idea Chevron will decamp from California for Houston. ""As much as they can be more efficient in Houston, they have an enduring presence in California.""
Houston has become the capital of the U.S. oil-and-natural-gas industry over the past several decades, with Texas leaders including Gov. Greg Abbott touting lower taxes and a lighter regulatory burden on businesses compared with California and other states. Texas doesn't have a state income tax, and its real estate is generally less expensive than in California.
Rival Exxon Mobil Corp. is moving its headquarters from Irving, Texas, to the Houston area next year.
The office building Chevron is moving into in San Ramon will have restaurants, a gym, a conference center and other amenities. As for what will become of Chevron Park, Mr. Mehran said he would have to work through that over the coming months with city and community leaders and others.
Mary Boroughs, president of Chevron Environmental Management and Real Estate Company, said the company's move to a new, modern leased space will offer an improved employee experience in a more contemporary environment.
Chevron's move follows recent similar decisions by other large U.S. companies to downsize their main offices. Many businesses have cut back on real estate as more workers station themselves at home for part of the workweek, while some employees have moved across state lines to capture cheaper housing and costs of living as well as lower taxes offered by some states.
KPMG LLP said last month that it would move to smaller offices in New York. Yelp Inc. said this summer that it would close offices in New York, Chicago and Washington. Others that have recently announced moves include machinery giant Caterpillar Inc., aerospace company Boeing Co. and defense contractor Raytheon Technologies Corp.

A conservative activist turned investor who has criticized Wall Street's efforts to address climate change and other issues is publicly urging Chevron Corp. to pump more fossil fuels during the next decade.
Vivek Ramaswamy, who launched an energy-focused exchange-traded fund nearly a month ago, is among the most prominent critics of environmental, social and governance -- or ESG -- investing. He quickly turned his sights on Chevron, arguing the country's second-biggest fossil-fuel company should slow spending on its energy-transition plan, which he said was partially motivated by pressure from top shareholders such as BlackRock Inc.
In the letter Tuesday to Chevron CEO Mike Wirth and the company's board, Mr. Ramaswamy said he wants to ""liberate you from constraints imposed on Chevron by its ESG-promoting 'shareholders.'"" Mr. Ramaswamy writes that he looks forward to engaging with the company before next year's proxy voting season. The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the letter.
Chevron didn't respond to a request for comment.
The author of ""Woke, Inc."", a book arguing businesses shouldn't be affected by politics, Mr. Ramaswamy invested in Chevron through his Strive Asset Management's ETF nearly a month ago. The ETF tracks an index of energy stocks. Strive, which counts investor Bill Ackman and tech executive Peter Thiel among its backers, is part of a pushback by conservatives against ESG investing. The fund has hit about $315 million in assets, a strong start for a new offering.
The Chevron effort is a response to last year's proxy victory by hedge fund Engine No. 1 at Chevron rival Exxon Mobil Corp. that forced Exxon to accelerate energy-transition efforts. Strive's letter calls for energy producers to dump their current strategy of limiting investments and returning cash to shareholders. It is one of the first formal calls for an oil giant to do so.
Mr. Ramaswamy, whose fund holds a roughly 0.02% stake in Chevron, likely would need support from large shareholders who generally have embraced Chevron's current strategy to get the company to change course. He is unique in targeting a company that is posting stock-price gains and record profit. High oil-and-gas prices have lifted Chevron shares about 35% this year.
A former pharmaceutical executive, Mr. Ramaswamy says Chevron could earn a higher valuation relative to earnings if it addresses possible supply shortages during the next decade. That approach is more appropriate than limiting output and devoting resources to the energy transition, he says.
Large index-fund providers BlackRock, State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group own about 20% of Chevron. The asset managers previously have responded to criticism of ESG -- the loosely defined practice of considering issues beyond short-term profits when making financial decisions -- by saying companies that manage environmental risks and opportunities will be the most profitable over time. They don't always oppose energy companies increasing fossil-fuel output and don't always take the same stances on company proposals.
Heavy long-term spending on fossil fuels when demand is expected to fall in the decades ahead is a failing strategy, say many investors and analysts.
Mr. Ramaswamy's letter marks a new front in this year's war over ESG. Republican-led states such as Florida and Texas recently have taken steps to move their investments and retirement funds away from some Wall Street firms. Both sides have accused the other of being anti free market and inserting political views into business.
Mr. Ramaswamy is counting on large shareholders such as Warren Buffett to help Chevron shift its strategy. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is Chevron's largest individual shareholder with a roughly 8% stake it has built as part of recent bets on U.S. oil companies, FactSet data show.
The letter says that the legendary investor's independent thinking and opposition to ESG-disclosure proposals at Berkshire last year could make it easier for Chevron to fight the biggest Wall Street firms.
The letter comes as the energy industry enjoys boom times but faces an uncertain future. Chevron, based in San Ramon, Calif., and which had $11.6 billion in second-quarter profit, last year pledged to triple its low-carbon investments to $10 billion through 2028. Chevron in March said its capital spending would range from $15 billion to $17 billion annually through 2026.
CEO since February 2018, Mr. Wirth has said he plans for the company to continue raking in cash from fossil fuels, while strategically investing in parts of the energy transition where the company has expertise. Many of those just became more attractive investments thanks to tax credits that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act. The company bought sustainable fuels company Renewable Energy Group for $3.15 billion earlier this year and has many startup bets tied to the energy transition."
