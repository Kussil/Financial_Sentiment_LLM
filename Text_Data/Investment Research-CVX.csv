exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $173.35
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $182, raised $12, reflects a 6x multiple of enterprise value to
projected '23 EBITDA, about in line with CVX's historical forward average. We cut our '22 EPS
estimate by $0.52 to $18.36, but raise '23's by $0.73 to $17.90. CVX reports Q3 earnings on 10/28,
and we think results will yield earnings power ($4.88 per share) that easily beats the year-ago
numbers, but fall short of Q2 levels. This is in no small part due to the recent pullback in crude oil
prices, as we note that West Texas Intermediate averaged almost $110 per barrel in Q2, but just
$93 per barrel in Q3. Thus, upstream profitability should show sequential pullback. However, we also
see a sequential improvement in downstream profitability, as the Brent-WTI spread has gotten
markedly wider, and U.S. diesel inventories look remarkably low of late.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $109.24
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $109, an 8.5x multiple of price to projected '21 operating cash flow,
below CVX's historical average. We keep our 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates at $4.20 and $5.55,
respectively. CVX held its 2021 Investor Day event today, and the near-term outlook keeps a
conservative approach to upstream capex (similar to others in the industry). CVX cited a capex
budget of $14B in 2021 versus 2020's $13B, and shifting to a range of $14B-$16B in 2022-2025.
We estimate CVX's capex/boe in 2011-2020 of about 80% higher than in 2001-2010; thus, a
targeted goal of doubling ROCE (2020-2025) is likely to come with the trade-off of low production
growth. We see the Permian taking on a bigger share of overall upstream production by 2025, which
also means fighting a sizable decline curve, so being more efficient with capex dollars will likely be
key. Finally, we see more efforts around carbon reduction, with a planned $3B in this area trying to
keep pace with rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 60 ***), in our view.

Recent Price : $151.94
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target of $160, cut $2, reflects a 5.8x multiple of enterprise value to projected '25
EBITDA, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We think a modest discount is merited by
CVX's exposure to California refining, which is important to CVX's overall downstream capacity, and
is also where we see headwinds looming in '24. We cut our '24 EPS view $1.57 to $12.55 and set
'25's at $13.20. Q4 EPS of $3.45 vs. $4.09, beat the consensus view by $0.23. We are also taking a
more pessimistic tone to our outlook for energy prices through '25. We see WTI prices flat to down
vs. the $78/b average in '22, and see only modest improvement in natural gas pricing. CVX remains
cost disciplined, and in '23 allocated more capital to dividends and buybacks ($26B) than it did for
total capex ($16B). CVX should still obtain production growth via the Permian Basin and Guyana
(the latter once the Hess Corp. [HES 146 ***] acquisition closes), but we think the near-term
macroeconomic outlook will be difficult.

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we positively view
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

the company's size and breadth of operations across the

BUY FROM HOLD
Recent Price : $112.05
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $125, raised $16, reflects a 7.3x multiple of projected '22 operating
cash flow, about in line with CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.82
to $7.27, and '22's by $1.50 to $8.57. CVX reports Q3 earnings tomorrow, and we think that the
company will deliver solid year over year improvement in its upstream segments, both domestic and
international. On the international side, we note that CVX is fairly balanced between liquids and
natural gas, and with the sharp spike in overseas natural gas prices recently, we think CVX could
benefit to a high degree. We will also be interested to see any indications over preliminary budgets
for '22 and the degree to which it invests incrementally more on energy transition. We expect CVX to
maintain its quarterly dividend ($1.34/share), which we estimate implies a '22 payout ratio of 63%,
roughly in line with that of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 64 ****), and defendable in our view.

Chevron Corporation
Symbol: CVX
CFRA LIFTS VIEW ON SHARES OF CHEVRON TO BUY FROM HOLD
Recent Price : $115.93
Recommendation:
We raise our 12-month target price by $5, to $133, reflecting an 8X multiple of price to projected
'19 operating cash flow, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We note that, since the
beginning of February, estimated operating cash flow in '19 has risen 15% even as the stock price is
essentially flat. We lift our '19 EPS estimate by $0.68 to $7.33, and '20's by $0.49 to $8.47. CVX
continues to build out its Permian franchise, along with deepwater prospects, and LNG. We still
think CVX will win the bidding war for APC, perhaps at a slightly higher price tag given the competing
offer from Occidental Petroleum (OXY 61 ****), but that CVX has a bigger war chest and that
strategically, a CVX-APC combination makes a lot of sense. CVX's Permian asset is 75% liquids,
higher than the 65% mark we estimate for the Basin overall, which we think adds to CVX's
attractiveness given natural gas headwinds.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $115.50
Recommendation:
We keep our 12-month target price at $133, an 8.3x multiple of price to projected '20 operating
cash flow, a premium to CVX's historical forward average, but in line with that of chief rival Exxon
Mobil (XOM 69 ***). We keep our '19 EPS estimate flat at $6.42, but trim '20's by $0.23 to $6.93.
CVX posts Q3 EPS of $1.55 vs. $2.44, beating our estimate by $0.04. Overall Q3 production of 3.03
mmboe/d was fractionally below expectations, although production growth in the Permian Basin
remains strong. We estimate that CVX is generating more cash flow per barrel produced than is
XOM and its downstream unit profitability is stronger as well. We think CVX is doing a nice job on
free cash flow generation and think CVX has the capability to boost the dividend in '20 if desired (or
plow incrementally more into share buybacks). CVX's preliminary indication for '20 capex is a range
of $18B-$20B, which is flat to down vs. current run-rate, underscoring cost discipline.

the company's size and breadth of operations across the

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $86.27
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $84, cut $9, reflects a 7.6x multiple of projected '21 operating cash
flow, below CVX's historical forward average, but above that of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 41 ***).
We now see a per-share loss of $0.09 in '20 (prior EPS estimate of $0.61), and cut our '21 EPS
estimate by $0.42 to $2.62. CVX posts a Q2 loss per share of $1.59 excluding one-time items, vs.
EPS of $1.77, missing the consensus view by $0.67. CVX is battling weak fundamentals by slashing
capex, especially in the Permian Basin, where it now sees a quarterly run-rate in 2H '20 that is 75%
lower than the Q1 run-rate. As a result, Permian production is likely to slide by 6%-7% in '21. Overall
we view this as a somewhat underwhelming quarter for CVX, but we also note the relatively clean
balance sheet (net debt to capital of just 17% is better than peers), and we expect it to preserve the
dividend (yielding 6.0%).

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $117.90
Recommendation:
The Associated Press is reporting that buyout target Anadarko Petroleum (APC 73 ***) has
re-opened talks with second suitor Occidental Petroleum (OXY 60 ****), following CVX's prior
agreement with APC to merge. We note that CVX's bid of $65/share in cash and stock (25% cash)
was surpassed by OXY's offer of $76/share (50% cash), a difference of about $7 billion. If CVX's
initial agreement is ultimately spurned, APC will owe CVX a $1 billion breakup fee. We think APC is
simply angling for CVX to close the gap relative to OXY and we would not be surprised to see CVX
ultimately offer a slightly sweetened bid. We think APC's strategic overlap is stronger with CVX given
CVX's stakes in deepwater and international liquefied natural gas (LNG) and we think CVX has a
bigger war chest as well as a better balance sheet than does OXY. Our 12-month target price for
CVX remains $133 on relative metrics.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $85.30
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target of $88, up $2, reflects a 7x multiple of price to projected '21 operating cash
flow, below CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.96 to $3.73, and
start '22's at $5.36. A Q4 operating loss per share of $0.01, vs. EPS of $1.49, missed consensus by
$0.10. CVX anticipates production growth of up to 3% in '21 excluding possible asset sales, and net
debt to capital now stands at about 22% (above recent levels, but within a band of 20% to 25% that
CVX has outlined over the cycle). We think refining remains challenged (a function of still-weak
demand), but the addition of the former Noble Energy adds upstream growth potential from
Mediterranean natural gas. CVX is holding the line on capital spending, and its '21 budget of $14B is
up just 3.7% over '20. The dividend yields 5.8%, and while it eats about $9.8B per year, we think '21
operating cash flow can just about handle capex and the dividend, which shouldn't harm debt levels
materially.

Recent Price : $115.93
Recommendation:
We raise our 12-month target price by $5, to $133, reflecting an 8X multiple of price to projected
'19 operating cash flow, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We note that, since the
beginning of February, estimated operating cash flow in '19 has risen 15% even as the stock price is
essentially flat. We lift our '19 EPS estimate by $0.68 to $7.33, and '20's by $0.49 to $8.47. CVX
continues to build out its Permian franchise, along with deepwater prospects, and LNG. We still
think CVX will win the bidding war for APC, perhaps at a slightly higher price tag given the competing
offer from Occidental Petroleum (OXY 61 ****), but that CVX has a bigger war chest and that
strategically, a CVX-APC combination makes a lot of sense. CVX's Permian asset is 75% liquids,
higher than the 65% mark we estimate for the Basin overall, which we think adds to CVX's
attractiveness given natural gas headwinds.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORP.
Recent Price : $116.86
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price remains $133, 8.3x price to projected '20 operating cash flow, higher
than CVX's historical forward average, but slightly lower than that of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 69
***). We cut our '19 EPS estimate by $0.04 to $6.38, and '20's by $0.25 to $6.68. The WSJ reports
that CVX is taking an up to $11 billion impairment charge to reflect certain projects' inability to
compete effectively for capital under current economic conditions. Notably, this includes some of
CVX's natural gas assets in the Appalachias, as well as its LNG stake in Kitimat, BC, and reflects the
abundance of natural gas supply, which is weighing on pricing. Although this is a big impairment
charge, we note that CVX had shareholders' equity of $157 billion at the end of September, implying
that this charge accounts for up to 7% of equity. We see CVX as committed to cost discipline and
we still see strong free cash flow generation in '20, better even than XOM's.

Recent Price : $121.04
Recommendation:
CVX shares are up 3% pre-market as CVX eschews a higher bid for Anadarko Petroleum (APC 73
***), allowing rival bidder Occidental Petroleum (OXY 57 ****) to be the victor. CVX earns a
break-up fee of $1.0 billion from APC for its troubles, which CVX said will now be plowed into an
enhanced buyback program ($5.0 billion, versus prior of $4.0 billion). We think CVX is avoiding what
could have been a protracted bidding war for APC given OXY's backing by Warren Buffett, with the
side benefit of signaling to the market that CVX is highly cost-focused and not willing to win the bid
at any price. At current prices, we estimate that a $5.0 billion buyback program could reduce shares
outstanding by 2%. Our 12-month target price remains $133 based on relative metrics.

'24's at $15.45. Q4 EPS of $4.09, vs. $2.56, missed consensus by $0.20. CVX's '22 buyback of $15B
is probably a near-term peak, in our view, as operating cash flows will likely retract a bit in '23. To be
fair, CVX's balance sheet is pristine, with a net debt to capital ratio of 3.5%, much lower than CVX's
targeted range of 20% to 25%, so buyback largesse is still possible, depending on energy prices. The
company's capex guidance for '23 of $17B (which includes $3B targeted for its equity affiliates)
implies 25% growth vs. '22,at the high end of CVX's prior guidance range. Almost half of the '23
capex budget is targeted at U.S. upstream, and so we see U.S. shale (particularly the Permian) as a
key catalyst for near-term production that CVX guides to a 0%-3% growth range. Shares yield 3.2%.

Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price remains $98, an 11.3x multiple of forward cash flow, above CVX's
historical average. We narrow our projected loss per share in '20 by $0.62 to $0.22, and keep our '21
EPS estimate unchanged at $1.62. CVX posts Q1 EPS of $1.29, vs. $1.47, beating the consensus
view by $0.62. CVX is electing to trim its '20 capex budget by an additional $2.0 billion, to $14.0
billion, representing a 30% cut from its initial budget guidance of $20.0 billion. We see a significant
pullback in short-cycle project spending (such as in the Permian Basin), with the primary goal of
protecting the dividend and not straining the balance sheet too greatly. We note that CVX's end of
quarter debt-to-capital ratio edged up to 18% (with $5.4 billion in new borrowing), but still well
below that of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 43 **). We estimated CVX out-performed XOM on
upstream operating income per barrel in Q1, but headwinds on earnings power remain strong.

Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $168, up $5, reflects a 6.7x multiple of enterprise value to projected

CVX is seeing service cost inflation in the Permian, but this region comprises only about 20% of

next five years, CVX envisions spending in a range of $15B-$17B per year, with several deepwater
projects helping drive volume growth. CVX alluded to improved capital efficiency that can drive more
volume with relatively fewer capital dollars than in the past, but clearly, CVX is also focusing on
returns to shareholders, both from dividends and from buybacks.

Symbol: CVX
CFRA LIFTS VIEW ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORPORATION TO
BUY FROM HOLD
Recent Price : $164.26
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $193, raised $18, reflects a 6.0x multiple of enterprise value to
projected 2025 EBITDA, about in line with CVX's historical forward average. We raise our 2024 EPS
estimate by $0.09 to $12.84 and 2025's by $0.29 to $14.43. The U.S. Energy Information
Administration said recently that it expects increased shut-ins by U.S. dry gas producers (on the
heel of weak natural gas pricing) to result in lower natural gas production in Q2. In our view, this
could help put a floor under natural gas prices, and would be a benefit to CVX, which has greater
natural gas exposure than that of its chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 118 ****). We note that CVX has
underperformed XOM YTD by about 15 percentage points. While gas shut-ins would not solve all of
the headwinds facing natural gas lately (associated gas is another one), we think it would be a step
in the right direction. Shares also yield 3.9%.

Chevron Corporation – CVX
Independent Investment Research Focused on Public Company Interactions with the SEC.
Confirmed, Undisclosed SEC Investigation
Watch List Status: Maintained on Watch List of Companies with Undisclosed SEC Investigations
An undisclosed SEC investigation is again confirmed. The first Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) response indicating an SEC
investigation was dated 10-Jul-2018. On-going enforcement proceedings confirmed on appeal two times since, most recently
on 10-May-2019. For this reason, Chevron Corporation remains on our Watch List of companies with confirmed, undisclosed
SEC investigations.
Since we know there was at least one investigation in the recent past, we recommend those with an interest ask Chevron
Corporation what contact it has had with the SEC’s Division of Enforcement in the past two years. Keep in mind that a public
company can be involved in more than one SEC investigation at a time. As such, we routinely recommend asking a company
if there are any investigations beyond what is disclosed or reported in media stories – or even in our research.
Disclosure Insight®
In presence of an undisclosed SEC investigation, we view any of the following as potentially related –
1. Restatements or accounting problems. 9. Cancels or stops having analyst events.
2. Problems with disclosures. 10. Dodges questions or only accepts via email.
3. Departures / changes in key executive(s). 11. Controversy enough to draw attention.
4. Delayed or amended filings. 12. Negative news stories or analyst reports.
5. Missing earnings expectations. 13. Registrations taking too long or pulled.
6. High stock price volatility. 14. Larger-than-life CEO and/or senior executives.
7. Audit committee actions. 15. Company does things inconsistent with
8. Change of auditor. economic reality.
Clients are invited to contact us anytime, in total confidence, to discuss how to better assess the risks we identify here.
– John P. Gavin, CFA
From the Probes Reporter Database
If we alert you to the existence of an undisclosed SEC investigation – or any response from the SEC – that means we filed a
FOIA request on the company in question and have a response, in black-and-white on government letterhead, that supports
our statement.
We filed our first FOIA request on this company in May-2013. Below is the SEC response history for this company:
4-Jun-2013 FOIA Response No SEC investigative records found.
20-Feb-2015 FOIA Response SEC denies access to records over concern their release, ""could reasonably

Recent Price : $118.69
Recommendation:
We cut our 12-month target price by $3, to $133, reflecting an 8.4X multiple of price to projected
'20 operating cash flow, above CVX's historical forward average, but in line with that of chief rival
Exxon Mobil (XOM 69 ***). We lower our '19 EPS estimate by $0.88 to $6.42, and '20's by $1.53 to
$7.16. CVX reports Q3 results on Friday 11/1. Current consensus expectations suggest that CVX
should post Q3 earnings about 40% lower year over year, which we attribute to lackluster crude oil
and natural gas prices as well as narrower refining margins. Nonetheless, we remain bullish on CVX.
We expect refining margins to stage a turnaround shortly, and we estimate that CVX's free cash
flow profile has improved to the point that it now exceeds that of XOM, based on prospects in '20.
Shares yield 4.0%.

Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $162, cut $18, reflects a 5.7x multiple of enterprise value to projected
2024 EBITDA, modestly below CVX's historical forward average. We cut our 2023 EPS estimate by

earnings in the third quarter were about 12% weaker than those of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 105

Corporation (HES 145 ***) should enable some acceleration in international upstream production,
as its stake in blocks offshore Guyana (where XOM is the chief operator) should help in the
2024-2025 time frame. CVX also noted some cost creep arising in the TCO project in Kazakhstan,
which weighs on free cash flows to a degree. Still, CVX has low debt levels, and shares yield 4.1%.

Recent Price : $118.69
Recommendation:
We cut our 12-month target price by $3, to $133, reflecting an 8.4X multiple of price to projected
'20 operating cash flow, above CVX's historical forward average, but in line with that of chief rival
Exxon Mobil (XOM 69 ***). We lower our '19 EPS estimate by $0.88 to $6.42, and '20's by $1.53 to
$7.16. CVX reports Q3 results on Friday 11/1. Current consensus expectations suggest that CVX
should post Q3 earnings about 40% lower year over year, which we attribute to lackluster crude oil
and natural gas prices as well as narrower refining margins. Nonetheless, we remain bullish on CVX.
We expect refining margins to stage a turnaround shortly, and we estimate that CVX's free cash
flow profile has improved to the point that it now exceeds that of XOM, based on prospects in '20.

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Quick Take: Steadily tracking an undisclosed SEC investigation at Chevron since July 2018. Enforcement proceedings again
confirmed as ongoing, as of 01-Sep-2020. A FCPA problem? They are common in this sector. Maintained on Watch List.
An undisclosed SEC investigation is again confirmed. We filed our first FOIA request on this company in Jun-2012. The

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $111.40
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $128, cut by $5, reflects an 8x multiple of price-to-forward operating
cash flow, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We cut our '20 EPS estimate by $0.03 to
$7.32 and initiate our '21's EPS estimate at $7.33. Q4 EPS of $1.49 vs. $1.95, beat the consensus
view by $0.03. We estimate that CVX's upstream operating income per barrel fell sequentially 6% in
the U.S. and 12% in International, although both still fared better in both regions than those of chief
rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 62 ***). We see CVX continuing to build out its Permian acreage and its TCO
joint venture in Kazakhstan, but CVX's impairment charges to its U.S. natural gas assets highlights
weak visibility into the timing of a recovery. Still, CVX is keeping capex flat in '20, and with improving
free cash flows, we see room for additional buyback activity to complement dividends.

Recent Price : $153.83
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $172, a 6.2x multiple of EV to projected '24 EBITDA, in line with CVX's
historical forward average. CVX has agreed to buy PDC Energy Inc. (PDCE 71 ***) in a $7.6B deal
($6.3B in new CVX stock, plus $1.3B in assumed debt). We estimate the deal, if completed, boosts
CVX's share count by 4.6%, but should be immediately accretive. Strategically, we think the key to
the deal is PDCE's DJ Basin acreage, which is largely adjacent to CVX's and we think can enable CVX
to generate improved unit cost performance in that region. We see low regulatory risk with permits
in-hand through '28. On a stand-alone basis, we keep our '23 and '24 EPS estimates at $14.30 and
$14.63. PDCE would boost CVX's proved reserves by about 10%, with a longer reserve life, and we
think the deal price at under 3x '24 EBITDA is remarkably attractive. CVX shares are now down 14%
YTD, and CVX retains its ample balance sheet (cash hoard at more than $15B), which we believe will
be used in part for buybacks.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
Recent Price : $122.00
Recommendation:
Occidental Petroleum (OXY 59 ****) has made a rival bid for target Anadarko Petroleum (APC 71
***), offering $76/share in a 50% cash, 50% stock deal. This tops CVX's April 12 bid of $65/share,
which was 25% cash and 75% stock. We think from a strategic standpoint that CVX is a better
partner for APC than OXY would be, given what we view as better alignment between CVX and APC
on deepwater and LNG projects, along with Permian exposure. CVX would be owed a breakup fee of
$1.0 billion if APC rejects CVX in favor of OXY, although OXY's new bid is $7 billion higher (enterprise
value of $57B vs. $50B). We estimated that CVX's original bid was a 25% discount to APC's
historical forward multiple, and we think CVX arguably could be justified in paying a higher price
given the new offer, to at least get into closer range with that of OXY's bid. Our 12-month target
remains $128, based on relative metrics.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $122.06
Recommendation:
We lift our 12-month target price by $3, to $136, a 7.8X multiple of price to projected '20 operating
cash flow, about in line with that of rival ExxonMobil (XOM 74 ***). We cut our '19 EPS estimate by
$0.02 to $7.31, but raise '20's by $0.22 to $8.69. CVX reports Q2 results on Friday, and we see EPS
of $1.82, vs. $1.78. Although we expect higher production year over year, we think realized pricing is
likely weaker, and refining margins may be challenged by a weaker Brent-WTI spread and narrower
differentials between heavy and light crudes. The incremental $1.0 billion in cash received from the
failed bid to acquire Anadarko (APC 73 ***) will be largely redirected into buybacks, and we also
estimate that CVX currently has a lower dividend payout ratio than XOM's over the next 12 months,
which potentially opens the door for dividend hikes. Shares currently yield 3.9%.

LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Our 12-month target price of $170, up $2, reflects a 6.1x multiple of enterprise value to projected
'23 EBITDA, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '22 EPS estimate by $2.68 to
$18.88, and '23's by $3.13 to $17.17. Q2 EPS of $5.82, vs. $1.71, beat the consensus view by $0.79.
Q2 production of 2,896,000 boe/d was 1.6% below consensus, in part from expiration of contracts
in Indonesia and Thailand and the sale of Eagle Ford Shale assets. However, Permian Shale
production continues to advance, and CVX has cut its development costs in this play by 25% since
'19, which we view as remarkable given recent oil services cost inflation. Near-term, we see CVX
benefiting from Australian LNG, deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and the Permian. CVX boosted the upper
limit on its buyback authorization to $15 billion (from prior $10B), and, like chief rival Exxon Mobil
(XOM 96 ****), it is keeping its '22 capex guidance unchanged. Shares yield 3.8%.

the company's size and breadth of operations across the

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $178.38
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $188, up $6, reflects a 6.2x multiple of enterprise value to projected
'23 EBITDA, in line with CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '22 EPS estimate by $0.72 to
$19.08, but trim '23's by $0.29 to $17.61. Q3 EPS of $5.56 vs. $2.96 beat the consensus view by
$0.64. Q3 production of 3.027 mmboe/d was 2.2% above consensus and we estimate that
upstream unit profitability improved about 4% sequentially. CVX appears to be willing to open its
pocketbook for additional upstream supply, as Q3 cash capex was up 50% year-over-year, although
some of that increase would reflect resurgent oilfield services cost inflation. Production growth in
the Permian Basin year-to-date is ~15% and we think it remains in this range in Q4 and into '23,
mainly because of industry takeaway capacity constraints. We note that CVX's net debt to capital
ratio is around 5%, well below targeted levels, and we would not be surprised if management
pursued M&A deals.

Recent Price : $102.72
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price remains $109, a 6.8x multiple of projected '22 operating cash flow,
slightly below CVX's historical forward average, and reflective of concerns over the Delta variant.
CVX announced plans to form a distinct business unit to house its low-carbon investments, to be
named Chevron New Energies, and run by a 20-year veteran from the upstream side of CVX. The
new business organization will focus initially on commercialization of hydrogen, carbon capture
technologies, and biofuels, which we think is reasonable. To some degree, we think this is playing
catch-up on the low-carbon front relative to other supermajor oils, particularly the European
names, although we also think all of these supermajors are still in the early innings when it comes
to placating ESG-driven investors. CVX reports on 7/30, and we currently see '21 EPS of $6.34 (up
$1.48), and '22's at $7.07 (up $0.97).

CFRA LOWERS OPINION ON ENERGY TO MARKETWEIGHT FROM
OVERWEIGHT
Recent Price : $174.02
Recommendation:
We lower our recommended exposure to the S&P 500 Energy sector to marketweight from
overweight, as we think the group has reached its peak EPS growth for this cycle. Despite trading at
a steep discount to its 20-year average P/E on forward EPS growth expectations, S&P Capital IQ
consensus estimates call for a 16.1% decline in operating results in 2023 and an 8.8% slide in 2024.
However, we see this weakening earnings picture being offset by a still-tight supply outlook. Also,
CFRA's cap-weighted STARS for the group is now in line with the broader market. Finally, while the
sector's 40-week relative strength remains in the top 4, it continues to erode.

capital ratio of 21%. We expect further debt reductions to drive that ratio below 20%, but CVX also
announced the resumption of its share repurchase program, so we see both of those options
competing for incremental capital. CVX has cut its '21 capex by 7% to a revised $13B, some of
which is timing-related, but still maintains its long-term guidance of a range of $14B-$16B per
year through '25. CVX is trending towards shorter-cycle development (such as in the Permian),
which does enable more financial flexibility for buybacks, but may incur higher decline rates.

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON

Recent Price : $117.10
Recommendation:
The Board of Directors of Anadarko Petroleum (APC 76 ***) has declared the bid by rival Occidental
Petroleum (OXY 59 ****) to be superior to that of CVX's, setting the stage for CVX to potentially
respond -- within four days -- via an improved offer. We estimate that, at current prices, OXY's bid
exceeds that of CVX by about $7.3 billion, well above the $1.0 billion break-up fee that CVX would be
entitled to receive from APC if CVX's original bid is ultimately spurned. We also note that OXY's bid
contains a significantly higher cash component than CVX's bid. With or without APC, we think CVX
has excellent growth opportunities. We do not think CVX will chase the bid, particularly with Warren
Buffett seemingly in OXY's corner. We would not be surprised to see CVX move on to other potential
M&A targets, although, in our view, APC was really the only name out there with sizable Permian
assets that we also see as a motivated seller.

Recent Price : $91.04
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price remains $93, an 8.5X multiple of price to projected '21 operating cash
flow, above CVX's historical forward average. We think a slight premium is reasonable given CVX's
recent improvements in operational performance relative to chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 44 **).
CVX reports Q2 results on 7/31, and we forecast a net loss per share of $0.89, vs. EPS of $1.77 in
the year-earlier quarter. We lift our '20 EPS estimate by $0.35 to $0.61, and '21's by $0.92 to $3.04.
Aside from the typical interest in sources and uses of cash (and in particular, CVX's ability to sustain
its dividend), we will be interested to hear more on activity levels in the Permian Basin and Williston
Basin, as these are the primary U.S. operating regions for CVX's pending acquisition target Noble
Energy (NBL 11 ***). NBL also has strong exposure to Eastern Mediterranean natural gas, which will
likely add to CVX's considerable liquified natural gas (LNG) assets.

Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $109, raised $21, reflects an 8.5x multiple of price to projected '21

previously applied. We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.47 to $4.20, and '22's by $0.19 to $5.55. The
recent run-up in crude oil prices has buoyed the earnings forecasts of most of the upstream space,
and CVX is no exception. Although we think the rapid surge in pricing is not likely to persist, we also
think WTI should be able to average in the low to mid $50 per barrel range and, at this level, we think
CVX should be able to manage its capex plans as well as fund the dividend (yielding 4.7%) with more
margin for error. We are interested to see management's views on renewable energy as well as

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Recent Price : $158.16
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $180, a 6.6x multiple of EV to projected 2024 EBITDA, slightly above
CVX's historical forward average, which we see merited by our view that natural gas fundamentals
will improve in 2024. We cut our 2023 EPS estimate by $0.08 to $13.27, but raise 2024's by $0.20
to $14.60. Following the recent Q2 pre-earnings report (Q2 EPS of $3.08 vs. $5.82), today CVX
released full details on the second quarter. Production of 2.96 mmboe/d was 2.2% above the
year-ago quarter, and was 0.3% above consensus. Like its major rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 104 ***),
CVX is offering a 9% free cash flow yield today, but we see CVX with better near-term catalysts via
natural gas exposure. The spot price for the Henry Hub benchmark stands at $2.60/MMBtu, but we
think prices are likely to move higher, and we see CVX with stronger gas exposure than XOM. CVX
still has exposure to the Permian Basin, with Q2 production beating the prior record by 5%. Shares
yield 3.8% and we expect buyback spending to be high in 2H.

Recent Price : $165.93
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target of $171, cut $9, reflects a 6.2x multiple of enterprise value to projected 2024
EBITDA, in line with CVX's historical forward average. We cut our 2023 EPS estimate by $2.57 to
$14.23, and similarly 2024's by $0.59 to $14.86. CVX reports Q1 results on April 28 and we currently
project Q1 EPS of $3.48, which, if realized, would be a small improvement over Q1 2022 operating
EPS of $3.36. We anticipate that downstream operations will feature as CVX's best year-over-year
comparison in Q1, given that spot prices for the key U.S. crude oil benchmark West Texas
Intermediate (WTI) were down about 20% year-over-year. We expect WTI to be volatile in 2023 as
OPEC+ has shown a willingness to be agile with production cuts, and two rival demand-side factors
(the interest rate outlook, and the state of the China reopening trade) jockey for influence on that
front. We would not be surprised if CVX pursues acquisitions given its very low debt metrics and
high decline rates from shale oil plays.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $164.95
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $175, raised $15, reflects a 5.7x multiple of enterprise value to
projected 2025 EBITDA, slightly below CVX's historical forward average. We think a modest discount
is reasonable in light of CVX's higher exposure to natural gas than its chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM
119 ****), where we see continued price weakness in the near term. We lift our 2024 EPS estimate
by $0.20 to $12.75 and 2025's by $0.94 to $14.14. Q1 EPS of $2.93 vs. $3.55 beat the consensus
view by $0.02. Permian production of 859,000 boe/d (26% of total Q1 production) was better than
CVX had expected, helped by a lower decline rate, and the company now sees Permian production
exiting 2024 at about 900,000 boe/d. We note that the planned acquisition of Hess Corp. (HES 162
***) still needs a favorable resolution in arbitration given XOM's challenge over Guyana, and if that
decision is unfavorable to CVX, we think the rationale for the merger dissipates considerably.

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we positively view
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Recent Price : $68.80
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $73, cut $11, reflects a 6.5x multiple of price to projected '21
operating cash flow, below CVX's historical forward average, but above that of rival Exxon Mobil
(XOM 33 ***). We widen our expected per-share loss in '20 by $0.06 to $0.15, but raise our '21 EPS
estimate by $0.02 to $2.64. Q3 EPS of $0.11, vs. $1.55, beat the consensus view by $0.38. CVX
guided to '21 capex of roughly $14B (about $11B of which is going to upstream), well below its
initial long-term guidance provided in March, and Q3 opex was nearly 20% lower than pre-pandemic
levels in Q1. Near-term, we think CVX's Permian production likely drops in the mid single-digit
range, as much of the upstream capex goes towards longer-dated projects, given an over-supplied
market. CVX's dividend (now yielding 7.5%) requires an annual outlay of $9.6B, and we see a modest
shortfall for self-funding the dividend in '21, likely addressable with non-core asset sales or
perhaps further capex deferral.

segments of the energy sector. While we positively view
the company's size and breadth of operations across the

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Chevron Corporation
Symbol: CVX
CFRA CUTS VIEW ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORP. TO HOLD FROM
BUY
Recent Price : $157.20
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $163, raised $18, reflects a 7.5x multiple of enterprise value to
projected '23 EBITDA. The applied multiple is generous in our view, as it is well above the mean for
CVX on 'Year 2' EBITDA, based on CVX's historical forward multiples over the last 20 years, but below
peak levels. We lift our '22 EPS estimate by $1.03 to $11.52, and similarly '23's by $0.83 to $10.25.
CVX has little direct Russia exposure (a 15% stake in a Caspian pipeline which had 200,000 b/d of
Russian crude in 2021). However, CVX does have significant exposure to nearby Kazakhstan, where
CVX's 50% equity stake in Tengizchevroil (TCO) is located. We estimate that TCO comprised 17% of
CVX's consolidated net income in 2021. Shares are up 35% YTD, which we think reflects the rapid
surge in crude prices recently, but we think consensus estimates now capture much of that possible
upside. We also note that the WTI futures curve is in steep backwardation, suggesting only $90/b in
much of '23.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $168.14
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $172, raised $1, reflects a 6.2x multiple of enterprise value to
projected 2024 EBITDA, in line with CVX's historical forward average. We lift our 2023 EPS estimate
by $0.07 to $14.30, but trim 2024's by $0.23 to $14.63. Q1 EPS of $3.55 vs. $3.36 beat the
consensus view by $0.14. Production of 2.98 mmboe/d was down 1.2% versus consensus, and down
2.6% year-over-year. We think CVX's planned pivot in the Permian, shifting a bit more rig activity to
the New Mexico portion of the Delaware Basin, is to some degree a response to problems with well
spacing on the TX side of the Delaware. CVX reiterated its projection for overall Permian production,
noting a more 2H 2023-loaded growth profile. On a more positive note, net debt to capital remains
quite low (3% range), and we see ample coverage for the dividend, which yields 3.6%.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $163.55
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $180, up $8, reflects a 6.6x multiple of EV to 2024 EBITDA, slightly
above CVX's historical forward average, which we believe is reasonable given a natural gas price
outlook that we think should improve. We cut our 2023 EPS estimate by $0.95 to $13.35 and 2024's
by $0.23 to $14.40. CVX previewed Q2 results (full details arrive Friday), with Q2 operating EPS of
$3.08 vs. $5.82, beating consensus by $0.10. Q2 production of 2.96 mmboe/d rose 2.2% Y/Y and
production from the Permian Basin (0.77 mmboe/d) was a new record high. We chalk up the
significant Y/Y Q2 earnings degradation to the sharp pullback in energy prices. Nonetheless, on an
absolute level, crude oil prices remain high enough, in our view, to drive solid returns, and we note
that ROCE in Q2 was a respectable 13.4%. CVX remains committed to returns to shareholders, in
our view. The combination of dividends and buybacks in Q2 ($7.2B) dwarfed organic capital
spending ($3.8B), which is not unusual in the industry today.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $118.15
Recommendation:
We cut our 12-month target price by $7, to $130, reflecting an 8x multiple of price to projected '19
operating cash flow, above CVX's historical forward average, but still a small discount to chief rival
Exxon Mobil (XOM 76 ***). We cut our '19 EPS estimate by $2.51 to $7.08, and initiate '20's at
$7.77. CVX posts Q4 EPS of $1.95, vs. $0.72, $0.06 above consensus. CVX grew production by 7% in
'18, and sees growth of 4%-7% in '19. Notably, its capex plan for '19 is for flat spending vs. '18, and
for about 70% of its spend in '19 to turn into cash within 2 years. We see this as a relatively
short-cycle focus that likely incurs lower execution risk than the level of risk that CVX elected to
take on over the last few years (from Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG development projects). CVX is
buying a refinery in the U.S. Gulf Coast which we think pairs well with its other Gulf refining assets
and should enable more light oil processing, which could be an advantage with rising costs of heavy
crude.

CORPORATION
Recent Price : $87.19
Recommendation:
We narrow our 12-month target price to $93 from $98, reflecting an 11.1x multiple of forward
operating cash flow, a premium to CVX's historical average. We lift our 2020 EPS estimate to $0.26
from a $0.22 loss per share and our 2021 EPS estimate to $2.12 from $1.62. CVX announced it will
acquire Noble Energy for $5 billion in an all-stock deal, reflecting an approximate 8% premium for
the shares. We think the timing of this transaction was opportunistic, with Noble's shares trading
down approximately 60% year-to-date. We view the transaction favorably, as much of Noble's
Permian and DJ basin acreage is contiguous with CVX's, which should allow for longer laterals and
lower drilling costs. We also believe Noble's Eastern Mediterranean assets will provide a growth
opportunity for CVX.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $122.06
Recommendation:
We lift our 12-month target price by $3, to $136, a 7.8X multiple of price to projected '20 operating
cash flow, about in line with that of rival ExxonMobil (XOM 74 ***). We cut our '19 EPS estimate by
$0.02 to $7.31, but raise '20's by $0.22 to $8.69. CVX reports Q2 results on Friday, and we see EPS
of $1.82, vs. $1.78. Although we expect higher production year over year, we think realized pricing is
likely weaker, and refining margins may be challenged by a weaker Brent-WTI spread and narrower
differentials between heavy and light crudes. The incremental $1.0 billion in cash received from the
failed bid to acquire Anadarko (APC 73 ***) will be largely redirected into buybacks, and we also
estimate that CVX currently has a lower dividend payout ratio than XOM's over the next 12 months,
which potentially opens the door for dividend hikes. Shares currently yield 3.9%.

Recent Price : $110.37
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price remains $133, an 8.3x multiple of price to forward operating cash flow,
slightly above CVX's historical forward average. Ahead of CVX's Q4 results tomorrow, we update our
'19 EPS estimate to $6.31 (down $0.07), and '20's to $7.35 (up $0.67). CVX's ability to generate a
free cash flow surplus has improved in recent years, and in our view, should have a better '20 in that
regard than its chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 64 ***). Near-term catalysts include expansion in U.S.,
Lower 48 unconventional plays, notably the Permian Basin, downstream margins, and the status of
cost expectations on the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan (a project in which CVX has a 50% stake). We
note that CVX just announced that it will hike the quarterly dividend by 8%, to $1.29/share, effective
March 2020, implying a yield of 4.7%.

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
Recent Price : $121.04
Recommendation:
CVX shares are up 3% pre-market as CVX eschews a higher bid for Anadarko Petroleum (APC 73
***), allowing rival bidder Occidental Petroleum (OXY 57 ****) to be the victor. CVX earns a
break-up fee of $1.0 billion from APC for its troubles, which CVX said will now be plowed into an
enhanced buyback program ($5.0 billion, versus prior of $4.0 billion). We think CVX is avoiding what
could have been a protracted bidding war for APC given OXY's backing by Warren Buffett, with the
side benefit of signaling to the market that CVX is highly cost-focused and not willing to win the bid
at any price. At current prices, we estimate that a $5.0 billion buyback program could reduce shares
outstanding by 2%. Our 12-month target price remains $133 based on relative metrics.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $112.35
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $127, up $2, reflects a 7.5x multiple of projected '22 operating cash
flow, slightly above CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.65 to $7.92,
and '22's by $0.20 to $8.77. Q3 EPS of $2.96, vs. $0.11, beat the consensus estimate by $0.77. CVX
generated higher year over year production on lower capex, and cash from operations in Q3 dwarfed
the Q3 '20 comparison, which we think highlights an excellent quarter. On a unit profitability basis,
we think CVX also delivered better performance in the upstream than its chief rival Exxon Mobil
(XOM 65 ****). CVX signaled that it may accelerate buybacks, given that its net debt to capital
metrics have fallen below target levels. The dividend, at an annualized $5.36 per share, yields about
4.7%, adding to total return potential. We also see the dividend as secure, given a payout ratio of
just 61% in '22 based on our estimates.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $162.19
Recommendation:
CVX is buying upstream peer Hess Corporation (HES 163 ***) in an all-stock deal valued at about
$58 billion. Per the deal, each share of HES will be exchanged for 1.025 shares of CVX stock. We
estimate the deal at an enterprise value to 2024 EBITDA multiple of 8.1x, in line with HES's five-year
historical forward average, and only 1% above HES's current multiple. The deal is expected to close
in early 2024, and CVX views it as accretive by 2025. We like the deal for CVX both from a strategic
and valuation standpoint. Strategically, CVX adds more oil exposure in long-cycle plays (Guyana),
which complements CVX's expansion in the short-cycle Permian Basin. On valuation, we are
surprised at the minimal premium needed, and the lack of a cash component implies to us that CVX
still has a tremendous amount of dry powder for both share buybacks and dividend hikes. Our
12-month target price remains $180 on a 6.2x EV/EBITDA multiple, in line with CVX's historical
forward average; shares yield 3.6%.

CORPORATION
Recent Price : $117.90
Recommendation:
The Associated Press is reporting that buyout target Anadarko Petroleum (APC 73 ***) has
re-opened talks with second suitor Occidental Petroleum (OXY 60 ****), following CVX's prior
agreement with APC to merge. We note that CVX's bid of $65/share in cash and stock (25% cash)
was surpassed by OXY's offer of $76/share (50% cash), a difference of about $7 billion. If CVX's
initial agreement is ultimately spurned, APC will owe CVX a $1 billion breakup fee. We think APC is
simply angling for CVX to close the gap relative to OXY and we would not be surprised to see CVX
ultimately offer a slightly sweetened bid. We think APC's strategic overlap is stronger with CVX given
CVX's stakes in deepwater and international liquefied natural gas (LNG) and we think CVX has a
bigger war chest as well as a better balance sheet than does OXY. Our 12-month target price for
CVX remains $133 on relative metrics.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $91.90
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target of $86, up $13, reflects a 7.5x multiple of price to projected '21 operating
cash flow, about in line with CVX's historical forward average. We narrow our projected loss per
share in '20 by $0.02 to $0.13, and raise our '21 EPS estimate by $0.13 to $2.77. CVX reiterated its
intended capex budget of $14B for '21, but, notably, cut its longer-term budget range in 2022-2025
to a revised $14B-$16B, down about 27% from prior plans using the midpoint of the range. We
think the change in budget for coming years highlights greater emphasis on shorter-cycle projects,
such as the Permian Basin. We think CVX's dividend (yielding 5.7%) will chew up about $10B in '21,
and free cash flow likely covers most of it, although asset sales may be needed to assist. Thus, while
we think protection of the dividend is a goal in order to retain income investors, we also believe that
if another major pullback in pricing occurs (dragging cash flows down with it), a dividend cut is
possible.

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

CORPORATION
Recent Price : $118.15
Recommendation:
We cut our 12-month target price by $7, to $130, reflecting an 8x multiple of price to projected '19
operating cash flow, above CVX's historical forward average, but still a small discount to chief rival
Exxon Mobil (XOM 76 ***). We cut our '19 EPS estimate by $2.51 to $7.08, and initiate '20's at
$7.77. CVX posts Q4 EPS of $1.95, vs. $0.72, $0.06 above consensus. CVX grew production by 7% in
'18, and sees growth of 4%-7% in '19. Notably, its capex plan for '19 is for flat spending vs. '18, and
for about 70% of its spend in '19 to turn into cash within 2 years. We see this as a relatively
short-cycle focus that likely incurs lower execution risk than the level of risk that CVX elected to
take on over the last few years (from Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG development projects). CVX is
buying a refinery in the U.S. Gulf Coast which we think pairs well with its other Gulf refining assets
and should enable more light oil processing, which could be an advantage with rising costs of heavy
crude.

Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $120.50
Recommendation:
CVX has agreed to acquire Anadarko Petroleum (APC 61 ***) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at
$50 billion including assumption of APC debt. Per the deal, CVX is getting APC for 0.39 shares of CVX
stock plus $16.25 in cash, for each share of APC, and is expected to close in 2H '19. We estimate
the deal values APC at 6.6x forward EBITDA, which, while a sizable premium to APC's current
valuation, is still 25% below APC's historical forward EBITDA multiple. As a result, we see CVX
capitalizing on APC's significant valuation weakness of late. APC should boost CVX in U.S. shale
(including the all-important Permian Basin), as well as deepwater development and LNG, which
mesh well with CVX's existing growth projects. Thus, we like the deal strategically, and financially it
seems like a good deal for CVX (despite the 30% premium) given APC's historical valuation. We keep
our 12-month target price on CVX at $128, based on stand-alone forward valuation multiples.

LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
Recent Price : $122.00
Recommendation:
Occidental Petroleum (OXY 59 ****) has made a rival bid for target Anadarko Petroleum (APC 71
***), offering $76/share in a 50% cash, 50% stock deal. This tops CVX's April 12 bid of $65/share,
which was 25% cash and 75% stock. We think from a strategic standpoint that CVX is a better
partner for APC than OXY would be, given what we view as better alignment between CVX and APC
on deepwater and LNG projects, along with Permian exposure. CVX would be owed a breakup fee of
$1.0 billion if APC rejects CVX in favor of OXY, although OXY's new bid is $7 billion higher (enterprise
value of $57B vs. $50B). We estimated that CVX's original bid was a 25% discount to APC's
historical forward multiple, and we think CVX arguably could be justified in paying a higher price
given the new offer, to at least get into closer range with that of OXY's bid. Our 12-month target
remains $128, based on relative metrics.

Chevron Corporation
Symbol: CVX
CFRA CUTS VIEW ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORP. TO HOLD FROM
BUY
Recent Price : $94.62
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $98, a 10.8x multiple of enterprise value to forward EBITDA, a
discount to rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 47 ***). We see an operating loss of $0.84 in '20 (prior EPS
estimate of $7.32) and cut our '21 EPS estimate by $5.71 to $1.62. CVX reports Q1 earnings
tomorrow, and our estimate of $0.67 (vs. Q1 '19's $1.47 result) is likely the last one in '20 with
positive earnings, barring a V-shaped recovery in oil. Shares of CVX are up 35% in the last month,
and although still down 23% YTD, we no longer think forward multiples remain attractive. European
rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A 44 ***) just slashed its dividend by 66%, its first cut since World War
II, which perhaps creates more agita for CVX shareholders that CVX will follow suit. We note,
however, that XOM has reaffirmed its diivdend for Q1, and we think RDS.A had higher debt ratios and
weaker free cash flow than CVX. Thus, we still expect CVX to maintain its dividend (5.5% yield).

segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON
CORPORATION
Recent Price : $95.32
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $98, cut $30, reflects a 7X multiple of forward operating cash flow,
below CVX's historical forward average. The emergence of the unexpected crude oil market share
war launched by Saudi Arabia has crushed oil prices today, with benchmark WTI oil down 23% to
$32/b today, and we would not be surprised if the recent historical low of $26/b (from Feb. '16) was
breached in the near future. Nonetheless, given CVX's balance sheet and opex improvements in
recent years, we still estimate that CVX will be able to cover anticipated '20 capex needs as well as
its dividend obligations via operating cash flow, which we view as enviable. CVX has a net debt to
capital ratio of just 10%, and although it has $5.0 billion in debt maturing in '20, it also has $5.7
billion in cash on the balance sheet. Finally, we estimate CVX with an interest coverage ratio of 13x,
above the average for supemajor oils. Shares yield 5.4%.

CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORP.
Recent Price : $130.95
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target price of $145, raised $18, reflects a 7.8x multiple of projected '22 operating
cash flow, about in line with CVX's historical forward average. We lift our '22 EPS estimate by $1.72
to $10.49, and start '23's at $9.42. Q4 EPS of $2.56, vs. a loss per share of $0.01, missed the
consensus view by $0.56. CVX guided to '22 production dropping between 0% - 3%, adversely
affected by contract expirations in Asia; excluding these contracts as well as asset sales, pro-forma
production should rise 2%-5%. We see the Permian Basin being the single largest catalyst in the
upstream, where production should be up in the neighborhood of 10% in '22 and where we think the
largest incremental increase in capex will occur. CVX boosted its dividend by 6% to an annualized
$5.68 per share, or a yield of 4.4%. On an unaudited basis, CVX said it achieved a reserve
replacement rate of 112% in '21, which we view as solid.

LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we positively view
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Recommendation:
The United Auto Workers (UAW) labor union has elected to conduct a ""stand-up strike,"" under which
it is striking at three specific auto plants in the Midwest, one apiece for each of the Big 3 U.S.
automakers. The UAW had recently rejected proposed pay increases in the 17.5%-20.0% range.
While we do not know how long this strike may persist (nor whether it may spread to other plants),
we do presume that at some point, it will settle with a higher cost base for the Big 3. As a result, to
the degree that such costs are passed on to consumers, we think it may slow the onset of new car
sales, since new cars should be pricier (including new electric vehicles produced by the Big 3). All
else being equal, we think this means a slower transition toward EVs in the U.S., thereby buttressing
near-term demand for refined oil products, such as gasoline and diesel. The major integrated oils
have clean balance sheets, healthy dividends, and are currently benefiting from strong refining
utilization.

the company's size and breadth of operations across the

CORPORATION
Recent Price : $115.50
Recommendation:
We keep our 12-month target price at $133, an 8.3x multiple of price to projected '20 operating
cash flow, a premium to CVX's historical forward average, but in line with that of chief rival Exxon
Mobil (XOM 69 ***). We keep our '19 EPS estimate flat at $6.42, but trim '20's by $0.23 to $6.93.
CVX posts Q3 EPS of $1.55 vs. $2.44, beating our estimate by $0.04. Overall Q3 production of 3.03
mmboe/d was fractionally below expectations, although production growth in the Permian Basin
remains strong. We estimate that CVX is generating more cash flow per barrel produced than is
XOM and its downstream unit profitability is stronger as well. We think CVX is doing a nice job on
free cash flow generation and think CVX has the capability to boost the dividend in '20 if desired (or
plow incrementally more into share buybacks). CVX's preliminary indication for '20 capex is a range
of $18B-$20B, which is flat to down vs. current run-rate, underscoring cost discipline.

Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $109, an 8.3x multiple of price to projected '21 operating cash flow,
about in line with that of chief rival Exxon Mobil (XOM 58 ***). We lift our '21 EPS estimate by $0.66

note that free cash flow in Q1 was sufficient to cover both cash capex needs as well as the dividend,
which points to (1) the improvement in crude oil prices, plus (2) sizable reductions in cash capex.
The tradeoff, in our view, is that lower capex runs the risk of hurting production levels, likely in the

Price Performance Analyst's Risk Assessment
LOW MEDIUM HIGH
Our risk assessment reflects our view of Chevron's
exposure to volatile, cyclical, and capital-intensive
segments of the energy sector. While we view positively
the company's size and breadth of operations across the
energy value chain, we also note that upstream operations
are exposed to volatile energy prices.

Chevron Corporation
Symbol: CVX
CFRA KEEPS HOLD OPINION ON SHARES OF CHEVRON CORP.
Recent Price : $186.41
Recommendation:
Our 12-month target remains $188 on forward EV/EBITDA analysis. CVX reports Q4 earnings on
1/27, and we currently estimate EPS of $4.34, $0.05 above consensus. Ahead of that release, CVX
announced a rather large increase to its buyback program, effective April '23. The new program, of
up to $75B, is 3x the size of the prior four-year program that expires at the end of March 2023.
Technically, at current prices, the authorization would allow CVX to repurchase almost 22% of
shares outstanding. However, there is no expiry date on the new $75B program, so whether it
actually amounts to an acceleration in buybacks is unclear. We note that in Q3, CVX repurchased
$3.7B in stock, and if CVX simply maintained that pace, we estimate the new authorization would be
exhausted by '28. Coupled with CVX's choice to boost its quarterly dividend by 6% to $1.51 per
share (annualized, a yield of 3.2%), we see CVX committed to a conservative spending path, which
we view as fiscally sensible.
