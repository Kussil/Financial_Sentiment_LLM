Spark!Lab is an experiential learning and activity space \\u2013 developed by the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center \\u2013 that provides children and young people with opportunities to invent, design, collaborate, and find solutions to real-world problems, equipping them with STEM skills that can ultimately help them build careers in creative industries. Together with ConocoPhillips Qatar, QF and the Lemelson Center created a pop-up Spark!Lab at Education City during the FIFA Arab Cup 2021\\u2122, where young participants worked together on innovations themed around accessibility and sport. Spark!Lab will be back at QF at the end of the year, before and during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022\\u2122, after which the partnership seeks to build a permanent Spark!Lab within Education City Stadium post-tournament. The partnership will also make invention education learning materials globally available in the Arabic language. \\u201cWelcoming Spark!Lab to Education City, which has been made possible through our long-term strategic partnership with the Smithsonian Institution and ConocoPhillips Qatar\\u2019s support, reflects QF\\u2019s commitment to providing our youth with new and engaging opportunities to explore, discover, grow, and become lifelong learners,\\u201d said Machaille Hassan Al-Naimi, President of Community Development, Qatar Foundation. \\u201cWe believe in both the importance of accessibility and inclusivity, and the power of sport, in building strong, healthy, vibrant communities, and it has been wonderful to see children and young people produce amazing, inventive solutions to real-life challenges based on these themes at the pop-up Spark!Lab. \\u201cTo see them embracing the invention education opportunities that Spark!Lab offers makes us really excited for its return in 2022, the opportunities that it will offer youth in Qatar beyond the World Cup, and the invention education resources in the Arabic language that will be made possible through this partnership. We look forward to seeing our work with the Smithsonian Institution continuing to go from strength to strength, as together we open up new pathways for youth to realize their potential.\\u201d Arthur Daemmrich, Director of the Smithsonian\\u2019s Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, said: \\u201cIt has been inspiring to see young people in Qatar embrace inventive identities. \\u201cTheir willingness to tackle challenges that use both familiar and novel materials and to create physical prototypes while practicing 21st Century skills of risk-taking, perseverance, and creative problem solving bodes well for the future of Qatar and the world. \\u201cWe have been fortunate to have such engaged collaborators in Qatar Foundation and ConocoPhillips Qatar, which has made it possible to carry out our most successful international Spark!Lab to date. Continuing to develop new activities that relate to innovations in Qatar while benefitting the world is an exciting next step for us.\\u201d \\u201cOur future relies on the next generation of inventors, as our communities and industries will need their ideas to solve challenges and power our economies. Spark!Lab plays an invaluable role inspiring children to become leaders in STEM fields, encouraging them to foster lifelong passions for science and engineering,\\u201d said Todd Creeger, President of ConocoPhillips Qatar. \\u201cWe are proud to partner with the Smithsonian Institution and Qatar Foundation, two leading entities in the fields of education and scientific research, to bring this unique initiative to Qatar. This offers a glimpse of the potential for multi-disciplinary collaborations between industry and public organizations to bring a positive impact to society.\\u201d QF\\u2019s collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution \\u2013 the US\\u2019 leading education, cultural, and research institution \\u2013 was formed in 2020 at the third U.S.-Qatar Strategic Dialogue in Washington D.C., and focuses on education, science, and conservation and heritage preservation.

The stock is a Shell Centre, 2 York Road, London, Greater London, SE1\\nconstituent of FTSE 100 Index. As of February 12, 2021, The Capital Group is effectively the largest 7NA\\nshareholder with a 5% stake in the firm.\\nTelephone\\nDIVISIONAL OVERVIEW: Shell has five reporting segments \\u2013 Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products,\\n44 80 0731 8888\\nChemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas (45% of 2021 normalized earnings) business focuses on liquefying\\nnatural gas (LNG) for transportation to customers around the world.

At the same time, it will continue divesting non-strategic assets at an annual average of around\\nUnited Kingdom Ernst & Young LLP\\nUSD4 billion to high-grade its portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders will still be rewarded by progressive\\ndividend growth of around 4% each year, as well as additional cash return via share buybacks that will bring Founded\\ntotal shareholders distributions to around 20-30% of cash flow from operations. 1907\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: Shell\\u2019s financial performance recovered in 2021 with adjusted earnings nearly\\nEmployees\\nquadrupled Y/Y to USD19.3 billion, leading to a sharp rebound in return on average capital employed to 8.5%\\n82,000\\nfrom 2.9% in prior year.

In late 1999, the Federal Trade Commission allowed Exxon and Mobil to reunite, Investor contact\\ncreating Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest publicly-traded integrated oil company in the world aside from Saudi J. K. Driscoll (972-940-6000)\\nAramco (the national oil company of Saudi Arabia). ExxonMobil\\u2019s businesses include Upstream (an after-tax\\nnet profit of $15.8 billion in 2021, versus a $20.0 billion after-tax net loss in 2020); Downstream ($2.1 Office\\nbillion, -$1.1 billion); and Chemicals ($7.8 billion, $2.0 billion). Factoring in corporate and financing 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas, 75039-2298\\nexpenses, overall net profit after tax in 2021 was $23.0 billion, essentially mirroring 2020\\u2019s net loss after tax\\nof $22.4 billion. The biggest factors in our view in the remarkable one-year turnaround in profitability were Telephone\\n(1) demand recovering from the depths of the pandemic, coupled with (2) ongoing conservative spending 972-940-6000\\nlevels on new supply across the industry. Proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2021 stood at 18.5 billion\\nFax\\nBOE (58% liquids; 67% developed). Oil and gas production in 2021 fell 1.3%, to 3.71 million barrels of oil\\nN/A\\nequivalent per day.\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY. At its most recent annual Investor Day event (March 2022), XOM expected Website\\nproduction, ex-divestitures, to be about 3.8 million boe/d in 2022, rising to 4.2 mmboe/d by 2027 - an corporate.exxonmobil.com\\nimplied CAGR of 2.0%. XOM also guided to capital spending through 2027 will, on average, be about 50%\\nhigher than in 2021 - and yet still below 2019 levels. The major capital projects remain centered around Officers\\nBrazil and offshore Africa, complemented by the Permian Basin and the Golden Pass LNG development in Chairman of the Board, VP, Secretary & General\\nthe U.S. Gulf Coast.

A. Kandarian\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. XOM has funded $3 billion into its new Low Carbon Solutions business, J. L. Hooley S. K. Avery\\nwhich serves as the focal point for XOM\\u2019s efforts related to the energy transition towards renewables. We J. W. Ubben U. M. Burns\\nnote that XOM\\u2019s carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) ventures are part of this group. We believe that\\nXOM will focus on renewables that are \\u201cfossil fuel adjacent\\u201d, such that the technology involved is fairly close\\nto their core competencies. Domicile Auditor\\nNew Jersey PricewaterhouseCoopers\\nIn January 2017, XOM reached an agreement to purchase 275,000 acres of land in the Permian Basin from\\nLLP\\nthe Bass family of Fort Worth, TX, in exchange for $5.6 billion in XOM stock and possible contingency Founded\\npayments of up to $1 billion in cash, based on performance. The deal doubles XOM\\u2019s prior asset base in the 1870\\nPermian, which we view as the most economically viable region for U.S. unconventional shale oil\\ndevelopment. Employees\\n63,000\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including $10\\nbillion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of $11.51\\nStockholders\\nper proved BOE. However, in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2 billion impairment charge on some of\\n325,508\\nits dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s production is\\napproximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to some degree,\\nreduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges became more\\nsevere in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets in the U.S., as\\nwell as assets in Canada and Argentina. The unexpected war between Russia and Ukraine in early 2021 has\\nled to greater interest by continental Europe in buying U.S. LNG, which we think has contributed to rising\\nnatural gas prices.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2021, XOM had long-term debt of $41.7 billion (down $2.8 billion\\nfrom year-end 2020) and cash balances of $6.8 billion (up $2.4 billion). In March 2021, XOM said that $45/b\\ncrude oil could cover both its capex needs as well as its dividend, and EIA projections call for WTI crude oil\\naveraging more than $85/b in both 2022 and 2023.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion shares after the\\nExxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of December 31, 2021, XOM\\nhad a diluted share count of 4.23 billion shares, down 1.2% versus the end of 2019.

Employees\\n63,000\\nOn June 25, 2010, XOM purchased XTO Energy, Inc. in an all-stock deal valued at $40.5 billion (including $10\\nbillion of long-term debt). The deal added 2,471 million BOE (84% natural gas) at an implied value of $11.51\\nStockholders\\nper proved BOE. However, in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2 billion impairment charge on some of\\n325,508\\nits dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s production is\\napproximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to some degree,\\nreduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges became more\\nsevere in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets in the U.S., as\\nwell as assets in Canada and Argentina. The unexpected war between Russia and Ukraine in early 2021 has\\nled to greater interest by continental Europe in buying U.S. LNG, which we think has contributed to rising\\nnatural gas prices.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2021, XOM had long-term debt of $41.7 billion (down $2.8 billion\\nfrom year-end 2020) and cash balances of $6.8 billion (up $2.4 billion). In March 2021, XOM said that $45/b\\ncrude oil could cover both its capex needs as well as its dividend, and EIA projections call for WTI crude oil\\naveraging more than $85/b in both 2022 and 2023.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion shares after the\\nExxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of December 31, 2021, XOM\\nhad a diluted share count of 4.23 billion shares, down 1.2% versus the end of 2019. As of late April 2022,\\nshares yield 4.0%.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.

However, in the fourth quarter of 2016, XOM took a $2 billion impairment charge on some of\\n325,508\\nits dry gas assets, based on revised long-term assumptions for natural gas prices. XTO\\u2019s production is\\napproximately 38% liquids and 62% natural gas, and so the impairment charge reflects, to some degree,\\nreduced long-term expectations for the natural gas resources in place. Impairment charges became more\\nsevere in late 2020 when XOM took another $19.3 billion charge on some of its dry gas assets in the U.S., as\\nwell as assets in Canada and Argentina. The unexpected war between Russia and Ukraine in early 2021 has\\nled to greater interest by continental Europe in buying U.S. LNG, which we think has contributed to rising\\nnatural gas prices.\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. As of December 31, 2021, XOM had long-term debt of $41.7 billion (down $2.8 billion\\nfrom year-end 2020) and cash balances of $6.8 billion (up $2.4 billion). In March 2021, XOM said that $45/b\\ncrude oil could cover both its capex needs as well as its dividend, and EIA projections call for WTI crude oil\\naveraging more than $85/b in both 2022 and 2023.\\nXOM reduced its share count to 4.16 billion shares at the end of 2015, down from 7 billion shares after the\\nExxon/Mobil merger in 1999 and 5.1 billion after the XTO acquisition in 2010. As of December 31, 2021, XOM\\nhad a diluted share count of 4.23 billion shares, down 1.2% versus the end of 2019. As of late April 2022,\\nshares yield 4.0%.\\nRedistribution or reproduction is prohibited without prior written permission.
