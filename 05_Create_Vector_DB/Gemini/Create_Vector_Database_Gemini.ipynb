We like BP for its\\nfocus on delivering its Integrated Energy\\nCompany strategy via i) high-grading\\nhydrocarbon business, ii) growing convenience\\nand mobility business, and iii} building discipline\\nin low carbon energy business. The group set a\\ncapex target of ~USD16 billion for 2023 and\\nUSD14-USD18 annually in 2024-2030. The\\ncapex will focus on shorter cycle and fast-\\npayback oil & gas projects and transition growth\\nengines, which we think reflect a constructive\\nview of the long-term energy prospect. Also, we\\ntake comfort in BP\\u2019s reaffirmation of its\\ncommitment to grow its dividend by 4% and\\ndeliver ~USD4 billion per annum of share\\nbuybacks through 2025 with Brent oil price at\\nUSD60/bbI. However, we are mildly disheartened\\nby its near-term elevated level of refinery\\nturnarounds and price lags on Mexico and UAE\\nhydrocarbons, which made it a laggard amid the\\ncurrent oil price upcycle.\\n\\n> Key downside risks include weaker hydrocarbon\\nprices, tighter downstream margins, and\\nexecution issues.\\n\\n> Our 12-month target price for BP of USD36\\nreflects a P/NAV of 1.7x, a premium to the\\nEuropean oil majors\\u2019 average of 1.2x, justified in\\nour view by BP\\u2019s superior reserve life.\\n\\nAnalyst's Risk Assessment\\n\\nLOW MEDIUM HIGH\\n\\nOur risk assessment balances the concern over BP\\u2019s\\nconsiderably high exposure in Russia against BP\\u2019s\\noperations across the entire energy value chain, robust\\ncash flows, balance sheet, and prospects from\\ntransitionary growth.\\n\\nRevenue/Earnings Data\\n\\nRevenue (Million USD)\\n\\n1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year\\n2024 -- -- -- -- E 197,000\\n2023 55,708 48,134 52,813 -- E 202,000\\n2022 48,753 67,242 54,372 69,373 241,392\\n2021 34,544 36,172 35,820 50,503 156,786\\n2020 59,447 31,552 26,172 44,789 180,366\\n2019 65,897 72,305 67,951 70,697 276,850\\nEarnings Per ADS (USD)\\n\\n1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q Year\\n2024 -- -- -- -- \\u00a35.58\\n2023 1.66 0.89 1.15 -- E540\\n2022 1.92 2.61 2.59 1.59 8.74\\n2021 1.37 0.83 0.99 1.23 3.82\\n2020 -130 -498 -0.13 0.40 -6.03\\n2019 0.70 0.83 0.66 0.76 2.95\\n\\nFiscal Year ended Dec 31.

The company is headquartered in London with operations across 62 countries, spanning the\\nentire oil and gas value chain. BP is listed on the London and Frankfurt Stock Exchanges, and it maintains an\\nADR program on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is one of the key constituents of the FTSE 100\\nIndex. As of end-2022, the major holders of BP\\u2019s common shares consist primarily of institutional investors\\nsuch as BlackRock (10.8%) and Vanguard (4.4%).\\n\\nDIVISIONAL OVERVIEW: Owing to the sanction against Russia, BP has ceased to report Rosneft (in which BP\\nowns a 19.75% stake but fully impaired to zero carrying value owing to counter-sanctions from Russia\\nwhich restricts the divestment of Russian assets by foreign investors] as a separate segment thus leaving\\nBP with four main business segments - Gas & Low Carbon Energy, Oil Production & Operations, Customers\\n& Products, and others.\\n\\nThe Gas & Low Carbon Energy segment (35% of 2022 underlying EBIT] encompasses geographic regions\\nwhich predominantly produce natural gas. It also includes activities in the marketing and trading of natural\\ngas and LNG, along with power and natural gas liquids. Furthermore, BP\\u2019s renewables businesses, including\\nbiofuels, solar, and wind are grouped under the segment. The Oil Production & Operations segment (44%],\\nmeanwhile, comprises regions where the firm is involved in the exploration, development, and production of\\npredominantly oil resources.\\n\\nThe Customers & Products segment (23%) primarily consists of its downstream and customer-focused\\nbusinesses. These include refining, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and also the supply and\\ntrading of fuels, lubricants, and petrochemical products to wholesale and retail customers in more than 100\\ncountries. Next-generation offerings such as electrification are also grouped under the segment. It operates\\nprimarily in Europe and North America and manufactures and markets products across Australasia, China,\\nand other parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.\\n\\nOthers which comprise innovation & engineering, bp ventures, Launchpad, regions, corporates & solutions,\\nand corporate activities & functions registered an underlying net loss of USD1 billion.\\n\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY: BP aims to pivot its business towards becoming an integrated energy company with\\na focus on delivering solutions for customers. To do so, the firm will pursue growth in three focus areas [i]\\n\\nlow carbon electricity and energy (EBITDA target of $2-3 billion by 2030): building scale in renewables and\\n\\nbioenergy, seeking early positions in hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage, and building out\\na customer gas portfolio to complement these low carbon energies; (ii) convenience and mobility [EBITDA\\ntarget of $9-11 billion by 2030) - redefining the experience of convenience retail, EV charging and scaling\\nBP\\u2019s presence and fuel sales in growth markets; and (iii) resilient and focused hydrocarbons (target to\\nsustain EBITDA at $39-42 billion through 2030): high-grading the hydrocarbon portfolio, resulting in\\n\\nsignificantly lower and more competitive production and refining throughput alongside bioenergy. By 2030,\\nproduction is anticipated to decline by 25% relative to 2019.\\n\\nFor its financial framework, BP allocated $16 billion for capex in 2023 (including inorganic capex} and\\nintends to keep its annual capex in a range of $14-18 billion through 2030, while targeting over $25 billion\\nof divestments. Financial discipline will remain its focus, as it aims to maintain organic cash flow break-even\\nat Brent oil price of around $40/bbl, RMM of USD11/bbl, and Henry Hub of $3/mmBtu. Overall, the strategic\\nplan should lead to a return on average capital employed (ROACE) of around >18% by 2025, with EBITDA per\\nshare growing at a CAGR of >12% throughout the period. Shareholders, meanwhile, will be rewarded with a\\n4% annual increase in DPS and share buybacks, where BP expects to be around $4 billion per annum\\nthrough 2025 with Brent oil price at $60/bbI.\\n\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: After being hit by the industry downturn during 2020, BP\\u2019s underlying profits\\n{replacement cost basis) recovered to $12.8 billion in 2021 and further soared to $27.7 billion in 2022,\\nunderpinned by exceptionally high oil & gas price realization and stronger refining margins. This is\\naccompanied by a strong improvement in operating cash flow which jumped to $40.9 billion in 2022 from\\n$23.6 billion. Coupled with proceeds from asset divestments, BP\\u2019s balance sheet strength has improved with\\nnet gearing reduced to 20% in 2022 from 25% in 2021, enabling the group to raise its cash returns to\\nshareholders.\\n\\nCorporate information\\n\\nInvestor contact\\n\\nC.

By definition, integrated oils operate at\\nboth ends of the oil and gas value chain (upstream\\nas well as downstream], although typically\\nupstream is the primary driver for operating\\nprofits.\\n\\nOn the supply side, disciplined cuts from key\\nproducing nations should be able to blunt demand\\nweakness that may occur in 2024. For U.S. West\\nTexas Intermediate (WTI) crude, we think an\\noverall average in the $90 per barrel {/b) range for\\n2024 as a whole (versus just $78/b in the first 10\\nmonths of 2023) is eminently viable. U.S.\\nproducers continue to show a preference for free\\ncash flow growth over production growth, although\\nwe do expect the U.S. to eke out a small increase\\nin domestic production. One wildcard on the\\nsupply side to watch is OPEC+ discipline. To be fair,\\nthe consortium has wielded strong discipline in\\nrecent years. However, the early December 2023\\nmeeting in Vienna ended with no collective\\nagreement on voluntary cuts (on top of existing\\nquotas], but rather, only a series of individual\\nvoluntary cut announcements. We view this as a\\nsign of possible discord, and so we do see some\\nrisk that adherence to individual cuts may slip in\\n2024.\\n\\nDemand for crude oil has returned to pre-\\npandemic levels, and recent refinery utilization has\\nbeen in the 92% range, which we consider solid. In\\naddition, U.S. inventory levels of both crude oil and\\ngasoline are 2% below their respective five-year\\naverages. Over the next 12 months, our baseline\\nforecast is for continued demand growth. However,\\nthere is one major wildcard to this scenario which\\nis worth discussing \\u2014 a recession in China. Should\\nthat occur, we believe energy demand could drop\\nconsiderably and send benchmark pricing lower,\\nsince China represents a major chunk of\\nincremental 2024 demand growth. We believe that\\npeak demand for crude oil has not yet arrived,\\neven as efficiency gains blunt some demand\\ngrowth, and even as renewable energy continues\\nto make inroads.\\n\\nDownstream, integrated oils enjoyed a buoyant\\n2022, but less so in 2023, partly from strength\\nin refined product consumption, coupled with\\nlimited supply. Refineries have been running at\\n90% - 95% capacity, helping margins, and the\\nindustry has not replaced capacity that was\\nshut down in the wake of the pandemic. We\\nnote that downstream is fairly concentrated,\\nwith just a handful of major suppliers, which we\\nthink contributes to high pricing. The outlook\\nfor downstream as of late 2023 still looks\\ngood, with a low-90% utilization plus slightly\\nlow inventory levels in gasoline and diesel\\ncontributing to acceptable margins. President\\nBiden\\u2019s willingness to tap the Strategic\\nPetroleum Reserve [SPR] for crude oil simply\\ndue to market conditions, rather than a true\\nsupply shock, could also widen the Brent-WT|\\nspread.\\n\\nThrough November 30, 2023, the SGP\\nIntegrated Oil & Gas Sub-Industry Index was\\ndown 12.0% versus a 17.7% gain in the S&P\\n1500 Composite Index.

Given the favorable\\nenergy commodity prices, ongoing balance\\nsheet deleveraging (gearing ratio has reduced\\nto 20% from 23% at end-2021), and sustained\\ncapex discipline (modest step-up in capex\\nallocation to USD23-27 million), we think Shell\\u2019s\\nshareholder distributions in 2022 will be more\\nthan 30% of its operating cash flow. If\\nmaterialized, this will be above its capital\\nallocation framework (20-30% of its operating\\ncash flow], and could bring Shell\\u2019s 2022 cash\\nyield to the mid-teen percentage, in our view.\\nOperationally, we remain confident on Shell's\\nlong-term prospects, given [i] its positioning in\\nthe global LNG market, which placed it well to\\nbenefit from ongoing energy transition; (ii) low-\\ncost oil & gas asset portfolio; and [iii] strong\\ndownstream franchise, particularly in\\npetrochemical and marketing activities.\\n\\n> Major downside risks include a downturn in\\nhydrocarbon prices, deterioration in oil refining\\nmargin, and cost overruns/delays in\\ndevelopment projects.\\n\\n> We lift our 12-month target price for Shell to\\nUSD55 (USD54}, reflecting a P/NAV of 0.9x, a\\ndiscount to peer P/NAV average of 1.2x, justified\\nin our view by Shell\\u2019s lower ROE and shorter\\nreserve life.\\n\\nLOW MEDIUM HIGH\\n\\nOur risk assessment reflects Shell\\u2019s well-diversified\\noperations across the entire energy value chain.

Today, Shell is one of\\nthe world\\u2019s largest integrated oil and gas companies with operations in more than 70 countries and is widely\\nconsidered to be one of the seven oil supermajors. Shell is primarily listed on the London Stock Exchange\\nwith secondary listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is a\\nconstituent of FTSE 100 Index. As of February 12, 2021, The Capital Group is effectively the largest\\nshareholder with a 5% stake in the firm.\\n\\nDIVISIONAL OVERVIEW: Shell has five reporting segments - Integrated Gas, Upstream, Oil Products,\\nChemicals and Corporate. Integrated Gas (45% of 2021 normalized earnings) business focuses on liquefying\\nnatural gas (LNG) for transportation to customers around the world. The company is a global LNG leader\\nwith sales of 64 million tons in 2021, and has some of the world\\u2019s largest and most technologically\\nadvanced liquefaction/regasification plants located in more than 10 countries. The business also includes\\nGas-to-Liquids (GTL} operation that converts natural gas into liquid products, as well as New Energies\\nportfolio that encompasses Shell's interests in new transportation fuels such as biofuels, hydrogen, and\\nelectric vehicle charging.\\n\\nUpstream operations (41% of 2021 normalized earnings) mainly involve Exploration & Production activities\\nthat search for and recover oil and natural gas around the world. Many of these activities are carried out as\\njoint venture partnerships, often with national oil companies. It has net proved hydrocarbon reserves of\\nabout 9.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with 1.2 billion boe of production in 2021. Close to 40% of\\nthe reserves are located in Asia, with the remaining broadly split as: 8% Europe, 14% Oceania, 8% Africa,\\n19% North America, and 11% South America.\\n\\nThe Oil Products segment (20% of 2021 normalized earnings) comprises: [i] Refining - manufacturing of\\nrefined products including gasoline, diesel, heating oil, aviation fuel, lubricants, bitumen and sulphur from\\ncrude oil; (ii) Trading - provides additional profits and support to Shell's businesses by trading hydrocarbon\\nproducts and alternative energy interests; and (iii) Marketing - the sale of refined products for domestic,\\ntransport and industrial uses, as well as operation of pipelines and biofuel refineries. Other downstream\\noperations include Chemicals (9% of 2021 normalized earnings), which involves the production and\\nmarketing of raw materials for plastics, coatings & detergents to industrial customers. Meanwhile, non-\\noperating activities such as headquarters and central functions are placed under the Corporate segment.\\n\\nCORPORATE STRATEGY: Shell aims to position itself as the leader in oil & gas industry, but at the same time,\\nit will pursue opportunities in low-carbon energy as the global energy landscape continues to transform. The\\nfirm currently views its upstream operations, including deep water, shales, and conventional oil & gas, as\\ncore cash generative engines, and gives priority to businesses that align with its target to reach net-zero\\ncarbon emissions by 2050, specifically in Marketing, Renewables, and Energy Solutions, while Integrated\\nGas, Oil Products, and Chemical\\u2019s activities are still deemed to be essential to support the energy transition.\\n\\nDespite the improvement in market environment, Shell\\u2019s capital allocation plan remains conservative in our\\nview. It will retain annual capex in the range of USD19-22 billion and keep underlying opex at below USD35\\nbillion. At the same time, it will continue divesting non-strategic assets at an annual average of around\\nUSD4 billion to high-grade its portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders will still be rewarded by progressive\\ndividend growth of around 4% each year, as well as additional cash return via share buybacks that will bring\\ntotal shareholders distributions to around 20-30% of cash flow from operations.\\n\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS: Shell's financial performance recovered in 2021 with adjusted earnings nearly\\nquadrupled Y/Y to USD19.3 billion, leading to a sharp rebound in return on average capital employed to 8.5%\\nfrom 2.9% in prior year. Coupled with sustained capital and cost discipline, free cash flow close to doubled\\nand net gearing was reduced to 23.1% by the end of 2021. We believe Shell is now in a strong position to\\npursue further share buybacks and raise dividend payout, in view of the firmer energy market outlook.\\n\\nCorporate information\\n\\nInvestor contact\\nT.

By definition, integrated oils operate at\\nboth ends of the oil & gas value chain (upstream\\nas well as downstream], although typically\\nupstream is the primary driver for operating\\nprofits. Benchmark crude oil prices in the low\\n$100/barrel range is welcoming news, following a\\n$68/barrel average price in 2021 (and a\\ncalamitous $39/barrrel in 2020). The outlook has\\nbrightened, in our view, on the back of continued\\nsupply discipline from both OPEC and non-OPEC\\nactors.\\n\\nAs the global economy re-emerges from the\\nravages of the pandemic, we think there is pent-\\nup demand that likely puts a floor under oil and\\ngas consumption. It should raise consumer\\ndemand for refined products as consumers\\nbecome more willing to return to pre-pandemic\\nactivities, helping downstream utilization. In\\naddition, higher refined product demand likely\\npulls incremental demand for crude oil and\\nthereby helps boost benchmark pricing, all else\\nbeing equal. However, there is one major wildcard\\nto this scenario which is worth discussing - a\\nsharp recession (perhaps brought on, ironically, by\\nhigh energy prices). Should that occur, we believe\\nenergy demand could drop considerably and send\\nbenchmark pricing lower. Thus, the OPEC+\\nconsortium is engaging in a bit of a high-wire act:\\ndrive prices to attractively-high levels, but not so\\nhigh such as to send the global economy into a\\nditch. So far through mid-2022, they have been\\nsuccessful, but we think risks remain high.\\n\\nThe OPEC-Plus consortium (led by Saudi Arabia\\nand Russia] is struggling to keep pace with current\\ntargets, both because of below-ground problems\\n{in the case of Nigeria and Angola) as well as\\nabove-ground problems (such as Russia, which is\\nfinding it harder to find buyers of its crude oil\\nfollowing the Ukraine invasion). Looking to the\\nsecond half of 2022, OPEC+ is supposed to unwind\\nabout 2.6 mmb/d of prior cuts (the remnants of\\nits early 2020 supply cut of 9.7 mmb/d], but with\\nRussia such a major piece of overall OPEC+\\n\\nproduction, we think 2023 supply could suffer\\nif the battle in Ukraine persists.\\n\\nDownstream, integrated oils have enjoyed a\\nbuoyant 2022 YTD, partly from strength in\\nrefined product consumption, coupled with\\nlimited supply. Refineries are running at about\\n95% capacity, helping margins, and the\\nindustry has not replaced capacity that was\\nshut down in the wake of the pandemic. We\\nnote that downstream is fairly concentrated,\\nwith just a handful of major suppliers, which we\\nthink contributes to high pricing. The outlook\\nfor downstream as of June 2022 looks highly\\nimproved, with strong utilization plus low\\ninventory levels in gasoline and diesel\\ncontributing to wide margins. President Biden\\u2019s\\nwillingness to tap the SPR for crude oil simply\\ndue to market conditions, rather than a true\\nsupply shock, could also widen the Brent-WT|\\nspread.\\n\\nThrough June 30, the S&P Integrated Oil & Gas\\nSub-Industry Index was up 35.8%, versus a\\n20.5% decline in the SGP 1500 Composite\\nIndex.

At the same time, its\\nPayara start-up is expected to come online at\\nthe end of \\u201823, with approximately 220k b/d of\\ngross production. We think Guyana represents\\nsignificant growth opportunities for HES and\\nview some of its other key regions (such as the\\nBakken and Gulf of Mexico) as ancillary pieces\\nthat provide needed cash flow to underwrite\\nGuyana. In Q2 \\u201823, HES announced oil discovery\\nat its Pickerel-1 Exploration well in the Gulf of\\n\\nMexico, and expects to reach first oil in mid-\\u201924.\\n\\n> In Q2 \\u201823, HES revised its \\u201823 production\\nguidance to 385,000-390,000 boe/d (vs. prior\\n365,000-375,000 boe/d) due to better-than-\\nexpected recovery and higher uptimes in the\\nBakken and the expected start of the Payara\\ndevelopment in Guyana early in early Q4 \\u201823.\\n\\n> Although slightly over-levered versus peers,\\nHES\\u2019s balance sheet is improving with $2.2B in\\ncash at the end of Q2 \\u201823 [vs. $2.1B in Q1 \\u201822)\\nand currently has a net debt-to-EBITDAX of\\n1.6x.\\n\\nInvestment Rationale/Risk\\n\\n> Our recommendation is Hold, recently cut from\\n\\nBuy. HES is starting to add capital back to the\\nBakken Shale (with crude oil prices at $73 per\\nbarrel], but we still think prospects offshore\\nGuyana remain the primary catalyst for the\\nstock (46% of \\u201823 capex budget]. HES\\u2019s 30%\\nnon-operator stake in Guyana includes key mid-\\nterm milestones, such as the Payara prospect,\\nwhich will add 220,000 b/d (expected in late\\n23), and achieving the first production in the\\nYellowtail prospect (expected by \\u201825).

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.] is a global oil & gas exploration &\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC),\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES a pure-play upstream oil & gas company.\\n\\nAs of the end of 202, HES had proved reserves of 1.26 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe)}, down 4% from\\nthe end of 2021. Proved reserves skew 80% liquids/20% natural gas. Geographically, 885 million boe of the\\nend of 2022 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (295 million boe} and\\nMalaysia (66 million boe).\\n\\nDuring 2022, HES averaged 344,000 boe/d of production (72% liquids, 28% natural gas), up 9% from 2021.\\nFor 2023, as of May, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by ~8%% to\\n370,000 boe/d.\\n\\nHES held approximately 466,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2022. Prior to Covid-19, HES\\noperated six rigs in the region but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline\\nin energy prices. From February 2021 to August 2021, HES added a second operated rig, a third rig in\\nSeptember 2021, and a fourth rig in July 2022. The company plans to operate four rigs during 2023 while\\ndrilling 110 wells and bringing 110 wells on production. The company drilled 78 wells in 2022 in this region\\nand brought a total of 59 wells on production. Overall, it expects Bakken production to average 167,500 boe/\\ndin 2023, an uptick of 13,500 boe/d from 2022 levels.\\n\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nWestern countries led to the banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR] for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with their growing supply\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand.\\n\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent\\nelection.\\n\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day.\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\n\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets;\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\n\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2022 stood at $2.5 billion, down 7% from 2021. HES ended 2022\\nwith a net debt to capital ratio of 38%, above the ~24% peer average, with no major principal repayment due\\nuntil 2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from May 2023,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $79/b in 2023 and $74/b in 2024.\\n\\nCorporate information\\n\\nInvestor contact\\nJ.

Our\\nchange in outlook is predicated on a more wary\\nview on demand, as concerns over the health of\\nthe global economy seem to be on the rise. At the\\nsame time, major producers have continued to\\ntake a relatively conservative approach on\\nspending for 2023, with U.S. majors choosing free\\ncash flow over production growth, and key OPEC+\\nmembers seeking production cuts to help buttress\\npricing. So long as key OPEC+ players Saudi Arabia\\nand Russia remain on the same page (which has\\nnot always been the case], we think a muted\\nsupply outlook balances out the concerns on the\\ndemand front.\\n\\nFor 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA)\\nexpects oil demand to reach a record high of\\n102.0 mmb/d, up 2.2 mmb/d over 2022. However,\\nachieving this level is mainly contingent on help\\nfrom non-OECD countries (+1.8 mmb/d}, rather\\nthan from OECD countries ([+0.3 mmb/d). Thus, as\\ngoes the economic outlook for China and India, so\\ngoes this forecast, in our view. As of May 2023, the\\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\\nforecasts West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil\\nprices averaging $74/barrel in 2023 and $69/\\nbarrel in 2024. These forecasts imply some degree\\nof pricing degradation looming versus 2022's $95/\\nbarrel. We do anticipate that ESPs (particularly\\nthose that stayed unhedged in 2022 and enjoyed\\nhigh-realized prices) will generate lower earnings\\nin 2023 than they did in 2022, because the pricing\\neffect will likely dominate any small increase in\\nvolumes. Still, on the whole, the absolute level of\\nearnings should be fairly strong, as most EGPs\\ntoday feature strong balance sheets, their cost\\nstructures are in good shape, and the conservative\\napproach to spending should yield strong free\\ncash flows. As a result, we still expect EGPs to\\nsupport dividend and buyback programs, although\\nfirms that offer variable dividends should generate\\nlower yields than in 2022.\\n\\nWe see about a 9% increase in ESP capital\\nspending for 2023, which reflects a combination\\n\\nof organic growth in drill bit activity plus minor\\ncost inflation. For 2024, we think ESPs will\\nincrease capex by about 2% over projected\\n2023 levels.\\n\\nCommercial crude inventories stood at 460\\nmillion barrels in late May 2023, 2% below the\\nfive-year average for this time of year. The\\ncrude oil futures curve is currently in only slight\\nbackwardation, which does not really\\nincentivize further storage. The Biden\\nAdministration withdrew crude oil from the\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 in order\\nto blunt high prices, but with the SPR at just\\n50% of capacity as of May 2023 (from 84% in\\nNovember 2021], we see little likelihood of the\\nsame pace in 2023.\\n\\nThe U.S. EIA noted that the U.S. working gas in\\nstorage stood at 2.45 tcf as of late May 2023,\\n17% above the five-year average for this time.\\nThe EIA also projects Henry HUB natural gas\\nprices to average $2.91/MMBtu in 2023 [well\\nbelow the average of $6.42/MMBtu in 2022),\\nrising to $3.72/MMBtu in 2024.\\n\\nYear-to-date through May 31, the S&P Oil &\\nGas Exploration & Production Index was down\\n15.0%, versus an 8.0% gain in the SGP 1500\\nComposite Index. In 202e, the sub-industry\\nwas up 49%, while the SGP 1500 fell 19%.\\n\\n| Stewart Glickman, CFA\\n\\nGICS Sector: Energy\\n\\nSub-Industry: Oil and Gas Exploration and Production\\nBased on S&P 1500 Indexes\\n\\nFive-Year market price performance through Aug 19, 2023\\n\\n\\u2014 NYSE:HES \\u2014\\u2014 Sub-Industry ~~ S&P 1500\\n160% ~\\n120% ~\\n80% ~\\no\\nan\\nCc\\na\\nS 40% +\\nae\\n0% ~\\n40% +\\n-B0% ~\\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\\nNOTE: A sector chart appears when the sub-industry does not have\\nsufficient historical index data.\\n\\nAll Sector & Sub-Industry information is based on the Global Industry\\nClassification Standard (GICS}.\\n\\nPast performance is not an indication of future performance and should\\nnot be relied upon as such.\\n\\nSource: CFRA, S&P Global Market Intelligence\\n\\nStock\\nPeer Group Symbol\\nHess Corporation HES\\nCanadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ\\nCoterra Energy Inc.

Devon has\\na highly productive portfolio of top-tier assets, mostly located in shale-rich basins with\\nrelatively low extraction costs. This provides the company with a competitive advantage,\\nespecially with oil prices above $50 per barrel. We also believe that DVN offers value\\nbased on its strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity. In the current environment, the\\ncompany is focused on recalibrating drilling and completion activity and lowering\\noperating costs.\\n\\nWe expect Devon to emerge from the current downturn as a stronger company, helped\\nby its merger with WPX Energy, which closed on January 7, 2021. The combined\\ncompany is now a leading U.S. unconventional oil producer, with a premium acreage\\nposition in the Delaware Basin. Management expects the new company to post higher\\nmargins and free cash flow, and to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through a\\nfixed-plus-variable dividend policy - the first such program in the Energy industry. We also\\nexpect the company to benefit from WPX's 'nonfederal' acreage, which should provide\\n\\nNYSE: DVN\\n\\nDEVON ENERGY CORP\\n\\nReport created Feb 18, 2021 Page 1 OF 5\\n\\nArgus Recommendations\\n\\nTwelve Month Rating\\n\\nFive Year Rating\\n\\nSector Rating faa\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nArgus assigns a 12-month BUY, HOLD, or SELL rating to each\\n\\nstock under coverage.\\n\\ne BUY-rated stocks are expected to outperform the market (the\\nbenchmark S&P 500 Index) on a risk-adjusted basis over the\\n\\nnext year.\\n\\n\\u00a2 HOLD-rated stocks are expected to perform in line with the\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\n\\u00a2 SELL-rated stocks are expected to underperform the market\\n\\non a risk-adjusted basis.\\n\\nThe distribution of ratings across Argus' entire company\\n\\nuniverse is: 67% Buy, 33% Hold.\\n\\nMarket Data pricing reflects previous trading week's closing price.\\n\\n\\u2014200-Day Moving Average Target Price: $25.00 -\\u00ae52 Week High: $21.98 -O-52 Week Low: $16.11 @Closed at $19.98 on 2/12\\n\\nPrice\\n(8)\\n\\nRating BUY\\nHOLD\\n\\nSELL\\n\\n0.13\\nQuarterly ||\\n\\nAnnual 1.38 -0.03\\n\\nRevenue\\n($ in Bil.)\\n\\nEPS\\n(8)\\n\\n1.09 (m\\u2122 Estimate) 1.78 (m Estimate)\\n\\nQuarterly\\n\\nAnnual F 48 8.1 (m Estimate) 8.5 (m Estimate)\\n\\nFY ends ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai 7] a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4\\nDec 31 2019 2020 2021 2022\\n\\nKey Statistics\\n\\nKey Statistics pricing data reflects previous trading day's closing\\nprice.

On valuation, DVN continues to trade at a\\nsignificant discount to peers, which we believe is unwarranted. Our\\nrevised target price is $25, raised from $20.\\n\\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\n\\nOn February 16, Devon posted a 4Q20 adjusted net loss of $3\\nmillion or $0.01 per share, down from an adjusted net profit of\\n$128 million or $0.33 per share in 4Q19. We had expected EPS of\\n$0.02; the consensus EPS estimate was $0.03.\\n\\nThe swing to an adjusted operating loss was driven by lower\\nproduction, lower crude oil price realizations (down 25% from the\\nprior year), and lower overall revenue.\\n\\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.280 billion fell 20% from the\\nprior year but topped the StreetAccount consensus of $1.150\\nbillion. Net production averaged 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent\\nper day (boe/d), down 3% from 4Q19.\\n\\nThe company's average realized price for crude oil, including\\nthe impact of hedging, fell 25% year-over-year, to $42.65 per\\nbarrel. The average realized price for NGLs improved 7% to\\n$20.01 per barrel, and the average realized price for natural gas\\nrose 7% to $2.67 per mcf.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2021, Devon and WPX Energy completed their\\nall-stock 'merger of equals' transaction. The combined company,\\nwhich retains the Devon name, has an enterprise value in excess of\\n$12 billion.

We see the main benefit of the\\nmerger as greater scale in the Delaware Basin, one of the most\\nproductive and lowest-cost shale oil basins in the U.S.\\n\\nIn 2020, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $0.03 per\\nshare, compared to an adjusted net profit of $1.38 per diluted\\nshare in 2019.\\n\\nEARNINGS & GROWTH ANALYSIS\\n\\nReflecting recent better-than-expected results in the Delaware\\nBasin, Devon has raised its 2021 oil production forecast to\\n280,000-300,000 barrels per day, up from a prior forecast of\\n\\u2018greater than 280,000 barrels per day.' Devon expects to deliver\\nthis improved production with an upstream capital budget of\\n$1.6-$1.8 billion.\\n\\nManagement will provide 1Q21 guidance once it can assess the\\nimpact of the current extreme winter weather on its field\\noperations. Devon has incorporated weather-related downtime in\\nits 2021 outlook and does not expect the severe weather to\\nmaterially impact its full-year guidance.\\n\\nWe are raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $1.09 from $0.63 to\\nreflect both management's revised production guidance and our\\nhigher average crude oil price forecast of $53 per barrel, up from a\\nprior $41.

Phillips 66 was formed through a\\nspinoff from ConocoPhillips on May 1, 2012.\\n\\nRefining is a volatile and environmentally high-risk business.\\nEarnings can swing sharply from quarter to quarter, and the risk of\\nenvironmental problems is high.

Its\\nrefining and marketing operations include 14 refineries with net\\ncrude capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day. Its Chemicals\\noperations are conducted through a 50% interest in Chevron\\nPhillips Chemical Company LLC, which has more than 33 billion\\npounds of net annual processing capacity. Midstream operations\\nare conducted through a 50% interest in DCP Midstream, LLC and\\nthrough the company's controlling stake in Phillips 66 Partners.\\nPhillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on\\nMay 1, 2012.\\n\\nVALUATION\\n\\nPhillips 66 shares have traded between $78.44 and $123.97\\nover the past 52 weeks and are currently above the midpoint of the\\nrange. The shares are trading at 12.8-times our 2019 EPS estimate\\nand 9.7-times our 2020 estimate, compared to a seven-year average\\nannual range of 11-19. They are also trading below the midpoint\\nof their historical average range for price/book (1.9 versus a range\\nof 1.6-2.3). The shares are trading at a price/sales ratio of 0.4\\nversus a historical average range of 0.3-0.5; at a price/EBITDA\\nmultiple of 8.9, versus an average annual range of 9.9-17.5; and at\\na price/cash flow multiple of 7.7, versus a range of 7.6-13.7. They\\nare trading below the peer average for most valuation metrics.\\n\\nWe believe that many energy sector investors continue to\\noverlook PSX due to volatile operating conditions in the refining\\nindustry; however, results in this segment have been strong and we\\nexpect solid results if crude oil prices remain at or near $55 per\\nbarrel (they are currently near $57).\\n\\nLooking ahead, we expect the shares to benefit from stronger\\nmargins and earnings, driven by stronger crude oil prices,\\nimproving industry fundamentals, and the company's focus on\\ndividend increases and stock buybacks.\\n\\nOn July 30 at midday, BUY-rated PSX traded at $102.62, down\\n$0.18.\\n\\nNYSE: PSX\\n\\nPHILLIPS 66\\n\\nReport created Jul 29, 2019 Page 40F5\\n\\nPlease see important information about this report on page 5\\n\\n\\u00a92019 Argus Research Company\\n\\nArgus Analyst Report\\n\\n(Arcus\\n\\nAbout Argus\\n\\nArgus Research, founded by Economist Harold Dorsey in 1934,\\nhas built a top-down, fundamental system that is used by Argus\\nanalysts.

At the same time, its\\nPayara start-up is expected to come online at\\nthe end of \\u201823, with approximately 220k b/d of\\ngross production. We think Guyana represents\\nsignificant growth opportunities for HES and\\nview some of its other key regions (such as the\\nBakken and Gulf of Mexico) as ancillary pieces\\nthat provide needed cash flow to underwrite\\nGuyana. In Q2 \\u201823, HES announced oil discovery\\nat its Pickerel-1 Exploration well in the Gulf of\\n\\nMexico, and expects to reach first oil in mid-\\u201924.\\n\\n> In Q2 \\u201823, HES revised its \\u201823 production\\nguidance to 385,000-390,000 boe/d (vs. prior\\n365,000-375,000 boe/d) due to better-than-\\nexpected recovery and higher uptimes in the\\nBakken and the expected start of the Payara\\ndevelopment in Guyana early in early Q4 \\u201823.\\n\\n> Although slightly over-levered versus peers,\\nHES\\u2019s balance sheet is improving with $2.2B in\\ncash at the end of Q2 \\u201823 [vs. $2.1B in Q1 \\u201822)\\nand currently has a net debt-to-EBITDAX of\\n1.6x.\\n\\nInvestment Rationale/Risk\\n\\n> Our recommendation is Hold, recently cut from\\n\\nBuy. HES is starting to add capital back to the\\nBakken Shale (with crude oil prices at $73 per\\nbarrel], but we still think prospects offshore\\nGuyana remain the primary catalyst for the\\nstock (46% of \\u201823 capex budget]. HES\\u2019s 30%\\nnon-operator stake in Guyana includes key mid-\\nterm milestones, such as the Payara prospect,\\nwhich will add 220,000 b/d (expected in late\\n23), and achieving the first production in the\\nYellowtail prospect (expected by \\u201825). However,\\nwe think HES's modest hedge production for '23\\ncould provide little downside protection [we\\nestimate ~34% of expected \\u201823 production\\nhedged; 20% at $70/b WTI and 13% at $75/b\\nBrent] should a recession occur (not our base\\ncase, but a risk nonetheless).\\n\\n> Risks to our recommendation and target price\\n\\ninclude falling crude oil prices, a weaker-than-\\nexpected ability to replace proved reserves,\\nunfavorable U.S. regulatory developments,\\nunfavorable political developments in Guyana,\\nand rising cost inflation.\\n\\n> Our 12-month price target of $152 is derived\\n\\nfrom an applied 10.9x multiple of enterprise\\nvalue to projected \\u201924 EBITDA, above HES\\u2019s\\nhistorical forward average.

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.] is a global oil & gas exploration &\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC),\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES a pure-play upstream oil & gas company.\\n\\nAs of the end of 202, HES had proved reserves of 1.26 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe)}, down 4% from\\nthe end of 2021. Proved reserves skew 80% liquids/20% natural gas. Geographically, 885 million boe of the\\nend of 2022 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (295 million boe} and\\nMalaysia (66 million boe).\\n\\nDuring 2022, HES averaged 344,000 boe/d of production (72% liquids, 28% natural gas), up 9% from 2021.\\nFor 2023, as of May, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by ~8%% to\\n370,000 boe/d.\\n\\nHES held approximately 466,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2022. Prior to Covid-19, HES\\noperated six rigs in the region but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline\\nin energy prices. From February 2021 to August 2021, HES added a second operated rig, a third rig in\\nSeptember 2021, and a fourth rig in July 2022. The company plans to operate four rigs during 2023 while\\ndrilling 110 wells and bringing 110 wells on production. The company drilled 78 wells in 2022 in this region\\nand brought a total of 59 wells on production. Overall, it expects Bakken production to average 167,500 boe/\\ndin 2023, an uptick of 13,500 boe/d from 2022 levels.\\n\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nWestern countries led to the banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR] for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with their growing supply\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand.\\n\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent\\nelection.\\n\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day.\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\n\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets;\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\n\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2022 stood at $2.5 billion, down 7% from 2021. HES ended 2022\\nwith a net debt to capital ratio of 38%, above the ~24% peer average, with no major principal repayment due\\nuntil 2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from May 2023,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $79/b in 2023 and $74/b in 2024.\\n\\nCorporate information\\n\\nInvestor contact\\nJ.

Our\\nchange in outlook is predicated on a more wary\\nview on demand, as concerns over the health of\\nthe global economy seem to be on the rise. At the\\nsame time, major producers have continued to\\ntake a relatively conservative approach on\\nspending for 2023, with U.S. majors choosing free\\ncash flow over production growth, and key OPEC+\\nmembers seeking production cuts to help buttress\\npricing. So long as key OPEC+ players Saudi Arabia\\nand Russia remain on the same page (which has\\nnot always been the case], we think a muted\\nsupply outlook balances out the concerns on the\\ndemand front.\\n\\nFor 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA)\\nexpects oil demand to reach a record high of\\n102.0 mmb/d, up 2.2 mmb/d over 2022. However,\\nachieving this level is mainly contingent on help\\nfrom non-OECD countries (+1.8 mmb/d}, rather\\nthan from OECD countries ([+0.3 mmb/d). Thus, as\\ngoes the economic outlook for China and India, so\\ngoes this forecast, in our view. As of May 2023, the\\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\\nforecasts West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil\\nprices averaging $74/barrel in 2023 and $69/\\nbarrel in 2024. These forecasts imply some degree\\nof pricing degradation looming versus 2022's $95/\\nbarrel. We do anticipate that ESPs (particularly\\nthose that stayed unhedged in 2022 and enjoyed\\nhigh-realized prices) will generate lower earnings\\nin 2023 than they did in 2022, because the pricing\\neffect will likely dominate any small increase in\\nvolumes. Still, on the whole, the absolute level of\\nearnings should be fairly strong, as most EGPs\\ntoday feature strong balance sheets, their cost\\nstructures are in good shape, and the conservative\\napproach to spending should yield strong free\\ncash flows. As a result, we still expect EGPs to\\nsupport dividend and buyback programs, although\\nfirms that offer variable dividends should generate\\nlower yields than in 2022.\\n\\nWe see about a 9% increase in ESP capital\\nspending for 2023, which reflects a combination\\n\\nof organic growth in drill bit activity plus minor\\ncost inflation. For 2024, we think ESPs will\\nincrease capex by about 2% over projected\\n2023 levels.\\n\\nCommercial crude inventories stood at 460\\nmillion barrels in late May 2023, 2% below the\\nfive-year average for this time of year. The\\ncrude oil futures curve is currently in only slight\\nbackwardation, which does not really\\nincentivize further storage. The Biden\\nAdministration withdrew crude oil from the\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 in order\\nto blunt high prices, but with the SPR at just\\n50% of capacity as of May 2023 (from 84% in\\nNovember 2021], we see little likelihood of the\\nsame pace in 2023.\\n\\nThe U.S. EIA noted that the U.S. working gas in\\nstorage stood at 2.45 tcf as of late May 2023,\\n17% above the five-year average for this time.\\nThe EIA also projects Henry HUB natural gas\\nprices to average $2.91/MMBtu in 2023 [well\\nbelow the average of $6.42/MMBtu in 2022),\\nrising to $3.72/MMBtu in 2024.\\n\\nYear-to-date through May 31, the S&P Oil &\\nGas Exploration & Production Index was down\\n15.0%, versus an 8.0% gain in the SGP 1500\\nComposite Index.

The 2022 consensus is $1.64.\\n\\nINVESTMENT THESIS\\n\\nWe are reaffirming our BUY rating on Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN). Devon has\\na highly productive portfolio of top-tier assets, mostly located in shale-rich basins with\\nrelatively low extraction costs. This provides the company with a competitive advantage,\\nespecially with oil prices above $50 per barrel. We also believe that DVN offers value\\nbased on its strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity. In the current environment, the\\ncompany is focused on recalibrating drilling and completion activity and lowering\\noperating costs.\\n\\nWe expect Devon to emerge from the current downturn as a stronger company, helped\\nby its merger with WPX Energy, which closed on January 7, 2021. The combined\\ncompany is now a leading U.S. unconventional oil producer, with a premium acreage\\nposition in the Delaware Basin. Management expects the new company to post higher\\nmargins and free cash flow, and to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through a\\nfixed-plus-variable dividend policy - the first such program in the Energy industry. We also\\nexpect the company to benefit from WPX's 'nonfederal' acreage, which should provide\\n\\nNYSE: DVN\\n\\nDEVON ENERGY CORP\\n\\nReport created Feb 18, 2021 Page 1 OF 5\\n\\nArgus Recommendations\\n\\nTwelve Month Rating\\n\\nFive Year Rating\\n\\nSector Rating faa\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nArgus assigns a 12-month BUY, HOLD, or SELL rating to each\\n\\nstock under coverage.\\n\\ne BUY-rated stocks are expected to outperform the market (the\\nbenchmark S&P 500 Index) on a risk-adjusted basis over the\\n\\nnext year.\\n\\n\\u00a2 HOLD-rated stocks are expected to perform in line with the\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\n\\u00a2 SELL-rated stocks are expected to underperform the market\\n\\non a risk-adjusted basis.\\n\\nThe distribution of ratings across Argus' entire company\\n\\nuniverse is: 67% Buy, 33% Hold.\\n\\nMarket Data pricing reflects previous trading week's closing price.\\n\\n\\u2014200-Day Moving Average Target Price: $25.00 -\\u00ae52 Week High: $21.98 -O-52 Week Low: $16.11 @Closed at $19.98 on 2/12\\n\\nPrice\\n(8)\\n\\nRating BUY\\nHOLD\\n\\nSELL\\n\\n0.13\\nQuarterly ||\\n\\nAnnual 1.38 -0.03\\n\\nRevenue\\n($ in Bil.)\\n\\nEPS\\n(8)\\n\\n1.09 (m\\u2122 Estimate) 1.78 (m Estimate)\\n\\nQuarterly\\n\\nAnnual F 48 8.1 (m Estimate) 8.5 (m Estimate)\\n\\nFY ends ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai 7] a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4\\nDec 31 2019 2020 2021 2022\\n\\nKey Statistics\\n\\nKey Statistics pricing data reflects previous trading day's closing\\nprice.

We had expected EPS of\\n$0.02; the consensus EPS estimate was $0.03.\\n\\nThe swing to an adjusted operating loss was driven by lower\\nproduction, lower crude oil price realizations (down 25% from the\\nprior year), and lower overall revenue.\\n\\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.280 billion fell 20% from the\\nprior year but topped the StreetAccount consensus of $1.150\\nbillion. Net production averaged 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent\\nper day (boe/d), down 3% from 4Q19.\\n\\nThe company's average realized price for crude oil, including\\nthe impact of hedging, fell 25% year-over-year, to $42.65 per\\nbarrel. The average realized price for NGLs improved 7% to\\n$20.01 per barrel, and the average realized price for natural gas\\nrose 7% to $2.67 per mcf.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2021, Devon and WPX Energy completed their\\nall-stock 'merger of equals' transaction.

Phillips 66 was formed through a\\nspinoff from ConocoPhillips on May 1, 2012.\\n\\nRefining is a volatile and environmentally high-risk business.\\nEarnings can swing sharply from quarter to quarter, and the risk of\\nenvironmental problems is high. As a result, investors must be\\nprepared for the possibility of lawsuits against the company. In\\naddition, refining companies often have unexpected downtime, and\\neven small operational changes can be dramatically amplified in a\\nrefiner's quarterly results.\\n\\nThe prices of crude oil and refined products materially affect\\nPSX's profitability, and the actual prices of both the feedstock it\\nuses and the finished goods it produces depend on many factors\\nbeyond its control, including general market demand and economic\\nconditions, seasonal and weather-related factors, and government\\nregulations and policies. The company's inability to control these\\nfactors can make margins, cash flow and earnings unpredictable.\\n\\nPSX has incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to\\ncomply with environmental laws and regulations. If it is unable to\\noffset these costs with higher selling prices, they will have a\\nnegative impact on its financial results.\\n\\nCOMPANY DESCRIPTION\\n\\nPhillips 66 is a downstream energy company with assets in four\\nsegments: Refining, Marketing, Chemicals, and Midstream. Its\\nrefining and marketing operations include 14 refineries with net\\ncrude capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day. Its Chemicals\\noperations are conducted through a 50% interest in Chevron\\nPhillips Chemical Company LLC, which has more than 33 billion\\npounds of net annual processing capacity. Midstream operations\\nare conducted through a 50% interest in DCP Midstream, LLC and\\nthrough the company's controlling stake in Phillips 66 Partners.\\nPhillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on\\nMay 1, 2012.\\n\\nVALUATION\\n\\nPhillips 66 shares have traded between $78.44 and $123.97\\nover the past 52 weeks and are currently above the midpoint of the\\nrange. The shares are trading at 12.8-times our 2019 EPS estimate\\nand 9.7-times our 2020 estimate, compared to a seven-year average\\nannual range of 11-19. They are also trading below the midpoint\\nof their historical average range for price/book (1.9 versus a range\\nof 1.6-2.3). The shares are trading at a price/sales ratio of 0.4\\nversus a historical average range of 0.3-0.5; at a price/EBITDA\\nmultiple of 8.9, versus an average annual range of 9.9-17.5; and at\\na price/cash flow multiple of 7.7, versus a range of 7.6-13.7. They\\nare trading below the peer average for most valuation metrics.\\n\\nWe believe that many energy sector investors continue to\\noverlook PSX due to volatile operating conditions in the refining\\nindustry; however, results in this segment have been strong and we\\nexpect solid results if crude oil prices remain at or near $55 per\\nbarrel (they are currently near $57).\\n\\nLooking ahead, we expect the shares to benefit from stronger\\nmargins and earnings, driven by stronger crude oil prices,\\nimproving industry fundamentals, and the company's focus on\\ndividend increases and stock buybacks.\\n\\nOn July 30 at midday, BUY-rated PSX traded at $102.62, down\\n$0.18.\\n\\nNYSE: PSX\\n\\nPHILLIPS 66\\n\\nReport created Jul 29, 2019 Page 40F5\\n\\nPlease see important information about this report on page 5\\n\\n\\u00a92019 Argus Research Company\\n\\nArgus Analyst Report\\n\\n(Arcus\\n\\nAbout Argus\\n\\nArgus Research, founded by Economist Harold Dorsey in 1934,\\nhas built a top-down, fundamental system that is used by Argus\\nanalysts.

At the same time, its\\nPayara start-up is expected to come online at\\nthe end of \\u201823, with approximately 220k b/d of\\ngross production. We think Guyana represents\\nsignificant growth opportunities for HES and\\nview some of its other key regions (such as the\\nBakken and Gulf of Mexico) as ancillary pieces\\nthat provide needed cash flow to underwrite\\nGuyana. In Q2 \\u201823, HES announced oil discovery\\nat its Pickerel-1 Exploration well in the Gulf of\\n\\nMexico, and expects to reach first oil in mid-\\u201924.\\n\\n> In Q2 \\u201823, HES revised its \\u201823 production\\nguidance to 385,000-390,000 boe/d (vs. prior\\n365,000-375,000 boe/d) due to better-than-\\nexpected recovery and higher uptimes in the\\nBakken and the expected start of the Payara\\ndevelopment in Guyana early in early Q4 \\u201823.\\n\\n> Although slightly over-levered versus peers,\\nHES\\u2019s balance sheet is improving with $2.2B in\\ncash at the end of Q2 \\u201823 [vs. $2.1B in Q1 \\u201822)\\nand currently has a net debt-to-EBITDAX of\\n1.6x.\\n\\nInvestment Rationale/Risk\\n\\n> Our recommendation is Hold, recently cut from\\n\\nBuy. HES is starting to add capital back to the\\nBakken Shale (with crude oil prices at $73 per\\nbarrel], but we still think prospects offshore\\nGuyana remain the primary catalyst for the\\nstock (46% of \\u201823 capex budget]. HES\\u2019s 30%\\nnon-operator stake in Guyana includes key mid-\\nterm milestones, such as the Payara prospect,\\nwhich will add 220,000 b/d (expected in late\\n23), and achieving the first production in the\\nYellowtail prospect (expected by \\u201825).

Hess Corp. (HES; formerly Amerada Hess Corp.] is a global oil & gas exploration &\\nproduction company. In September 2014, HES closed a deal with Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC),\\nunder which HES sold its former retail operations to MPC for total proceeds of $2.87 billion. The deal\\nrendered HES a pure-play upstream oil & gas company.\\n\\nAs of the end of 202, HES had proved reserves of 1.26 billion barrels of oil equivalent (bboe)}, down 4% from\\nthe end of 2021. Proved reserves skew 80% liquids/20% natural gas. Geographically, 885 million boe of the\\nend of 2022 estimated proved reserves were located in the U.S., followed by Guyana (295 million boe} and\\nMalaysia (66 million boe).\\n\\nDuring 2022, HES averaged 344,000 boe/d of production (72% liquids, 28% natural gas), up 9% from 2021.\\nFor 2023, as of May, S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates suggest total production will grow by ~8%% to\\n370,000 boe/d.\\n\\nHES held approximately 466,000 net acres in the Bakken Shale as of the end of 2022. Prior to Covid-19, HES\\noperated six rigs in the region but reduced the rig count to one in May 2020 in response to the sharp decline\\nin energy prices. From February 2021 to August 2021, HES added a second operated rig, a third rig in\\nSeptember 2021, and a fourth rig in July 2022. The company plans to operate four rigs during 2023 while\\ndrilling 110 wells and bringing 110 wells on production. The company drilled 78 wells in 2022 in this region\\nand brought a total of 59 wells on production. Overall, it expects Bakken production to average 167,500 boe/\\ndin 2023, an uptick of 13,500 boe/d from 2022 levels.\\n\\nIMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. At the end of April 2022, the ongoing conflict between Russia and\\nWestern countries led to the banning of some Russian oil imports, while other countries reduced their\\nreliance on Russian oil. While global supply was already inadequately equipped to meet the increase in\\ndemand, the ongoing conflict has led Western countries to release oil from their emergency reserves to\\nalleviate the rising economic stress. The Biden administration announced that it will release 1 mmb/d from\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR] for six months (totaling around 180 million barrels), starting in May\\n2022, to assist consumers both domestically and internationally. If the SPR release is realized, over the long\\nterm, we think it could create a smaller buffer, putting upward pressure on oil prices. With European\\ncountries beginning to look for oil from more politically stable countries to assist with their growing supply\\nshock, we think HES could benefit from the increasing international demand.\\n\\nIn November 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) and TotalEnergies SE (TTE FP) agreed to acquire HES\\u2019s 8.16% stake\\nin Waha oil fields, with the stake to be split evenly between the two companies. The transaction was\\napproved by the Council of Ministers of the Government of National Unity, but is still pending final\\ngovernment approval, which has been delayed given recent civil unrest from the region\\u2019s most recent\\nelection.\\n\\nHES is a 30% stakeholder in the Stabroek block offshore Guyana; 18 discoveries have been made since\\n2015. One such discovery, Liza, is being developed in phases. Phase 1 achieved its first production in\\nDecember 2019 and reached full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels per day in late 2020. Phase 2 of Liza\\nachieved its first production in February 2022, with production capacity at 220,000 gross barrels per day.\\nUltimately, HES sees a production objective from Stabroek of 750,000 gross barrels per day, but due to the\\npandemic, it now sees this being achieved by 2026.\\n\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE. In January 2013, privately held Elliott Management Corporation notified HES that\\nit owned 4% of the outstanding common stock of HES. It would nominate five individuals for election to the\\nHES Board of Directors at HES\\u2019s 2013 Annual Meeting. Among other proposals, Elliott also advocated for a\\nspin-off of the company\\u2019s Bakken, Utica, and Eagle Ford acreage; divestiture of HES\\u2019s downstream assets;\\nmoving its midstream assets into an MLP or REIT corporate structure; and further divestment of its\\ninternational portfolio. In May 2013, HES and Elliott settled this potential proxy fight with HES agreeing to\\nadd three Elliott nominees and Elliott agreeing to support HES\\u2019s five nominees. In addition, in May 2013, HES\\nsplit the role of Chairman and CEO, which previously had both been held by John Hess. To that end, HES\\nnominated Dr. Mark Williams as non-executive Chairman, while John Hess retained the position of CEO.\\n\\nFINANCIAL TRENDS. Cash at the end of 2022 stood at $2.5 billion, down 7% from 2021. HES ended 2022\\nwith a net debt to capital ratio of 38%, above the ~24% peer average, with no major principal repayment due\\nuntil 2024. HES has guided that it can achieve 25% growth in its free cash flow from 2021 to 2026 at $65/b\\nBrent oil prices. We believe HES\\u2019s line of sight is reasonable on the basis that we are in the early stages of an\\nenergy upcycle, given that the latest U.S. Energy Information Administration report from May 2023,\\nestimates Brent oil prices to average $79/b in 2023 and $74/b in 2024.\\n\\nCorporate information\\n\\nInvestor contact\\nJ.

Our\\nchange in outlook is predicated on a more wary\\nview on demand, as concerns over the health of\\nthe global economy seem to be on the rise. At the\\nsame time, major producers have continued to\\ntake a relatively conservative approach on\\nspending for 2023, with U.S. majors choosing free\\ncash flow over production growth, and key OPEC+\\nmembers seeking production cuts to help buttress\\npricing. So long as key OPEC+ players Saudi Arabia\\nand Russia remain on the same page (which has\\nnot always been the case], we think a muted\\nsupply outlook balances out the concerns on the\\ndemand front.\\n\\nFor 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA)\\nexpects oil demand to reach a record high of\\n102.0 mmb/d, up 2.2 mmb/d over 2022. However,\\nachieving this level is mainly contingent on help\\nfrom non-OECD countries (+1.8 mmb/d}, rather\\nthan from OECD countries ([+0.3 mmb/d). Thus, as\\ngoes the economic outlook for China and India, so\\ngoes this forecast, in our view. As of May 2023, the\\nU.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\\nforecasts West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil\\nprices averaging $74/barrel in 2023 and $69/\\nbarrel in 2024. These forecasts imply some degree\\nof pricing degradation looming versus 2022's $95/\\nbarrel. We do anticipate that ESPs (particularly\\nthose that stayed unhedged in 2022 and enjoyed\\nhigh-realized prices) will generate lower earnings\\nin 2023 than they did in 2022, because the pricing\\neffect will likely dominate any small increase in\\nvolumes. Still, on the whole, the absolute level of\\nearnings should be fairly strong, as most EGPs\\ntoday feature strong balance sheets, their cost\\nstructures are in good shape, and the conservative\\napproach to spending should yield strong free\\ncash flows. As a result, we still expect EGPs to\\nsupport dividend and buyback programs, although\\nfirms that offer variable dividends should generate\\nlower yields than in 2022.\\n\\nWe see about a 9% increase in ESP capital\\nspending for 2023, which reflects a combination\\n\\nof organic growth in drill bit activity plus minor\\ncost inflation. For 2024, we think ESPs will\\nincrease capex by about 2% over projected\\n2023 levels.\\n\\nCommercial crude inventories stood at 460\\nmillion barrels in late May 2023, 2% below the\\nfive-year average for this time of year. The\\ncrude oil futures curve is currently in only slight\\nbackwardation, which does not really\\nincentivize further storage. The Biden\\nAdministration withdrew crude oil from the\\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022 in order\\nto blunt high prices, but with the SPR at just\\n50% of capacity as of May 2023 (from 84% in\\nNovember 2021], we see little likelihood of the\\nsame pace in 2023.\\n\\nThe U.S. EIA noted that the U.S. working gas in\\nstorage stood at 2.45 tcf as of late May 2023,\\n17% above the five-year average for this time.\\nThe EIA also projects Henry HUB natural gas\\nprices to average $2.91/MMBtu in 2023 [well\\nbelow the average of $6.42/MMBtu in 2022),\\nrising to $3.72/MMBtu in 2024.\\n\\nYear-to-date through May 31, the S&P Oil &\\nGas Exploration & Production Index was down\\n15.0%, versus an 8.0% gain in the SGP 1500\\nComposite Index. In 202e, the sub-industry\\nwas up 49%, while the SGP 1500 fell 19%.\\n\\n| Stewart Glickman, CFA\\n\\nGICS Sector: Energy\\n\\nSub-Industry: Oil and Gas Exploration and Production\\nBased on S&P 1500 Indexes\\n\\nFive-Year market price performance through Aug 19, 2023\\n\\n\\u2014 NYSE:HES \\u2014\\u2014 Sub-Industry ~~ S&P 1500\\n160% ~\\n120% ~\\n80% ~\\no\\nan\\nCc\\na\\nS 40% +\\nae\\n0% ~\\n40% +\\n-B0% ~\\n2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\\nNOTE: A sector chart appears when the sub-industry does not have\\nsufficient historical index data.\\n\\nAll Sector & Sub-Industry information is based on the Global Industry\\nClassification Standard (GICS}.\\n\\nPast performance is not an indication of future performance and should\\nnot be relied upon as such.\\n\\nSource: CFRA, S&P Global Market Intelligence\\n\\nStock\\nPeer Group Symbol\\nHess Corporation HES\\nCanadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ\\nCoterra Energy Inc.

Devon has\\na highly productive portfolio of top-tier assets, mostly located in shale-rich basins with\\nrelatively low extraction costs. This provides the company with a competitive advantage,\\nespecially with oil prices above $50 per barrel. We also believe that DVN offers value\\nbased on its strong balance sheet and substantial liquidity. In the current environment, the\\ncompany is focused on recalibrating drilling and completion activity and lowering\\noperating costs.\\n\\nWe expect Devon to emerge from the current downturn as a stronger company, helped\\nby its merger with WPX Energy, which closed on January 7, 2021. The combined\\ncompany is now a leading U.S. unconventional oil producer, with a premium acreage\\nposition in the Delaware Basin. Management expects the new company to post higher\\nmargins and free cash flow, and to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through a\\nfixed-plus-variable dividend policy - the first such program in the Energy industry. We also\\nexpect the company to benefit from WPX's 'nonfederal' acreage, which should provide\\n\\nNYSE: DVN\\n\\nDEVON ENERGY CORP\\n\\nReport created Feb 18, 2021 Page 1 OF 5\\n\\nArgus Recommendations\\n\\nTwelve Month Rating\\n\\nFive Year Rating\\n\\nSector Rating faa\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nBUY\\n\\nArgus assigns a 12-month BUY, HOLD, or SELL rating to each\\n\\nstock under coverage.\\n\\ne BUY-rated stocks are expected to outperform the market (the\\nbenchmark S&P 500 Index) on a risk-adjusted basis over the\\n\\nnext year.\\n\\n\\u00a2 HOLD-rated stocks are expected to perform in line with the\\n\\nmarket.\\n\\n\\u00a2 SELL-rated stocks are expected to underperform the market\\n\\non a risk-adjusted basis.\\n\\nThe distribution of ratings across Argus' entire company\\n\\nuniverse is: 67% Buy, 33% Hold.\\n\\nMarket Data pricing reflects previous trading week's closing price.\\n\\n\\u2014200-Day Moving Average Target Price: $25.00 -\\u00ae52 Week High: $21.98 -O-52 Week Low: $16.11 @Closed at $19.98 on 2/12\\n\\nPrice\\n(8)\\n\\nRating BUY\\nHOLD\\n\\nSELL\\n\\n0.13\\nQuarterly ||\\n\\nAnnual 1.38 -0.03\\n\\nRevenue\\n($ in Bil.)\\n\\nEPS\\n(8)\\n\\n1.09 (m\\u2122 Estimate) 1.78 (m Estimate)\\n\\nQuarterly\\n\\nAnnual F 48 8.1 (m Estimate) 8.5 (m Estimate)\\n\\nFY ends ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4 ai 7] a2 | a3 | a4 ai | a2 | a3 | a4\\nDec 31 2019 2020 2021 2022\\n\\nKey Statistics\\n\\nKey Statistics pricing data reflects previous trading day's closing\\nprice.

On valuation, DVN continues to trade at a\\nsignificant discount to peers, which we believe is unwarranted. Our\\nrevised target price is $25, raised from $20.\\n\\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\\n\\nOn February 16, Devon posted a 4Q20 adjusted net loss of $3\\nmillion or $0.01 per share, down from an adjusted net profit of\\n$128 million or $0.33 per share in 4Q19. We had expected EPS of\\n$0.02; the consensus EPS estimate was $0.03.\\n\\nThe swing to an adjusted operating loss was driven by lower\\nproduction, lower crude oil price realizations (down 25% from the\\nprior year), and lower overall revenue.\\n\\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.280 billion fell 20% from the\\nprior year but topped the StreetAccount consensus of $1.150\\nbillion. Net production averaged 333,000 barrels of oil equivalent\\nper day (boe/d), down 3% from 4Q19.\\n\\nThe company's average realized price for crude oil, including\\nthe impact of hedging, fell 25% year-over-year, to $42.65 per\\nbarrel. The average realized price for NGLs improved 7% to\\n$20.01 per barrel, and the average realized price for natural gas\\nrose 7% to $2.67 per mcf.\\n\\nOn January 7, 2021, Devon and WPX Energy completed their\\nall-stock 'merger of equals' transaction. The combined company,\\nwhich retains the Devon name, has an enterprise value in excess of\\n$12 billion.

We see the main benefit of the\\nmerger as greater scale in the Delaware Basin, one of the most\\nproductive and lowest-cost shale oil basins in the U.S.\\n\\nIn 2020, the company reported an adjusted net loss of $0.03 per\\nshare, compared to an adjusted net profit of $1.38 per diluted\\nshare in 2019.\\n\\nEARNINGS & GROWTH ANALYSIS\\n\\nReflecting recent better-than-expected results in the Delaware\\nBasin, Devon has raised its 2021 oil production forecast to\\n280,000-300,000 barrels per day, up from a prior forecast of\\n\\u2018greater than 280,000 barrels per day.' Devon expects to deliver\\nthis improved production with an upstream capital budget of\\n$1.6-$1.8 billion.\\n\\nManagement will provide 1Q21 guidance once it can assess the\\nimpact of the current extreme winter weather on its field\\noperations. Devon has incorporated weather-related downtime in\\nits 2021 outlook and does not expect the severe weather to\\nmaterially impact its full-year guidance.\\n\\nWe are raising our 2021 EPS estimate to $1.09 from $0.63 to\\nreflect both management's revised production guidance and our\\nhigher average crude oil price forecast of $53 per barrel, up from a\\nprior $41.

Phillips 66 was formed through a\\nspinoff from ConocoPhillips on May 1, 2012.\\n\\nRefining is a volatile and environmentally high-risk business.\\nEarnings can swing sharply from quarter to quarter, and the risk of\\nenvironmental problems is high.

Its\\nrefining and marketing operations include 14 refineries with net\\ncrude capacity of 2.2 million barrels per day. Its Chemicals\\noperations are conducted through a 50% interest in Chevron\\nPhillips Chemical Company LLC, which has more than 33 billion\\npounds of net annual processing capacity. Midstream operations\\nare conducted through a 50% interest in DCP Midstream, LLC and\\nthrough the company's controlling stake in Phillips 66 Partners.\\nPhillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on\\nMay 1, 2012.\\n\\nVALUATION\\n\\nPhillips 66 shares have traded between $78.44 and $123.97\\nover the past 52 weeks and are currently above the midpoint of the\\nrange. The shares are trading at 12.8-times our 2019 EPS estimate\\nand 9.7-times our 2020 estimate, compared to a seven-year average\\nannual range of 11-19. They are also trading below the midpoint\\nof their historical average range for price/book (1.9 versus a range\\nof 1.6-2.3). The shares are trading at a price/sales ratio of 0.4\\nversus a historical average range of 0.3-0.5; at a price/EBITDA\\nmultiple of 8.9, versus an average annual range of 9.9-17.5; and at\\na price/cash flow multiple of 7.7, versus a range of 7.6-13.7. They\\nare trading below the peer average for most valuation metrics.\\n\\nWe believe that many energy sector investors continue to\\noverlook PSX due to volatile operating conditions in the refining\\nindustry; however, results in this segment have been strong and we\\nexpect solid results if crude oil prices remain at or near $55 per\\nbarrel (they are currently near $57).\\n\\nLooking ahead, we expect the shares to benefit from stronger\\nmargins and earnings, driven by stronger crude oil prices,\\nimproving industry fundamentals, and the company's focus on\\ndividend increases and stock buybacks.\\n\\nOn July 30 at midday, BUY-rated PSX traded at $102.62, down\\n$0.18.\\n\\nNYSE: PSX\\n\\nPHILLIPS 66\\n\\nReport created Jul 29, 2019 Page 40F5\\n\\nPlease see important information about this report on page 5\\n\\n\\u00a92019 Argus Research Company\\n\\nArgus Analyst Report\\n\\n(Arcus\\n\\nAbout Argus\\n\\nArgus Research, founded by Economist Harold Dorsey in 1934,\\nhas built a top-down, fundamental system that is used by Argus\\nanalysts.
