      "Corp.) was engaged in three operating segments: Exploration & Production; Oil Sands Mining, Refining,\n",
      "Marketing, and Transportation; and Integrated Gas. In June 2011, MRO spun off its downstream RM&T\n",

      "The company’s estimated proved reserves, as of December 31, 2023, totaled approximately 1.3 bboe (billion\n",
      "barrels of oil equivalent], in line with 2022 levels. At this estimated level, and assuming that 2023 production\n",
      "levels could be held constant, MRO’s estimated reserve life (the amount of time it would take before such\n",
      "reserves would be exhausted] is 8.9 years, which is well below the peer average of about 15 years. As a\n",
      "result, while replacing reserves is an issue for any oil and gas producer, in our view, this takes on acute\n",
      "significance for MRO.\n",
      "\n",
      "MRO possesses a fairly diverse set of assets in the U.S., with four different regions contributing significant\n",
      "production. The U.S. EGP segment (355,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2023, up 71,000 boe/d\n",
      "versus 2022 production) was comprised of Eagle Ford shale assets in South Texas (151,000 boe/d), the\n",

      "U.S. acreage acquisitions have been fairly frequent in the last few years. In 2018, MRO acquired an additional\n",
      "61,000 acres in Oklahoma, on top of its existing 265,000 acres, which we think will add meaningfully to its\n",

      "Delaware section of the Permian Basin for $1.9 billion, an average price of about $27,000 per acre. We view\n",
      "this as a reasonable price for Permian acreage, although a premium to many other shale plays. In the fourth\n",

      "approximately 40,000 acres in a Texas Delaware oil play in West Texas for $106 million. As of December 31,\n",

      "The company’s International EGP segment (50,000 boe/d in 2023, down 9,000 boe/d from 2022) now\n",
      "consists solely of acreage in Equatorial Guinea.\n",
      "\n",
      "MRO has made recent improvements in its cost structure. In 2023, MRO achieved an average production\n",
      "cost of $10.13/boe, down 3% from $10.42/boe in 2022. Meanwhile, costs in Equatorial Guinea grew 36% to\n",
      "$4.13/boe. Essentially, the gap in costs between the two regions closed, but production costs in Africa\n",
      "remain considerably lower than those in the U.S.\n",

      "IMPACT OF MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS. Over 2017-2020, MRO has steadily pursued non-core asset sales to\n",
      "streamline the company to a handful of core plays. Almost all of this activity has been outside North\n",
      "America, although the largest proceeds came from its 2017 sale of its former Canadian operations for $2.5\n",

      "* **Production:**  The report notes that MRO expects production to remain flat in 2024,  but this is not necessarily a negative sentiment. It reflects a focus on free cash flow over production growth, a common industry trend. \n",
      "* **Reserves / Exploration / Acquisitions / Mergers / Divestments:** The report mentions MRO's reserve life being below the peer average, leading to concerns about reserve replacement. While MRO has been active in acquiring acreage, the report also points out the decline in its net acreage held from 2022 to 2023. This suggests a mixed picture, making the sentiment slightly negative.\n",
      "* **Environment / Regulatory / Geopolitics:** The report mentions potential risks related to regulatory changes in the Bakken Shale and a possible shutdown of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This uncertainty creates a negative sentiment in this category.\n",
      "* **Alternative Energy / Lower Carbon:** There is no mention of alternative energy or lower carbon initiatives in the report.\n",
      "* **Oil Price / Natural Gas Price / Gasoline Price:** The report discusses expectations for flat oil prices in 2024, with a slight improvement in natural gas prices. However, the analyst is wary of MRO's cash flow goals should energy prices fall. Overall, the sentiment is neutral.\n",
