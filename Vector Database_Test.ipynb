Inflation is a big concern, interest rates are still high, and there's worry that we won't see a smooth economic landing and might even hit a recession. On top of that, the S&P 500 has shot up by almost 25% in the past year and is hovering near record highs.\\n\\nWhile it doesn't mean we should follow their every move, given the complicated investing landscape we find ourselves in, it can be useful to peek at what the super-rich are up to with their portfolios. Here's a look at what some top billionaires are selling and buying right now.\\n\\nImage source: Getty Images.\\n\\nA wave of selling unfolds\\n\\nIf you take a quick look around the internet, you'll notice quite a bit of selling going on, and surprisingly, a large chunk of it is CEOs offloading shares of their own companies.\\n\\nAmong the leaders is Jeff Bezos, the former CEO and founder of Amazon. In February, he cashed out 50 million shares, totaling a whopping $8 billion. It marked the first time he'd sold shares since 2023.\\n\\nThen there's Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms. Toward the end of 2023, he parted ways with 1.8 million shares, pocketing nearly $500 million. It was his first round of selling in over two years.\\n\\nNext up is Jamie Dimon, CEO of banking giant JPMorgan Chase. In late February, he sold around $150 million of stock. Although not a relatively huge amount, it was surprising as it was his first time selling shares during his tenure as CEO.\\n\\nThe Walton family, owners of Walmart, also joined the selling spree. Over a two-week period in February, the Walton Family Holding Trust raked in $1.5 billion after selling 8.8 million shares.\\n\\nAnd let's not forget Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and legendary investor. He and his company made headlines by offloading 115 million Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, totaling around $40 billion. While not the CEO of Apple, Buffett's substantial stake in the company made this move quite unexpected.\\n\\nCollectively, these businesses are among the most prominent and high-profile in the world. So, when their CEOs start selling shares, it naturally raises questions. While some sales are part of scheduled divestments, external factors may offer a more comprehensive explanation for this trend.\\n\\nIn essence, the stock market saw notable gains at the beginning of 2024. That in itself might be enough to realize some gains. But when coupled with an election year in the U.S., escalating tensions in the Middle East, and the prospect of prolonged higher interest rates, CEOs may view this as a time to seek safer investment avenues.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat are they buying?\\n\\nWhile selling at this level is not unprecedented, the seemingly condensed timeline over just a few months is noteworthy. Additionally, it prompts the question: What investments are these CEOs turning to in light of their divestitures?\\n\\nIf the primary goal behind these sell-offs is to seek refuge from global uncertainties, it logically follows that funds would be redirected to sectors known for their resilience during economic instability and shifting political climates.\\n\\nWe can see evidence of this with Buffett's recent activity. While selling Apple, he doubled down on oil giant Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Surely, its 4.4% dividend is attractive, but the buying comes amid a broader reallocation of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio to gain more exposure to energy and oil, two sectors known to do quite well amid an uncertain economic outlook.\\n\\nIn a similar vein, famed hedge fund manager Ray Dalio seems to be following the Oracle of Omaha's strategy to find defensive positions. In the last quarter, Dalio's Bridgewater Associates upped its stake in Altria Group (NYSE: MO), one of the world's major tobacco companies. While tobacco doesn't generally shine in bull markets, when things take a turn for the worst, tobacco generally weathers the storm fairly well as consumers continue to buy its products regardless of economic conditions. What's more, Altria currently offers a generous 9% dividend.\\n\\nThese moves highlight a growing trend of hedge funds seeking safe harbors. Data from Goldman Sachs shows that the rate of buying by hedge funds in historically defensive sectors, such as healthcare, utilities, and consumer staples, was at its highest in over eight months.\\n\\nKnown for their steadiness and resilience in volatile conditions, defensive sectors may see more buying from billionaires and hedge funds in the coming months as the geopolitical landscape shifts and a higher interest rate environment limits growth opportunities.\\n\\nWhat it means for you\\n\\nKeeping track of the investment activity of billionaires and hedge funds can provide valuable insights, but it doesn't mean copying their moves will lead to success for regular investors like you and me. They have vast resources at their disposal -- and often different goals than the average individual investor -- that might influence their stock moves.\\n\\nSo, what can we learn from their recent actions? Well, it seems there might be some bumpy roads ahead in the market. But that doesn't mean we should stop investing. Studies have shown that what matters more than trying to time the market is simply sticking with it over time. Stay consistent about investing in companies you believe in for the long haul, and your future self will be thanking you.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Chevron wasn\\u2019t one of them.

West Texas Intermediate, the primary U.S. benchmark price, is up more than 10% to nearly $80 a barrel. Higher crude prices are driving up most energy stocks.\\n\\nOne of the easiest ways to cash in on the oil-fueled rally in energy stocks is to invest in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) focused on the sector. They provide relatively broad exposure to the sector, enabling investors to enjoy some oil-fueled gains.\\n\\nEnergy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLE), Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE), and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSEMKT: XOP) stand out to some Fool.com contributors as the top energy ETFs to buy this month for those seeking to cash in on higher crude oil prices this year. Here's why they like them.\\n\\nThis energy fund has you well-covered\\n\\nReuben Gregg Brewer (Energy Select Sector SPDR): There's one thing you can count on when it comes to oil prices, and that's volatility. Right now oil prices are generally rising, but soon enough the prices could be heading lower again. In other words, if you're trying to cash in on higher oil prices you should, at the same time, think about hedging your bet against the risk of falling prices. Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF is as close as you can get to doing both of those things at the same time.\\n\\nEnergy Select SPDR ETF basically owns the energy stocks in the S&P 500 index. For starters, that means the energy stocks in the ETF have been vetted to ensure that they're large and economically important entities. That removes more risky investments from the mix. And Energy Select SPDR ETF is, like the S&P 500, market-cap weighted. So the largest energy companies make up the largest share of the ETF. In this instance, that means ExxonMobil and Chevron account for around 40% of the ETF's assets.\\n\\nExxon and Chevron are globally diversified, integrated energy giants. They're among the safest energy stocks you can own. Normally, I prefer ETFs with more diversified portfolios, but in the case of energy, being overweight in these two industry giants is a huge benefit.\\n\\nThe other 60% of the portfolio provides exposure to energy stocks that are likely to be more volatile, allowing you to see higher stock gains when oil prices are moving upward. If that doesn't pan out, however, the ETF still has the foundational investment in Exxon and Chevron to fall back on it.\\n\\nA solid fund to navigate the energy sector\\n\\nNeha Chamaria (Vanguard Energy ETF): If you're seeking exposure to oil and gas stocks amid higher oil prices, the Vanguard Energy ETF is one of your best bets. It's a low-cost fund, and its top holdings include some of the largest oil and gas stocks in the U.S. In fact, nearly 87% of the fund's assets are in large-cap stocks.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nExxonMobil and Chevron are the fund's two biggest holdings, respectively accounting for about 22% and 13.5% of its assets as of May 1. ConocoPhillips comes third, making up just over 7% of the fund's assets. Other notable top holdings include Schlumberger, Marathon Petroleum, and EOG Resources. The Vanguard Energy ETF is heavily focused on oil and gas producers, making it a no-brainer bet in a high oil-price environment.\\n\\nWith 116 stocks in its portfolio, the Vanguard Energy ETF is also one of the most diversified energy ETFs. By comparison, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, has only 25 stocks in its portfolio. The greater diversification can help investors in the fund mitigate risks.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the Vanguard Energy ETF gives you exposure to such a diversified group of top energy stocks for a low cost -- it has an expense ratio of only 0.10%. Also, since most of the top stocks in the fund's portfolio pay a dividend, the ETF currently yields 2.9%.\\n\\nWith the Vanguard Energy ETF, you get exposure to a basket of top oil and gas stocks and broad diversification -- all at a low cost and with a dividend, too. This makes it an ideal pick to ride an oil boom.\\n\\nA less concentrated approach\\n\\nMatt DiLallo (SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF): The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund and the Vanguard Energy ETF are great ways to gain exposure to the energy sector. However, they have one drawback. They're a bit top-heavy.\\n\\nAs my colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer pointed out above, Exxon and Chevron comprise about 40% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. Likewise, as Neha Chamaria notes, those two energy giants make up over 35% of the Vanguard Energy ETF. While outsized exposure to those big oil giants helps mute some risks, it adds others, including the fact that underperformance by one of the leaders could cause a lag in overall performance of the fund.\\n\\nThe SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF takes a different approach. Whereas those ETFs weigh their holdings by market cap, this oil stock ETF tracks a modified equal-weighed index of oil and gas companies. It provides unconcentrated exposure to oil and gas producers, currently holding 52 energy stocks with relatively equal weightings.\\n\\nIts largest holding was natural gas producer Antero Resources, with a 3.1% weighting. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil was its 10th largest holding at 2.7%. Overall, its top 10 holdings comprised only about 27% of the fund's value. This broader diversification enables smaller, faster-growing energy companies to have a greater impact on its value. In turn, that has helped fuel stronger performance by this fund over the past year:\\n\\nXOP Chart\\n\\nXOP data by YCharts\\n\\nHowever, there are some caveats. The ETF charges a higher expense ratio than those rival funds, at 0.35% vs. 0.09% for the Energy Select Sector fund and 0.1% for Vanguard Energy. That higher expense ratio will eat into the fund's returns over the long term.\\n\\nOn top of that, it's important to note that this fund's price will likely be more volatile than those other ETFs, given its broader exposure to smaller energy companies. Of course, this volatility can also work in your favor during periods of rising oil prices.\\n\\nShould you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\\n\\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\\n\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\\u2026 and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn\\u2019t one of them.

[ operator instructions ] this call is being recorded on tuesday, may 7, 2024. and i would now like to turn the conference over to clay jeansonne. thank you. please go ahead. clay jeansonne : thank you, operator. good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. joining me today to discuss our results are tim duncan, president and chief executive officer ; sergio maiworm, executive vice president and chief financial officer. for our prepared remarks, we will refer to our first quarter 2024 earnings slide presentation, which is available for viewing and downloading on talos \\u2019 website. starting on slide 2. cautionary statements, i \\u2019 d like to remind you that our remarks will include forward - looking statements. actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward - looking statements. factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in yesterday \\u2019 s press release and our form 10 - q for the period ending march 31, 2024, filed yesterday with the sec. forward - looking statements are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. during this call, we may present gaap and non - gaap financial measures. a reconciliation of gaap to non - gaap measures is included in yesterday \\u2019 s press release, which was filed with the sec and is available on our website. and now i \\u2019 d like to turn the call over to tim. tim duncan : thank you, clay, and welcome aboard. we \\u2019 re going to start this presentation on slide 3. we \\u2019 re going to discuss how we \\u2019 ve repositioned ourselves over the last year with the last two m & a deals. we \\u2019 re the fourth largest acreage holder in the gulf of mexico, and we \\u2019 re the fifth largest operator in the gulf of mexico. and we have two tenets to our strategy that we think are important. one,\",\n          \"we focus on oil - weighted assets, and two, we think it \\u2019 s critically important that we operate our deepwater infrastructure, and it allows us to focus our prospect inventory around this infrastructure and allows us to shorten our cycle times when we think about drilling these wells and getting them in first oil. let \\u2019 s go to slide 4, and talk about what might have been one of our busiest quarters in the company \\u2019 s history. we ended the year by bringing on venice and lime rock ahead of schedule and with sustained rates at over 18, 000 barrels equivalent a day. and in january we announced the quarternorth transaction, our second transaction of over $ 1 billion in the last year, adding important scale to our business. immediately after that transaction, we announced a couple of capital markets transactions, including lowering the cost capital of our debt by refinancing our high - yield notes. we were able to close the quarternorth transaction within 45 days, which helps us accelerate our synergies. we were also able to update our financial guidance, increasing our production guidance. and then later we also updated our debt guidance from $ 400 million to $ 550 million of debt repayments for the year. also within the quarter, we announced the divestiture of our ccs business to totalenergies. i \\u2019 ll speak more about the importance of that transaction on the next slide. so on page 5, we went through a lot of these highlights on page 4. let me focus on a couple of bullets on each side of this page. so first on the left side of the page, we had record production in the first quarter at the high end of our guidance, and you \\u2019 re going to see this go up tremendously in the second quarter. and sergio will talk about that later in the presentation. some of these other bullets i just discussed, but let me focus a little bit on the sale of tlcs business. we \\u2019 re bullish about what ccs can be long - term, but we did notice that emissions reductions were slowing down within these facilities and that capital requirements were going up. so we thought the right move for us was to transact on this business. we got a solid return over two times our money and immediately take those proceeds and accelerate our debt repayment. as we get to the right side of the page and focus on what we \\u2019 re trying to do from here, we think it \\u2019 s important to continue to remind the market that even though we \\u2019 re projecting 35 % to\",\n          \"although that \\u2019 s frustrating, it \\u2019 s an important planned downtime because it lets us work on the facility. it also lets us collect critical information on the pressures that we see downhole. and that \\u2019 s causing us to have more confidence in how we think this field will get developed. let \\u2019 s continue the conversation around katmai and talk about the katmai west number two well, and why we think it \\u2019 s so important. and there \\u2019 s a lot going on in the slide, but it helps understand how we think about better defining and expanding the resource when you have a deepwater discovery like katmai. so if you go on the graphic on the left, what we \\u2019 re showing you visually is where the katmai west number one well was drilled geologically in the structure. and then on the right, we \\u2019 re trying to help you understand how that better defines lowest known oil, which defines our proved reserves. and so you have a 400 - foot pay column that helps to find proved reserves and then to better expand what the resource could be, you have to have a combination of good production data, good pressure data, and then ultimately another geological test. that next geological test is katmai west number two well. we \\u2019 re going to extend the geological column and with that information and the pressure of data and the production data, we \\u2019 re going to have a better understanding on whether the potential of 100 million barrels is available to us. we think this is a very important well, it \\u2019 s a great use of capital allocation. and to talk more about capital allocation outside our drilling program, i \\u2019 m going to hand it over to sergio. sergio maiworm : thank you, tim, and good morning, everyone. thank you for joining our call today. as tim mentioned earlier in the call, we have increased our debt reduction target from $ 400 million to $ 550 million by the end of the year. also a couple of months ago in our last earnings call, we guided the market to expect a leverage target at the end of the year of one times or below, and we \\u2019 re actually able to achieve one times at the end of the first quarter. so we \\u2019 re way ahead on our target there, and i expect that number to continue to go down as we make additional debt reductions throughout the year. at the closing of the quarternorth transaction, our debt stood at $ 1. 8 billion. and that was a combination of $ 550 million on our rbl\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
